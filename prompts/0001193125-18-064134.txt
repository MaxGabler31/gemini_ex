ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company 
 When used in this report, the terms Cott, the Company, our Company, Cott Corporation, we, us, or our mean Cott Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. 
 We incorporated in 1955 and are governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act. Our registered Canadian office is located at 1100 boulevard Rene-Levesque Ouest, 25e etage, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3B 5C9 and our principal executive offices are located at 4221 W. Boy Scout Boulevard Suite 400, Tampa, Florida, United States 33607 and 1200 Britannia Road East, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L4W 4T5. 
 Cott is a route based service company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European home and office delivery (HOD) industry for bottled water and a leader in custom coffee roasting, blending of iced tea and extract solutions for the U.S. foodservice industry. Our platform reaches over 2.4 million customers or delivery points across North America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and distributors. This enables us to efficiently service residences, businesses, restaurant chains, hotels and motels, small and large retailers, and healthcare facilities. 
 On January 30, 2018, we sold our carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and juice businesses via the sale of our North America, United Kingdom (U.K.) and Mexico business units (including the Canadian business) and our Royal Crown International (RCI) finished goods export business (collectively, the Traditional Business) to Refresco Group N.V., a Dutch public company (Refresco), pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) dated as of July 24, 2017 (the Transaction). The Transaction was structured as a sale of the assets of our Canadian business and a sale of the stock of the operating subsidiaries engaged in the Traditional Business in the other jurisdictions. The aggregate deal consideration was $1.25 billion in cash, paid at closing, subject to adjustment for indebtedness, working capital, and other customary post-closing adjustments. Accordingly, as a result of the sale of the Traditional Business representing a strategic shift in our operations, those businesses are presented herein as discontinued operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. The Transaction did not include our Route Based Services and Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segments, our RCI concentrate business, our Columbus, Georgia manufacturing facility or our Aimia Foods Limited (Aimia) and Decantae Mineral Water Ltd. (Decantae) businesses. 
 The cash proceeds from the Transaction were used to (i) retire $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes), (ii) retire the remaining $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.000% senior secured notes due 2021 (the DSS Notes), (iii) repay $262.5 million outstanding balance on our asset-based lending facility (the ABL facility), and (iv) repay $1.9 million in aggregate principal outstanding on our capital lease finance arrangement with General Electric Capital Corporation (the GE Term Loan). Additionally, in connection with the closing of the Transaction on January 30, 2018, we entered into a second amendment and restatement agreement making effective an amended and restated senior secured asset-based lending credit facility (the ABL facility). The ABL facility, as amended and restated, under which Cott and its subsidiaries, Cott Holdings Inc., DS Services of America, Inc., S. & D. Coffee, Inc., Aimia Foods Limited and Aquaterra Corporation, are borrowers, is a revolving facility of up to $250.0 million, which may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our option if lenders agree to increase their commitments, with a maturity date of August 3, 2021. 
 Our Operations 
 At the beginning of 2017, our business operated through four reporting segments: Water and Coffee Solutions (which included our DS Services of America, Inc. (DSS), Aquaterra Corporation (Aquaterra), Eden Springs B.V. (Eden) and S. & D. Coffee, Inc. (S&D) businesses), Cott North America, Cott United Kingdom (Cott U.K.) and All Other (which included our Mexico and RCI operating segments). 
 During the third quarter of 2017, we reviewed our reporting segments as a result of the Transaction. Following such review, we reorganized our reporting segments into three reporting segments: Route Based Services (which includes our DSS, Aquaterra and Eden businesses), Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions (which includes our S&D business) and All Other (which includes our Aimia and Decantae businesses, the RCI concentrate business, our Columbus, Georgia manufacturing facility and other miscellaneous expenses). Segment reporting results have been recast to reflect these changes for all periods presented. Our corporate oversight function is not treated as a segment; it includes certain general and administrative costs that are not allocated to any of the reporting segments.

Route Based Services 
 Our Route Based Services reporting segment provides bottled water, coffee and water filtration services to customers in North America, Europe, and Israel. Route Based Services products include bottled water, coffee, brewed tea, water dispensers, coffee and tea brewers and filtration equipment. Route Based Services net revenue was $1,501.7 million, $1,224.3 million and $1,021.2 million, and represented 66.2%, 75.5% and 86.0% of our total net revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions 
 Our Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segment provides premium coffee roasting and customized coffee, tea and extract solutions to customers in the United States. Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions products include fresh brewed coffee or tea, speciality coffee, liquid coffee or tea concentrate, single cup coffee, cold brewed coffee, iced blend coffee or tea beverages, tea, blended teas, hot tea, sparkling tea, and coffee or tea extract solutions. Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions net revenue was $602.2 million and $228.0 million, and represented 26.5% and 14.0% of our total net revenue for 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
All Other 
 Our All Other segment consists of our Aimia, Decantae and the RCI concentrate businesses, our Columbus, Georgia manufacturing facility and other miscellaneous expenses. All Other products include hot chocolate, coffee, tea, soups, malt drinks, creamers/whiteners, cereals, beverage concentrates and mineral water. All Other net revenue was $165.8 million, $170.9 million and $166.1 million, and represented 7.3%, 10.5% and 14.0% of our total revenue for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Competitive Strengths 
 The combination of our scale and density of our routes in key markets, our industry-leading infrastructure, and our emphasis on superior customer service is intended to create significant competitive strengths. With respect to our Route Based Services and Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segments, we continually invest in our delivery infrastructure, call centers and service capabilities, as well as coffee roasting and extract capacity, to maintain our established position as a leader in these segments. We believe these investments have positioned us to capitalize on a number of positive industry dynamics and new growth opportunities. First, we intend to capture new customers as we capitalize on favorable consumer trends across our addressable markets, including increased focus on health and wellness, concerns about deteriorating municipal water quality and the shift to premium coffee systems and on the go coffee and tea purchases. Second, we believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water and coffee products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity. Third, the highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunity to make the most of our scale, systems and customer density to execute synergistic tuck-in acquisitions across all of our service areas. We believe these strengths, along with the strengths outlined below, will allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities to drive sustainable and profitable growth. 
Leading Position in Multiple Service Platforms 
 We have a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European HOD industry for bottled water. In bottled water, we offer a portfolio of well-known brands with longstanding heritages, such as Sparkletts, Hinckley Springs, Kentwood Springs, Canadian Springs, Labrador and Eden Springs, which have contributed to our leadership position in the HOD industry. In office coffee services (OCS), we offer a complete range of products under leading brands including Keurig®, Mars Alterra®, Starbucks® Coffee, Caribou Coffee®, Peets Coffee & Tea®, Javarama® and Lavazza®. 
 In coffee roasting, tea blending, and extract production, we are a leading custom coffee, tea and extract solutions provider, offering a portfolio of service offerings to our customers. Our superior scale, product development and expertise, as well as our focus on customer service, differentiates us from our competition as we are able to partner with our customers on logistics, supply chain and ongoing strategy development. 
 
6 
 
We are one of the only direct-to-customer providers that can offer comprehensive services to residential customers and small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large regional and national corporations and retailers, universities and government agencies. Our broad direct-to-consumer network creates an advantage in marketing and customer reach, while our extensive range of products and capabilities allows us to offer customers a convenient, single solution for coffee, tea and high quality drinking water. We believe our position will be further strengthened through our ongoing efforts to enhance and promote our full-service beverage offering to new and existing customers. 
 We also believe that opportunities exist to increase sales of our products in our core markets by optimizing existing customer relationships, capitalizing on cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, obtaining new customers, exploring new channels of distribution and introducing new products through our broad reaching distribution network. 
 Scale International HOD and OCS Platforms 
 We believe that having one of the leading North American and European HOD production and distribution networks in the industry gives us the ability to reduce our purchasing, manufacturing and delivery costs relative to our competitors as well as drive customer density within the markets we serve. We have an extensive HOD and OCS distribution network with a unique ability to service customers. We believe few companies have a comparable footprint or infrastructure to support local, regional and national accounts directly, which differentiates us in the industry. Our scaled network has allowed us to secure strategic relationships, which have been successful in attracting new customers and leveraging our production and delivery infrastructure. We are able to provide multiple products to our HOD and OCS customers at minimal additional cost and generate additional profits on those incremental sales. 
 The acquisition of Eden in 2016 further expanded our European capabilities. We believe that our large distribution footprint in the water-and-coffee solutions space in Europe differentiates us from our competitors, providing us with region wide coverage for our most significant businesses and allowing us to meet the water and coffee needs of our diversified customer base, including both small and medium sized businesses and larger European customer accounts. 
 High Levels of Customer Service and Strong Customer Integration 
 Customer service and customer retention are key indicators of success within our Route Based Services reporting segment. Route Sales Representatives or RSRs, who comprise the consumer-facing part of the business, are an important part of the customer relationship and not only drive customer service, but also generate new organic customer growth. Our Route Based Services reporting segment provides reliable deliveries and closely tracks call center and customer service metrics to continually improve customer satisfaction. 
 Customer service is a key driver in the success and growth of our Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segment. Customers have access to a vast array of services, including our commodity sourcing, product development, delivery systems and sustainability programs, as well as a number of other services. Our ability to customize these services and respond quickly to our customers needs are hallmarks for our high level of customer service. 
 Strategic Importance to Our Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions Customers 
 The acquisition of S&D in 2016 (and creation of our Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segment in 2017) made us a leader in custom coffee roasting and blending of foodservice iced teas in the United States. We believe the combination of S&Ds premium quality products and solutions, sourcing and distribution reach, and human capital assets create unmatched custom coffee, tea and extract production capabilities. 
 Our Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segment has a proven track record of working alongside our customers to create menu ideation and develop products to take to market. Our product development team develops differentiated and profitable menu items which span the culinary arts and food science, backed by our innovative coffee and liquid extract labs. In addition, we offer a sourcing capability staffed with a team of industry veterans. Coffee and tea markets are unpredictable, but with our industry expertise, we are able to guide our customers through the process utilizing our size, strength and relationships. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our vision is to be the preeminent international route based direct to consumer and service provider across water, coffee, tea, filtration and extract solutions with dedicated focus on shareowner returns through continuous growth, expanding margins, and growing free cash flow. Our business services profile offers recurring and repeatable revenue streams and scalable platforms which uniquely position us to allow for operational leverage with growth and to capture synergies through tuck-in acquisition opportunities. We intend to drive value creation through growth from our Better-for-You product

 offerings (positioned in growing categories of water, coffee, tea, filtration and extract solutions), focused innovation with product development, route logistics and technology creating further growth, as well as cross selling and customer service opportunities, margin expansion driven by scaled platforms with increased customer and route density, highly synergistic customer list or tuck-in acquisition opportunities, and strong free cash flow generation. 
 Focus on Water, Coffee, Tea, Filtration and Extract Services Growth 
 Our goal is to grow profitably as consumers move to healthier beverage options, and increase free cash flow by expanding our customer density and consumption, focusing on customer service and reducing costs to serve, as well as price improvement. 
 We will remain focused on expanding our small and medium-sized business customer base, a market segment that we believe remains underpenetrated, by continuing to capitalize on our strong direct-to-consumer distribution network, international sales and marketing efforts as well as our strategic partnerships. 
 We believe our ability to cross-sell complementary water, coffee, tea and filtration products and services represents a significant untapped opportunity as nearly all of our existing and target customers consume multiple products. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity utilizing our strong relationships and frequent face-to-face interactions with our large installed customer base. RSRs are trained to sell across our product set and are highly incentivized through our commission structure to promote new products to existing customers, which increases sales and average revenue per customer. 
 We intend to proactively pursue accretive acquisitions to complement our organic growth. The highly fragmented market in which we operate affords us ample opportunities to execute synergistic HOD water, OCS and filtration tuck-in acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is consistent with our objective to continually build customer density and reduce the overall cost of servicing our existing customer base. We have a proven track record of achieving significant synergies and integrating companies onto our platform and we believe that our acquisition strategy will continue to improve our profitability and margins. 
 We have managed to pursue this acquisition strategy while reducing leverage levels from the time of the acquisition of DSS by employing a combination of disciplined purchase pricing, successful integration and synergy realization, and divestiture of assets that are no longer instrumental to our mission and strategy. 
 Evaluate Acquisition Opportunities 
 We will continue to evaluate additional mid-to-larger scale opportunities (like the acquisitions of S&D and Eden) to expand our positions in the HOD water, coffee, tea, filtration and extract solution service categories, as well as other higher margin or growth-oriented categories where we believe our platform, operating strength and synergies can be leveraged. 
Financial Information about Segments 
 For financial information about reporting segments and geographic areas, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Ingredient and Packaging Supplies 
 In addition to water, the principal raw materials required to produce our products are green coffee, tea, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polycarbonate bottles, caps and preforms, labels and cartons and trays. The cost of these raw materials can fluctuate substantially over time. We have implemented a number of risk mitigation programs including our futures contracts and hedging programs with our customers in order to reduce the risk of commodity fluctuations in key areas such as coffee procurement and energy surcharges tied to certain energy indexes within North America. We also have implemented a number of sustainability programs throughout our network to assist our suppliers in operating under changing environments. Our core product of HOD bottled water utilizes a reusable bottle that allows for the overall cost to service to be spread out over a number of recurring trips to our customer base. Where we have not established a risk mitigation program, it is often necessary to recover the increased cost of materials through price increases which we have historically had success in utilizing in order to reduce our overall exposure to rising ingredient and packaging costs. 
 Under many of our supply arrangements for these raw materials, the price we pay fluctuates along with certain changes in underlying commodity costs, such as green coffee, tea, resin in the case of PET, and HDPE. We believe that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or find alternative sources for supply. We also believe there is adequate supply of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce and package our products.

Generally, we bear the risk of increases in the costs of the ingredient and packaging materials used to produce our products, including the underlying costs of the commodities used to manufacture them and, to some extent, the costs of converting those commodities into the materials we purchase. 
 Green coffee, tea, resin for PET, HDPE and fuel are examples of underlying commodities for which we bear the risk of increases in costs. In addition, the contracts for certain of our ingredient and packaging materials permit our suppliers to increase the costs they charge us based on increases in their cost of converting the underlying commodities into the materials we purchase. In certain cases those increases are subject to negotiated limits. Changes in the prices we pay for ingredient and packaging materials occur at times that vary by product and supplier, and take place on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
 A portion of our revenues is derived from coffee product distribution. The supply and price of coffee beans may be affected by weather, international conditions, consumer demand, and access to transportation. An increase in the price of coffee beans could reduce our coffee sales and coffee product margins, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Trade Secrets, Copyrights, Trademarks and Licenses 
 We sell a majority of our HOD three gallon (3G) and five gallon (5G) bottled water under our own brands while our OCS business sells both our branded products as well as products under which we have a distribution license. We sell a majority of our manufactured coffee and tea products under retailer or foodservice brands to customers who own the trademarks associated with those products. We own registrations, or applications to register, various trademarks that are important to our worldwide business, including Alhambra®, Belmont Springs®, Deep Rock®, Hinckley Springs®, Crystal Springs®, Kentwood Springs®, Mount Olympus®, Standard Coffee®, Javarama®, Athena®, Nursery®, Relyant®, Sierra Springs®, Sparkletts®, Constant Coffee®, Premium Gold®, S&D® and S&D Coffee & Tea® in the United States, Canadian Springs® and Labrador® in Canada, Eden®, Eden Springs®, Chateaudeau®, Edelvia®, Mey Eden®, Edenissimo®, Kafevend®, Pauza®, and Garraways® in Europe and Israel, and RC® mark in various formats in more than 120 countries and territories outside of North America. The licenses to which we are a party are of varying terms, including some that are perpetual. Trademark ownership is generally of indefinite duration when marks are properly maintained in commercial use. 
 Our success depends in part on our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets in the form of concentrate formulas for our beverages and trademarks for the names of the beverages we sell. To protect this intellectual property, we rely principally on registration of trademarks, contractual responsibilities and restrictions in agreements (such as indemnification, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements) with employees, consultants and customers, and on the common law and/or statutory protections afforded to trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We also closely monitor the use of our trademarks and when necessary vigorously pursue any party that infringes on our trademarks, using all available legal remedies. 
Customers 
 Our Traditional Business experienced some customer concentration. Following the closing of the Transaction on January 30, 2018, we have limited customer concentration, of which no customer accounts for more than 10% of our net revenues. 
Competition 
 Our principal competitor in the 3G and 5G HOD bottled water business in the United States is Nestlé, which competes with us directly in many of our markets. Within Canada and Europe, our principal competitors are local or regional HOD bottled water businesses. We face competition in our HOD business as distribution methods for residential and commercial bottled water products continue to change and evolve, including the increasing availability of 3G and 5G water bottles in retail stores. This could affect our business as some customers may choose to purchase water in returnable bottles through retailers rather than through our sales and distribution network. We have a strategic alliance with Primo Water Corporation (Primo) to bottle and distribute Primos 3G and 5G water bottles through retail stores, however, customers could choose to purchase Primos competitors retail products. Our HOD business also faces increased competition from filtration units in the residential and commercial market. Because homes and offices with installed filtration systems participate at a lower rate in the bottled water market, the installation of these systems poses a competitive threat to our business and reduces the number of potential customers for our bottled water products. In addition, consumers may choose to drink from municipal water sources instead of purchasing bottled water or using a filtration unit.

The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, wholesale foodservice distributors, regional institutional coffee roasters, and specialty coffee suppliers. If we do not succeed in differentiating ourselves through, among other things, our product and service offerings, then our competitive position may be weakened and our sales and profitability may be materially adversely affected. If, due to competitive pressures or contractual restrictions, we are required to reduce prices to attract market share or we are unable to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases and we are not able to increase sales volumes to offset the margin declines, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering our customers high-quality products, category management strategies, packaging and marketing strategies, efficient distribution methods, and superior service. 
 Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
 The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. 
 A number of states have passed laws setting forth warning or labeling requirements relating to products made for human consumption. For example, the California law known as Proposition 65 requires that a specific warning appear on any product sold in California containing a substance listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. This law, and others like it, exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. The detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label, although products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. From time to time over the past several years, certain of our customers have received notices alleging that the labeling requirements of the relevant state regulation would apply to products manufactured by us and sold by them. There can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by actions against our customers or us relating to Proposition 65 or similar failure to warn laws. 
 We currently offer and use non-refillable recyclable containers in the United States and other countries around the world. We also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and other countries requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. 
 We are a member of the International Bottled Water Association (IBWA) and the Water Quality Association. These associations often set higher water quality standards than those set by governmental agencies. Members must comply with these standards, which are enforced by the members themselves. The IBWA requires submission to annual plant inspections administered by an independent third-party inspection agency, such as the National Sanitation Foundation. These inspections audit quality and testing records, review all areas of plant operations and the bottling process, and check compliance with relevant national standards, good manufacturing practices, and any other regulations set by the IBWA. If we fail to meet the standards set by the IBWA and Water Quality Association, there could be an adverse impact on our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 All of our production facilities and other operations are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which pertain to the use of water resources and the discharge of waste water. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. 
 
10 
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable policies, we have coverage for product recalls and product liability claims that could result from the injury, illness or death of consumers using our products, contamination of our products, or damage to or mislabeling of our products. 
 Employees 
 As of December 30, 2017, we had over 10,400 employees, of whom approximately 8,600 were in the Route Based Services reporting segment, 1,200 were in the Coffee, Tea and Extract Solutions reporting segment, and 500 in All Other. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 770 of employees in the Route Based Services reporting segment that contain terms that we believe are typical in our industry. As these agreements expire, we believe that they can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We consider our relations with employees to be generally good. 
Availability of Information and Other Matters 
 We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information in the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Information filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities is available at www.sedar.com.
