Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies
 
Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies - Operations
 
The Company designs, develops and manufactures engineered, advanced composite materials and advanced composite structures and assemblies and low-volume tooling for the aerospace markets and prototype tooling for such structures and assemblies.
 
The Company’s aerospace composite materials are designed, developed and manufactured by the Company’s Park Aerospace Technologies Corp. (“PATC”) business unit located at the Newton, Kansas Airport and by the Company’s Nelco Products Pte. Ltd. business unit in Singapore. The Company’s aerospace composite structures and assemblies and low-volume tooling are also developed and manufactured by the Company’s PATC business unit.
 
PATC offers a full range of aerospace composite materials manufacturing capability, as well as composite structures design, assembly and production capability, all in its Newton facility.  PATC offers composite aircraft and space vehicle structures design and assembly services, in addition to “build-to-print” services. The Company believes that the ability of its PATC facility to offer such a wide and comprehensive array of composite materials and structures manufacturing and development technology and capability to the aircraft and space vehicle industries provides attractive benefits and advantages to those industries.
 
Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies – Industry Background
 
The aerospace composite materials manufactured by the Company and its competitors are used primarily to fabricate light-weight, high-strength structures with specifically designed performance characteristics. Composite materials are typically highly specified combinations of resin formulations and reinforcements. Reinforcements can be unidirectional fibers, woven fabrics, or non-woven goods such as mats or felts. Resin formulations are typically highly proprietary, and include various chemical and physical mixtures. The Company produces resin formulations using various epoxies, polyesters, phenolics, cyanate esters, polyimides and other complex matrices. The reinforcement combined with the resin is referred to as a “prepreg”. Aerospace composite materials can be broadly categorized as either thermosets or thermoplastics. While both material types require the addition of heat to form a consolidated laminate, thermoplastics can be reformed using additional heat. Once fully cured, thermoset materials cannot be further reshaped. The Company believes that the demand for thermoset advanced materials is greater than that for thermoplastics due to the fact that fabrication processes for thermoplastics require much higher temperatures and pressures and are, therefore, typically more capital intensive than the fabrication processes for thermoset materials.
 
The Company works with aerospace original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), such as general aviation aircraft manufacturers and commercial aircraft manufacturers, and certain tier 1 suppliers to qualify its aerospace composite materials or structures and assemblies for use on current and upcoming programs. The Company’s customers typically design and specify a material specifically to meet the needs of the structure’s end use and the customers’ processing methods. Such customers sometimes work with a supplier to develop the specific resin system and reinforcement combination to match the application. The Company’s customers’ processing, or the Company’s processing, may include hand lay-up, resin infusion or more advanced automated lay-up processes. Automated lay-up processes include automated tape lay-up, automated fiber placement and filament winding. These fabrication processes significantly alter the material form purchased. After the lay-up process is completed, the material is cured by the addition of heat and pressure. Cure processes typically include vacuum bag oven curing, high pressure autoclave, press forming and before-press curing. After the structure has been cured, final finishing and trimming, and assembly of the structure, is performed by the fabricator or the Company.

Although the Company’s aerospace composite material, structures and assemblies business is not dependent on any single customer, the loss of a major customer or of a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
The Company’s aerospace customers include fabricators of aircraft composite structures and assemblies. The Company’s aerospace composite materials are used by such fabricators and by the Company to produce primary and secondary structures, aircraft interiors and various other aircraft components. The Company’s customers for aerospace materials, and the Company itself, produce structures and assemblies for commercial aircraft and for the general aviation and business aviation, kit aircraft, special mission, UAVs and military markets. Many of the Company’s composite materials are used in the manufacture of aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”).
 
Customers for the Company’s rocket motor materials include United States defense prime contractors and subcontractors. These customers fabricate rocket motors for heavy lift space launchers, strategic defense weapons, tactical motors and various other applications. The Company’s materials are used to produce heat shields, exhaust gas management devices and insulative and ablative nozzle components. Rocket motors are primarily used for commercial and military space launch, and for tactical and strategic weapons. The Company also has customers for these materials outside of the United States.
 
The Company also sells composite materials for use in RF electrical applications. Customers buying these materials typically fabricate antennas and radomes engineered to preserve electrical signal integrity. A radome is a protective cover over an electrical antenna or signal generator. The radome is designed to minimize signal loss and distortion.
 
Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies – Manufacturing 
 
The Company’s manufacturing facilities for aerospace composite materials are currently located in Newton, Kansas and in Singapore, and its manufacturing facility for composite structures and assemblies is also located in Newton, Kansas. See “Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies – Operations” elsewhere in this Report.
 
The process for manufacturing composite materials, structures and assemblies is capital intensive and requires sophisticated equipment, significant technical know-how and very tight process controls. The key steps used in the manufacturing process include resin mixing, resin film casting and reinforcement impregnation via hot-melt process or a solution process.
 
Prepreg is manufactured by the Company using either solvent (solution) coating methods on a treater or by hot melt impregnation. A solution treater is a roll-to-roll continuous process machine which sequences reinforcement through tension controllers and combines solvated resin with the reinforcement. The reinforcement is dipped in resin, passed through a drying oven which removes the solvent and advances (or partially cures) the resin. The prepreg material is interleafed with a carrier and cut to the roll lengths desired by the customer. The Company also manufactures prepreg using hot melt impregnation methods which use no solvent. Hot melt prepreg manufacturing is achieved by mixing a resin formulation in a heated resin vessel, casting a thin film on a carrier paper, and laminating the reinforcement with the resin film.

The Company also completes additional processing services, such as slitting, sheeting, biasing, sewing and cutting, if needed by the customer. Many of the products manufactured by the Company also undergo extensive testing of the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the product. These testing requirements are completed in the laboratories and facilities located at the Company’s manufacturing facilities.
 
The Company’s laboratories have been approved by several aerospace OEMs, and the Company has achieved certification pursuant to the National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (“NADCAP”) for both non-metallic materials manufacturing and testing and composites fabrication. After all the processing has been completed, the product is tested and packaged for shipment to the customer. The Company typically supplies final product to the customer in roll or sheet form.  The Company’s PATC facility has received accreditation by NADCAP for composite structures manufacturing and for composite materials manufacturing, and the Company believes that the PATC facility is one of the few facilities in the world with NADCAP accreditation for manufacturing both composite materials and composite structures.  The Company has also received AS9100C certification for its quality management system for the manufacture of advanced composite materials and design and manufacturing of structures for aircraft and aerospace industries.
 
Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies – Materials and Sources of Supply
 
The Company designs and manufactures its aerospace composite materials to its own specifications and to the specifications of its customers. Product development efforts are focused on developing prepreg materials that meet the specifications of the customers. The materials used in the manufacture of these engineered materials include graphite and carbon fibers and fabrics, aramids, such as Kevlar® ("Kevlar" is a registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.) and Twaron® (“Twaron” is a registered trademark of Teijin Twaron B.V. LLC), quartz, fiberglass, polyester, specialty chemicals, resins, films, plastics, adhesives and certain other synthetic materials. The Company purchases these materials from several suppliers. Substitutes for many of these materials are not readily available. The qualification and certification of aerospace composite materials for certain FAA certified aircraft typically include specific requirements for raw material supply and may restrict the Company’s flexibility in qualifying alternative sources of supply for certain key raw materials. The Company continues to work to determine acceptable alternatives for several raw materials.
 
The Company manufactures composite structures and assemblies primarily to its customers’ specifications using its own composite materials or composite materials supplied by third parties, based on the specific requirements of the Company’s customers. 
 
Aerospace Composite Materials, Structures and Assemblies – Competition
 
The Company has many competitors in the aerospace composite materials, structures and assemblies markets, ranging in size from large international corporations to small regional producers. Several of the Company’s largest competitors are vertically integrated, producing raw materials, such as carbon fiber and cloth, as well as composite structures and assemblies. Some of the Company’s competitors may also serve as a supplier to the Company. The Company competes for business primarily on the basis of responsiveness, product performance and consistency, product qualification, FAA data base design allowables and innovative new product development.

Electronics Materials
 
Electronics Materials - Operations
 
The Company is also a leading global designer and manufacturer of advanced electronics materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnection systems, such as multilayer back-planes, wireless packages, high-speed/low-loss multilayers and high density interconnects (“HDIs”). The Company’s multilayer printed circuit materials consist of copper-clad laminates and prepregs, which is an acronym for pre-impregnated material. The Company has long-term relationships with its major customers, which include leading independent printed circuit board fabricators, electronic manufacturing service companies, electronic contract manufacturers and major electronic original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). Multilayer printed circuit boards and interconnect systems are used in virtually all advanced electronic equipment to direct, sequence and control electronic signals between semiconductor devices (such as microprocessors and memory and logic devices), passive components (such as resistors and capacitors) and connection devices (such as infra-red couplings, fiber optics, compliant pin and surface mount connectors). Examples of end uses of the Company’s digital printed circuit materials include high speed routers and servers, telecommunications switches, storage area networks, supercomputers, satellite switching equipment and wireless local area networks ("LANs"). The Company's RF/microwave printed circuit materials are used primarily for military avionics, antennas, power amplifiers and other components for cellular telephone base stations, automotive adaptive cruise control systems and avionic communications equipment. The Company has developed long-term relationships with major customers as a result of its leading edge products, extensive technical and engineering service support and responsive manufacturing capabilities.
 
Park believes it founded the modern day printed circuit industry in 1957 by inventing a composite material consisting of an epoxy resin substrate reinforced with fiberglass cloth which was laminated together with sheets of thin copper foil. This epoxy-glass copper-clad laminate system is still used to construct the large majority of today’s advanced printed circuit products. The Company also believes that in 1962 it invented the first multilayer printed circuit materials system used to construct multilayer printed circuit boards. The Company also pioneered vacuum lamination and many other manufacturing technologies used in the industry today. The Company believes it is one of the industry’s technological leaders.
 
The Company believes that it is one of only a few significant independent manufacturers of high performance multilayer printed circuit materials in the world. The Company was the first manufacturer in the printed circuit materials industry to establish manufacturing presences in the three major global markets of North America, Europe and Asia, with facilities established in Europe in 1969 and Asia in 1986.
 
Electronics Materials – Industry Background
 
The electronics materials manufactured by the Company and its competitors are used primarily to construct and fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other advanced electronic interconnection systems. Multilayer printed circuit materials consist of prepregs and copper-clad laminates. Prepregs are chemically and electrically engineered thermosetting or thermoplastic resin systems which are impregnated into and reinforced by a specially manufactured fiberglass cloth product or other woven or non-woven reinforcing fiber. This insulating dielectric substrate generally is 0.125 inch to 0.001 inch in thickness. While these resin systems historically have been based on epoxy resin chemistry, in recent years, increasingly demanding OEM requirements have driven the industry to utilize proprietary enhanced epoxies as well as other higher performance resins, such as phenolic, bismalimide triazine ("BT"), cyanate ester, standard and enhanced non-Methylene Dianiline (“MDA”) polyimide, allylated polyphenylene ether (“APPE”) or polytetrafluoroethylene ("PTFE"). One or more plies of prepreg are laminated together to form an insulating dielectric substrate to support the copper circuitry patterns of a multilayer printed circuit board. Copper-clad laminates consist of one or more plies of prepreg with each ply laminated on the top and bottom with specialty thin copper foil. Copper foil is specially formed in thin sheets which may vary from 0.0056 inch to 0.0002 inch in thickness and normally have a thickness of 0.0014 inch or 0.0007 inch. The Company supplies both copper-clad laminates and prepregs to its customers, which use these products as a system to construct multilayer printed circuit boards.

The printed circuit board fabricator processes copper-clad laminates to form the inner layers of a multilayer printed circuit board. The fabricator photo images these laminates with a dry film or liquid photoresist. The photoresist is then developed with the circuit pattern.  The unexposed areas are stripped, leaving a cured photoresist circuit pattern protecting the copper. The copper surfaces of the laminate are etched to form the circuit pattern, and the remaining photoresist is stripped. The fabricator then assembles these etched laminates by inserting one or more plies of dielectric prepreg between each of the inner layer etched laminates and also between an inner layer etched laminate and the outer layer copper plane, and then laminating the entire assembly in a press. Prepreg serves as the insulator and bond between the multiple layers of copper circuitry patterns found in the multilayer circuit board. When the multilayer configuration is laminated, these plies of prepreg form an insulating dielectric substrate supporting and separating the multiple inner and outer planes of copper circuitry. The fabricator drills vertical through-holes or vias in the multilayer assembly and then plates the through-holes or vias to form vertical conductors between the multiple layers of circuitry patterns. These through-holes or vias combine with the conductor paths on the horizontal circuitry planes to create a three-dimensional electronic interconnect system. In specialized applications, an additional set of microvia layers may be added through a series of lamination processes to provide increased density and functionality to the design. The outer two layers of copper foil are then imaged and etched to form the finished multilayer printed circuit board. The completed multilayer board is a three-dimensional interconnect system with electronic sig-nals traveling in the horizontal planes of multiple layers of copper circuitry patterns, as well as in the vertical planes through the plated holes or vias.
 
Semiconductor manufacturers have introduced successive generations of more powerful microprocessors and memory and logic devices. Electronic equipment manufacturers have designed these advanced semiconductors into more compact products. High performance computing devices in these smaller platforms require greater reliability, faster signal speeds, closer tolerances, higher component and circuit density and increased overall complexity. As a result, the interconnect industry has developed smaller, lighter, faster and more cost-effective interconnect systems, including advanced multilayer printed circuit boards.
 
Today’s interconnect systems require advanced technology printed circuit materials to ensure the performance and reliability of the electronic system and to improve the manufacturability of the interconnect platform. Printed circuit board fabricators and electronic equipment manufacturers require advanced printed circuit materials that have increasingly higher temperature tolerances and more advanced and stable electrical properties in order to support high-speed computing in a miniaturized and often portable environment. Temperature tolerance was further emphasized by the advent of lead-free assemblies.
 
 10



The uniformity, purity, consistency, performance predictability, dimensional stability and production tolerances of printed circuit materials have become successively more critical due to the very high density circuit demands of miniaturized high performance interconnect systems. High density printed circuit boards and interconnect systems often involve higher layer count multilayer circuit boards where the multiple planes of circuitry and dielectric insulating substrates are very thin (dielectric insulating substrate layers may be 0.002 inch or less) and the circuit line and space geometries in the circuitry plane are very narrow (0.002 inch or less). In addition, advanced surface mount interconnect systems are typically designed with very small pad sizes and very small plated through-holes or vias which electrically connect the multiple layers of circuitry planes, and these interconnect systems frequently make use of multiple lamination cycles and/or laser drilled vias. High density interconnect systems must utilize printed circuit materials whose dimensional characteristics and purity are consistently manufactured to very high tolerance levels in order for the printed circuit board fabricator to attain and sustain acceptable product yields.
 
Shorter product life cycles and competitive pressures have induced electronic equipment manufacturers to bring new products to market and increase production volume to commercial levels more quickly. These trends have highlighted the importance of front-end engineering of electronic products and have increased the level of collaboration among system designers, fabricators and printed circuit materials suppliers. As the complexity of electronic products increases, materials suppliers must provide greater technical support to interconnect systems fabricators on a timely basis regarding manufacturability and performance of new materials systems.
 
Electronics Materials – Products and Services
 
The Company produces a broad line of advanced electronics materials used to fabricate complex multilayer printed circuit boards and other electronic interconnect systems, including backplanes, high speed/low loss multilayers and high density interconnects (“HDIs”). The Company’s diverse advanced electronics materials product line is designed to address a wide array of end-use applications and performance requirements.
 
The Company’s electronics materials products have been developed internally and through long-term development projects with its principal suppliers and, to a lesser extent, through licensing arrangements. The Company focuses its research and development efforts on developing industry leading product technology to meet the most demanding product requirements and has designed its product line with a focus on the higher performance, higher technology end of the materials spectrum.
 
The Company’s products utilize, among other things, high-speed, low-loss, engineered formulations, high-temperature modified epoxies, phenolics, BT epoxies, MDA-free polyimides, enhanced polyimides, APPE, SI® (Signal Integrity) products, cyanate esters and PTFE formulations for RF/microwave applications.

The Company seeks customers which are industry leaders committed to maintaining and improving their industry leadership positions and which are committed to long-term relationships with their suppliers. The Company also seeks business opportunities with the more advanced printed circuit fabricators and electronic equipment manufacturers who are interested in maximizing the full value of the products and services provided by their suppliers. The Company believes its proactive and timely support in assisting its customers with the integration of advanced materials technology into new product designs further strengthens its relationships with its customers.
 
 11



The Company’s emphasis on service and close relationships with its customers is reflected in its short lead times. The Company has developed its manufacturing processes and customer service organizations to provide its customers with printed circuit materials products on a just-in-time basis. The Company believes that its ability to meet its customers' customized manufacturing and quick-turn-around ("QTA") requirements is one of its unique strengths.

The Company’s customers for its advanced electronics materials include the leading independent printed circuit board fabricators, electronic manufacturing service (“EMS”) companies, electronic contract manufacturers (“ECMs”) and major electronic OEMs in the computer, networking, telecommunications, wireless communications, aerospace, military, instrumentation and automotive industries located throughout North America, Europe and Asia. The Company seeks to align itself with the larger, more technologically-advanced and better capitalized independent printed circuit board fabricators and major electronic equipment manufacturers which are industry leaders committed to maintaining and improving their industry leadership positions and to building long-term relationships with their suppliers. The Company’s selling effort typically involves several stages and relies on the talents of Company personnel at different levels, from management to sales personnel and quality engineers. The Company augments its sales personnel with an OEM marketing team and process and product technology specialists.
 
During the Company’s 2018 fiscal year, 14.9% of the Company's total worldwide sales were to TTM Technologies, Inc., a leading manufacturer of printed circuit boards. During the Company’s 2017 fiscal year, approximately 16.2% of the Company's total worldwide sales were to TTM Technologies, Inc. During the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, approximately 13.8% of the Company's total worldwide sales were to TTM Technologies, Inc. During the Company’s 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, sales to no other electronics materials customer of the Company equaled or exceeded 10% of the Company’s total worldwide sales.
 
Although the Company’s electronics materials business is not dependent on any single customer, the loss of a major customer or of a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated results of operations or financial position.
 
The Company’s electronics materials products are marketed primarily by sales personnel and, to a lesser extent, by independent distributors and independent sales representatives in Europe and Asia.
 
Electronics Materials – Manufacturing
 
The process for manufacturing multilayer printed circuit materials is capital intensive and requires sophisticated equipment as well as clean-room environments. The key steps in the Company’s manufacturing process include: the impregnation of specially designed fiberglass cloth with a specially designed resin system and the partial curing of that resin system; the assembling of laminates consisting of single or multiple plies of prepreg and copper foil in a clean-room environment; the vacuum lamination of the copper-clad assemblies under simultaneous exposure to heat, pressure and vacuum; and the finishing of the laminates to customer specifications.
 
 12



Prepreg is manufactured in a treater. A treater is a roll-to-roll continuous machine which sequences specially designed fiberglass cloth or other reinforcement fabric into a resin tank and then sequences the resin-coated cloth through a series of ovens which partially cure the resin system into the cloth. This partially cured product or prepreg is then sheeted or paneled and packaged by the Company for sale to customers, or used by the Company to construct its copper-clad laminates.
 
The Company manufactures copper-clad laminates by first setting up in a clean room an assembly of one or more plies of prepreg stacked together with a sheet of specially manufactured copper foil on the top and bottom of the assembly. This assembly, together with a large quantity of other laminate assemblies, is then inserted into a large, multiple opening vacuum lamination press. The laminate assemblies are then laminated under simultaneous exposure to heat, pressure and vacuum. After the press cycle is complete, the laminates are removed from the press and sheeted, sheared and finished to customer specifications. The product is then inspected and packaged for shipment to the customer.
 
The Company manufactures multilayer printed circuit materials at fully integrated facilities located in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia. The Company opened its California facility in 1965, its Arizona facility in 1984, its Singapore facility in 1986 and its France facility in 1992. The Company services the North American market principally through its United States manufacturing facilities, the European market principally through its manufacturing facilities in the United States and in France, and the Asian market principally through its Singapore manufacturing facility. By maintaining technical and engineering staffs at each of its manufacturing facilities, the Company is able to deliver fully-integrated products and services on a timely basis. During the 2018 fiscal year, the Company consolidated its Nelco Products, Inc. business unit located in California and its Neltec, Inc. business unit located in Arizona, and all manufacturing at the California facilities ceased, except for treating operations, which continue as part and under the supervision of the Neltec, Inc. business unit. 
 
Electronics Materials – Materials and Sources of Supply
 
The principal materials used in the manufacture of the Company’s electronics materials products are specially manufactured copper foil, fiberglass and quartz cloth and synthetic reinforcements, and specially formulated resins and chemicals. The Company develops and maintains close working relationships with suppliers of these materials who have dedicated themselves to complying with the Company’s stringent specifications and technical requirements. While the Company’s philosophy is to work with a limited number of suppliers, the Company has identified alternate sources of supply for many, but not all, of these materials. However, there are a limited number of qualified suppliers of these materials, in some cases substitutes for these materials are not always readily available, and, in the past, the industry has experienced shortages in the market for certain of these materials. While the Company considers its relationships with its suppliers to be strong, a shortage of these materials or a disruption of the supply of materials caused by a natural disaster, such as the temporary disruption caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, or otherwise, could materially increase the Company’s cost of operations and could materially adversely affect the business and results of operations of the Company.
 
Significant increases in the cost of materials purchased by the Company could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations if the Company were unable to pass such increases through to its customers. During the 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, the Company experienced significant volatility in the cost of copper foil, one of the Company’s primary raw materials. The Company generally passes changes in the costs of its raw materials through to its customers.
 
 13



Electronics Materials – Competition
 
The multilayer printed circuit materials industry is characterized by intense competition and ongoing consolidation. The Company’s competitors are primarily divisions or subsidiaries of very large, diversified multinational manufacturers which are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than the Company and, to a lesser degree, smaller regional producers. Because the Company focuses on the higher technology segment of the electronics materials market, technological innovation, quality and service, as well as price, are significant competitive factors.
 
The Company believes that there are several significant multilayer printed circuit materials manufacturers in the world and many of these competitors have significant presences in the three major global markets of North America, Europe and Asia. The Company believes that it is one of only a few significant independent manufacturers of multilayer printed circuit materials in the world today.
 
The markets in which the Company’s electronics materials operations compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, and the Company’s position in these markets depends largely on its continued ability to develop technologically advanced and highly specialized products. Although the Company believes it is an industry technology leader and directs a significant amount of its time and resources toward maintaining its technological competitive advantage, there is no assurance that the Company will be technologically competitive in the future, or that the Company will continue to develop new products that are technologically competitive.
 
Electronics Materials – Strategic Evaluation
 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced that it is conducting a strategic evaluation, including the potential sale, of its electronics materials business and that it has retained Greenhill & Co., LLC, as its financial advisor, to assist it in the strategic evaluation of the electronics business, which includes manufacturing locations in Singapore, France, California and Arizona and R&D facilities in Singapore and Arizona.  Under any strategic alternative for its electronics business, the Company would retain its aerospace manufacturing operations in Kansas, its headquarters in New York and its aerospace composite materials manufacturing facility in Singapore.  The Company expects to conclude its strategic evaluation of its electronics business in the second quarter of its 2019 fiscal year ending March 3, 2019.  However, no specific timetable has been set, and there can be no assurance that a sale or any other transaction will take place as a result of the strategic evaluation.
Backlog
 
The Company considers an item as backlog when it receives a purchase order specifying the number of units to be purchased, the purchase price, specifications and other customary terms and conditions. At May 1, 2018, the unfilled portion of all purchase orders received by the Company and believed by it to be firm was $18,151,314, compared to $14,642,952 at May 1, 2017. A major portion of the Company’s backlog consists of composite materials.
 
Various factors contribute to the size of the Company’s backlog. Accordingly, the foregoing information may not be indicative of the Company’s results of operations for any period subsequent to the fiscal year ended February 25, 2018.

The Company holds several patents and trademarks or licenses thereto. In the Company’s opinion, some of these patents and trademarks are important to its products. Generally, however, the Company does not believe that an inability to obtain new; or to defend existing, patents and trademarks would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Employees

Environmental Matters
 
The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation of its use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and the release of emissions into the environment. The Company believes that it currently is in substantial compliance with the applicable Federal, state and local and foreign environmental laws and regulations to which it is subject and that continuing compliance therewith will not have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. The Company does not currently anticipate making material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities for its existing manufacturing operations during the remainder of its current fiscal year or its succeeding fiscal year. However, developments, such as the enactment or adoption of even more stringent environmental laws and regulations, could conceivably result in substantial additional costs to the Company.
 
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) or a comparable state agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the “Superfund Act”) or similar state law as potentially responsible parties in connection with alleged releases of hazardous substances at four sites.
 
Under the Superfund Act and similar state laws, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste disposal site or contaminated area identified by the EPA or comparable state agency may be jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup. Generally, these sites are locations at which numerous persons disposed of hazardous waste. In the case of the Company’s subsidiaries, generally the waste was removed from their manufacturing facilities and disposed at the waste sites by various companies which contracted with the subsidiaries to provide waste disposal services. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been accused of or charged with any wrongdoing or illegal acts in connection with any such sites. The Company believes it maintains an effective and comprehensive environmental compliance program. Management believes the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, capital resources, business, consolidated results of operations or financial position of the Company.

Factors That May Affect Future Results
 
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their companies without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement. Certain portions of this Report which do not relate to historical financial information may be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from Park's expectations or from results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
 
Generally, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “goal,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue” and similar expressions or the negative or other variations thereof. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations that involve a number of uncertainties and risks that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations.
 
The factors described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Report, as well as the following additional factors, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from any such results which might be projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted by the Company in forward-looking statements.
 

● | The Company's operating results are affected by a number of factors, including various factors beyond the Company's control. Such factors include economic conditions in the electronics materials, aerospace composite materials and composite structures and assemblies industries, the timing of customer orders, product prices, process yields, the mix of products sold and maintenance-related shutdowns of facilities. Operating results also can be influenced by development and introduction of new products, the costs associated with the start-up of new facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company, from time to time, is engaged in the expansion of certain of its manufacturing facilities. The anticipated costs of such expansions cannot be determined with precision and may vary materially from those budgeted. In addition, such expansions will increase the Company's fixed costs. The Company's future profitability depends upon its ability to utilize its manufacturing capacity in an effective manner. 
● | The Company may acquire businesses, product lines or technologies that expand or complement those of the Company. The integration and management of an acquired company or business may strain the Company's management resources and technical, financial and operating systems. In addition, implementation of acquisitions can result in large one-time charges and costs. A given acquisition, if consummated, may materially affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.

● | The Company's future success depends in part upon its intellectual property which the Company seeks to protect through a combination of contract provisions, trade secret protections, copyrights and patents. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The market price of the Company’s securities can be subject to fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results, changes in analyst earnings estimates, market conditions in the electronics materials, aerospace composite materials and composite structures and assemblies industries, as well as general economic conditions and other factors external to the Company.
● | The Company’s operating results could be affected by changes in the Company’s accounting policies and practices or changes in the Company’s organization, compensation and benefit plans, or changes in the Company’s material agreements or understandings with third parties. 

 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced that it is conducting a strategic evaluation, including the potential sale, of its electronics materials business and that it has retained Greenhill & Co., LLC, as its financial advisor, to assist it in such strategic evaluation. The Company expects to conclude the strategic evaluation of its electronics business in the second quarter of the 2019 fiscal year ending March 3, 2019. However, no specific timetable has been set, and potential risks and uncertainties of the strategic evaluation include that (i) there can be no assurance that a sale or any other transaction will take place or be consummated as a result of such strategic evaluation, (ii) the announcement of a potential transaction may negatively affect the Company’s business relationships (including, without limitation, customers and suppliers) and its employees, (iii) failure to complete a potential transaction could negatively impact the market price of the Company’s common stock and the future business and financial results of the Company, (iv) significant expenses may be incurred by the Company in consideration of a potential transaction and contingent expenses may result if a potential transaction is consummated, and (v) management’s attention may be diverted from the Company’s ongoing business operations during consideration of a potential transaction. In the event that a sale of the Company’s electronics business is consummated, the Company would be subject to the following additional risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations:
 

● | The Company would have greater exposure to the risks of the aerospace industry generally, including volume of commercial and business air travel, airline industry confidence and investment, energy and fuel costs, global military and defense budgets, global politics and trade policy, global environmental and conservation policy, aerospace OEM product life cycles and new program development, and overall perception of air travel safety, convenience, and affordability versus other modes of transportation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company would have a greater portion of its production concentrated in fewer manufacturing locations. Natural disasters, location specific labor issues or business or environmental regulation would have a greater impact on the operations of the overall Company. 
● | The Company’s revenue derived from its top customer would be larger as a percentage of total revenue. Factors relating to pricing and contract negotiation, timing of purchases, and the overall customer relationship would be more critical and could adversely affect the Company’s overall operations to a greater degree. 
● | The Company would have increased risk, relative to its overall operations, associated with a certain supplier, which is the sole source supplier for many of the Company’s products. Any disruption, economic changes or quality issues with this supplier could negatively affect the Company’s overall operations to a greater degree. 
● | The Company would have increased dependency on certain aircraft OEM programs. The Company has significant exposure to certain aircraft programs that are subject to market demand, manufacturing delays or issues, safety or qualification issues, and trade, tax and political issues, which could negatively affect the Company. 
● | The Company would have increased vulnerability to changes in supply chain or sourcing strategies by Tier 1 aerospace suppliers or OEMs. OEMs may decide to bring fabrication or assembly work that is currently performed by the Company’s direct customers in-house. OEMs may also demand price reductions of the Company’s direct customers, which may have an adverse effect on the Company. 
● | The Company would be increasingly dependent on the commercial success of certain jet engine programs, which are in direct competition with other jet engine programs on factors such as price, efficiency, repair and maintenance factors and timely delivery, which are outside the Company’s direct control.
