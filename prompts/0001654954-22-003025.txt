ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General

We were incorporated on July 17, 2006, under the laws of British Columbia, Canada under the name Golden Predator Mines Inc. We were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Metals Corp. for the purpose of holding precious metals and certain specialty metals assets. In order to focus on specialty metals, during February 2009 we transferred most of our precious mineral assets to our then wholly owned subsidiary Golden Predator Corp., and on March 6, 2009 we completed a spin-out of Golden Predator Corp. to our shareholders. Effective March 12, 2009, we changed our name to EMC Metals Corp. In order to reflect a new emphasis on mining for scandium minerals, effective November 19, 2014, we changed our name to Scandium International Mining Corp (“SCY” or the “Company”).

We are a reporting issuer in the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and our common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “SCY.” 

Our head office is located at 1430 Greg Street, Suite 501, Sparks, Nevada 89431. The address of our registered office is 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T8.     

Our most advanced project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, located in New South Wales, Australia (the “Nyngan Scandium Project”), on which we hold a mine lease grant and a development consent. We also hold an exploration license on a scandium mineral property located near Nyngan known as the “Honeybugle Scandium property” and a reservation on an exploration license on a scandium mineral property in Finland, known as the “Kiviniemi Scandium property.” 

In addition to these scandium mining project interests, the Company is pursuing copper industry interest in our ion exchange (IX) and solvent extraction (SX) technology and knowhow, to recover high purity alumina (HPA), scandium, nickel, cobalt and other technology-driven metals from mineral processing solutions and other acidic waste streams in certain acid leach copper operations. This project effort is known as the “Critical Metals Recovery (CMR) Project,” with a specific focus on North American opportunities.

Our plan of operation for 2021 has been to obtain copper industry partners for our critical metals harvesting technology, and subsequently initiate discussions regarding offtake sales agreements with counterparties for those critical metals planned to be produced at participating separation sites. In June of 2021, we announced an LOI with a copper industry partner which established a development path for this strategy.

Our plan of operation for 2022 is to progress development of our CMR Project with our partner to the point where we can make joint decisions to build a production facility, and to pursue relevant sales agreements related to that contemplated production facility. We also intend to continue pursuit of scandium product customers for offtakes, either from our critical metals projects or from the Nyngan Scandium Project. We will also seek additional funding for corporate working capital and CMR project development costs in 2022.

Pursuant to a share exchange agreement dated June 30, 2017, the Company acquired the remaining 20% interest in EMC Metals Australia Pty. Ltd. from Scandium Investments LLC (“SIL”). On completion of the share exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 58,830,645 common shares to SIL and granted to SIL the right to nominate two individuals to the board of the Company for so long as SIL holds at least 15% of SCY’s issued and outstanding shares, and one director for so long as SIL holds at least 5% but less than 15% of SCY’s issued and outstanding shares.  

Business Operations

Company, Projects and Markets Summary

We are a mineral exploration and development company that is primarily focused on the development of critical metals recovery projects from mine-based feedstock sources, principally in North America, and from mine-based scandium mineral resources, principally in Australia. The Company has previously also considered exploration and project development opportunities in rare earth minerals, and other specialty metals, specifically including nickel, cobalt, boron, manganese, tantalum, titanium, and zirconium. We have not commenced construction on of any of our mineral development projects, and as a result we are an exploration stage company.  

Our most advanced project is the Nyngan Scandium Project, located in New South Wales, Australia (the “Nyngan Scandium Project”), on which we hold a mine lease grant, a development consent, and 100% of the mineral rights. The Company has completed a definitive feasibility study on the Nyngan Scandium Project dated May 4, 2016 (the “Feasibility Study” or “DFS”), which was prepared independently in accordance with NI 43-101. The results of the DFS include a 16.9 million tonne measured and indicated resource (grading 235ppm at a 100ppm cut-off) and a 1.43 million tonne mineral reserve (combined proven and probable), based on economics established in that study. The DFS was filed on May 6, 2016 and is available on SEDAR (www.sedar.com), on the Company’s website (www.scandiummining.com) and on the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). A summary of the DFS is provided herein under “
