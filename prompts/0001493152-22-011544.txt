Participation Agreement to Explore and Develop Unconventional Gas and Brine Materials in the Hugoton Gas Field
 
Effective April 4, 2022, pursuant to the participation agreement by and between SunFlower Exploration, LLC (“SunFlower”) and the Company (the “Participation Agreement”), the Company acquired a 40% participation right in that certain Farmout Agreement, effective as of February 2022 by and between Scout Energy Management, LLC (“Scout”) and SunFlower (the “Farmout Agreement”) with regards to oil, natural gas, helium and brine mineral interests in the Hugoton Gas Field, located in Haskell and Finney Counties, Kansas. AMGAS will join with three other partners (collectively the “AMGAS JV”), pursuant to the Participation Agreement, to explore for and develop oil and gas and brine reserves on the property covered by the Farmout Agreement. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to begin in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets, including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing. In addition, the Farmout Agreement provides the AMGAS JV with rights to take in-kind and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant, located in Grant County, Kansas, which will enable the AMGAS JV to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices.
 
The AMGAS JV also acquired the right to all brine minerals, subject to a ten percent (10%) royalty to Scout, across Finney and Haskell Counties. Brine minerals are harvested from the formation water produced from active, and to be drilled, oil and gas wells and may include a variety of dissolved minerals, including bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV plans to target brine minerals with commercial quantities of bromine and iodine. The AMGAS JV is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells. The Farmout Agreement covers drilling and completion of up to 50 wells, with the first exploratory well scheduled to be spudded in April 2022. The AMGAS JV will utilize Scout’s existing infrastructure assets including water disposal, gas gathering and helium processing as part of the Farmout Agreement. The Farmout Agreement provides our JV with rights to take in-kind, and market its share of helium at the tailgate of Jayhawk Gas Plant. AMGAS JV will be able to market and sell the helium produced at prevailing market prices by taking its helium in-kind.

AMGAS, pursuant to the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement (as defined below), is currently developing proprietary technology to recover brine minerals, particularly with respect to bromine, which is well underway and has demonstrated recovery efficiency and is expected to be available for use in existing and future development wells.
 
The first exploratory well is scheduled to commence in April 2022 near Garden City, Kansas with a goal to evaluate the first of two separate silty shale members of the Chase group of formations – the Gage Shale and the Holmesville Shale. These two shale members have not previously been targeted for exploration by historical operations in the field.
 
The exploration and development activities will be directed and coordinated under the terms of the USNG Letter Agreement (as defined below) entered in November 2021 with input from the Board of Advisors (as defined below).
