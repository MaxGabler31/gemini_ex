ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
The Company owns proprietary carbon fiber based (Carbon Fiber Velvet or “CFV”) thermal management solutions that it believes are more effective at conducting, dissipating and storing heat generated by an electronic system’s internal components (i.e. semiconductor, integrated circuits “chips”) in comparison to traditional materials, such as copper and aluminum. KULR’s technologies can be applied inside a wide array of electronic applications where heat is often a problem, such as mobile devices, cloud computing, virtual reality platforms, satellites, internet of things, drones, and connected cars.
Thermal Management Solutions 
 
Three key vectors have driven advancements in semiconductors and electronics systems – performance, power, and size. These vectors, however, often counteract one another. As chip performance increases, power consumption increases, and more heat is generated as a byproduct. When chip size reduces, there is an increased potential for a hot spot on the chip, which can degrade system performance. Electronic system components must operate within a specific temperature range on both the high and low end to operate properly. KULR resolves many of the tradeoffs associated with other thermal management materials. KULR’s products improve heat storage and dissipation, rigidity problems and durability. Its products are lightweight and reduce manufacturing complexity associated with traditional thermal management materials.
 
In addition to thermal management of electronic systems, KULR has developed, in partnership with NASA Johnson Space Center (NASA JSC), a highly effective, lightweight and passive thermal protection technology. Thermal Runaway Shield (TRS) for lithium-ion batteries. KULR’s lithium-ion battery (Li-B) TRS product prevents a potentially dangerous combustible condition known as thermal runaway propagation from occurring in neighboring Li-B cells by acting as a shield or barrier in between individual Li-B cells in a battery pack. Although rare, incidents of thermal runaway propagation occurring spontaneously in Li-B cargo shipments and inside electronics, including hoverboards, smartphones, and electric vehicles, are a cause of public concern.
 
Corporate History
 
KT High-Tech was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015 and was formerly known as Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation. In April 2016, KT High-Tech implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the shareholders of KT High-Tech and its board of directors unanimously approved a name change from Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation to KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc. in April 2016. Prior to the Reverse Acquisition discussed below, KT High-Tech was an early-stage company planning to market and distribute technology products and components targeting the energy and consumer electronics industries. KT High-Tech intended to market and sell the products to both the end user and supply chain markets and to seek partnerships in developing and distributing such products.
 
KULR was formed in 2013 and is based in Santa Clara, California. Since its inception, KULR primarily focused on developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies, which it acquired through assignment from and license with KULR’s co-founder Dr. Timothy Knowles, in the high value, high-performance consumer electronic and energy storage applications. Prior to 2013, KULR’s technologies were used in numerous advanced space and industrial applications for NASA, Boeing, and Raytheon. A few notable achievements were the use of KULR’s technologies in X-31 Battery Heat Sink, Mercury Messenger (battery heat sink), and X-51 Scramjet (heat exchanger).
 
On June 19, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), KT High-Tech closed a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with KULR and 100% of the shareholders of KULR (the “KULR Shareholders”) whereby the KULR Shareholders agreed to transfer an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of KULR’s common stock to the Company in exchange for the Company’s issuance of an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the KULR Shareholders (the “Share Exchange”). On the Closing Date, KULR became a wholly-owned subsidiary of KT High-Tech, the KULR Stockholders beneficially owned approximately 64.57% of KT High-Tech’s common stock on a fully-diluted basis, and KT High-Tech began operating KULR’s business of developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies.
 
The closing of the Share Exchange Agreement was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, with KULR being treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this Annual Report reflect the assets, liabilities and historical results of KULR prior to the completion of the Share Exchange.

Market Opportunity and Strategy
 
Market 
 
The world of electronics continues to become more and more demanding and performance driven. The increasing demand for reliability of microelectronics and lithium-ion batteries has pushed thermal management to the forefront of many industries. We target our solutions to serve four application markets: electric transportation, mobile computing, cloud computing, and space exploration and communications.
 
According to a BCC Research, in 2016, the global thermal management market will grow from $11.2 billion in 2016 to $14.6 billion by the year 2021. According to the report, in recent years, electronics devices and systems have undergone tremendous technological growth. Advancements in the electronics industry have led to an increased need for innovative thermal management technologies, which serve to improve performance and reliability. The report states that technological progress has come on two fronts: increased functionality on a single device unit and miniaturization of each unit. As a result, there has been an increased demand for thermal management technologies. The report analyzes the thermal market by four segments, including hardware, software, interfaces, and substrates.
 
Electrical Transportation Market. The electrical transportation market includes electrical vehicles (EV), electrical planes, e-bikes, electrical motorcycles, electrical boats and other forms of transportations that are in transition from combustion engines to battery powered electric motors. Increasing global concerns regarding the negative effect of climate change along with alarming pollution levels recorded in major cities have created a demand for electric vehicles. A major factor behind the growth of electric vehicles is the support provided by various governmental agencies to encourage the sale of these vehicles. Several countries have pledged to ban the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles within the next two decades, with others expected to follow. 
Mobile Computing Market. The next generation mobile computing platform, also known as the “5G” mobile wireless standard, presents new challenges and demands to improve the performance and reliability of mobile infrastructures and consumer devices. According to the IHS Markit’s global study, in 2035, when 5G’s full economic benefit should be realized across the globe, a broad range of industries – from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and everything in between – could produce up to $12.3 trillion worth of goods and services enabled by 5G. The 5G value chain itself is seen as generating up to $3.5 trillion in revenue in 2035, supporting as many as 22 million jobs.
Cloud Computing Market. Market analysts at Forrester Research project the cloud computing market to be $178 billion in 2018, up from $146 billion in 2017 with sustained growth at a 22% annually. Forrester also predicts that more than 50% of global enterprises will rely on at least one public cloud platform. A key area of cloud computing is optical data transfer and communications connections and lines. Optical data is faster and more efficient and, as cloud computing banks move to acquire and utilize optical data, thermal management will play a pivotal role in maintaining the peak performance and safety of these expensive and highly sensitive computer connections. The processing demands of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology in the cloud requires advanced thermal management solutions for processors and memory modules.
Space Exploration and Communications Market. According to the Space Foundation, in 2016, the global space economy totaled $329 billion worldwide and commercial space activities comprised more than 75% of that spending. The overall trend in space investment is stable financially but explosive numerically, providing vastly more opportunity for space technology providers. Increasingly, investments in space exploration and commercialization are being led by well-funded private companies with most focused-on satellite development and deployment. KULR’s heritage in space thermal management technology positions us well in this market.
 
We believe KULR’s technology solution excels in a number of categories important in the world of thermal management. KULR’s proprietary carbon fiber-based solutions are generally more thermally conductive, lighter weight, require less contact pressure, and offer greater design flexibility and durability compared to traditional solutions. As a result, we believe KULR has real potential to offer a unique value proposition to customers in the multibillion-dollar thermal management industry. KULR aims to provide cost-effective, superior thermal management solutions for a group of electronic manufacturers.

For a traditionally conservative thermal and battery industry the company is aiming to exploit potentially disruptive approaches to the way it markets its products. Key to this approach is the creation of an ecosystem that adds broader value to the company’s products for its customers. In addition, the company will generate leads and raise its profile through the attendance at Industrial Conferences, use of press and social media and other channels.
 
Sales Strategy
 
The Company plans to market and sell KULR thermal management products (component products) and finished end-products (OEM products) that the Company develops with its partners into its sales and distribution channels. For the component products, the Company will market directly to its customers and utilize distributor partners and agents in Japan, China and EU countries. For its OEM products, the Company will sell into distributor channels primarily as a B2B business.
Advertising and Communications Strategy
 
We plan to utilize all forms of advertising and communications tools at our disposal. This includes commissioning unbiased white papers and technical papers, attending, sponsoring, and guest speaking at industry events, conferences, and symposiums. We have hired a public relations consultant who will oversee our press releases and media relations interface with newspapers, magazines, and blogs. We have also hired a SEO specialist for social media outreach activities and will also rely on the company’s pedigree within the thermal management community to spread high praise via word of mouth. To date, as a result of these efforts, we have been mentioned in WSJ, Cheddar TV, CNBC, Forbes, EETimes, USA Today, Business Insider and others.
Intellectual Property and Patent Strategy
 
Our intellectual property strategy includes pursing patent protection for new innovations in core carbon fiber architecture development, application development, acquisition of intellectual property, and licensing of third party patents and intellectual property.  As of April 11, 2018, we have seven pending nonprovisional and provisional patent applications and we have four patents granted and assigned to KULR. We also have an exclusive license to four third party patents. 
Product and Services
 
Our products can be divided into the following categories, subcategories and functionalities:
 
Lithium-Ion Battery (Li-B) Thermal Runaway Shield: KULR has developed a vaporizing heatsink aimed at passive resistance to thermal runaway propagation in lithium-ion batteries in partnership with NASA JSC. The heatsink shield designed for NASA JSC is a novel configuration, thin and lightweight, for use in conjunction with 18650 cells. The heatsink shield has proven to keep neighboring cells safe from thermal runaway propagation after a trigger cell was intentionally overheated. This lightweight solution can be used in energy storage and industrial and consumer electronics applications that require a lightweight and passive solution for battery safety.
Fiber Thermal Interface Material (FTI): KULR thermal interface materials (TIMs) consist of vertically oriented carbon fiber velvets attached to a film of polymer or metal. The fiber packing density and orientation are selected to serve a wide range of applications, including hostile thermal and chemical environments, sliding interfaces, and interfaces with widely varying gaps. They can be coated for electrical isolation. They require low contact pressure and provide high thermal conductivity. Their light weight and high compliance make them uniquely suited for aerospace, industrial and high performance commercial devices.

Phase Change Material (PCM) Heat Sink: KULR phase change material (PCM) composite heat sinks consisting of a conductive carbon fiber velvet embedded with a suitable alkane (“paraffin”) having high latent heat at its melting point.  Such heat sinks offer passive thermal control for instruments that would otherwise overheat or under-cool during periodic operations. A typical application involves lasers that dissipate heat but need tight thermal control where active cooling is unavailable. 
 
Internal Short Circuit (ISC) Device: In March 2018, KULR reached an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, to be the exclusive manufacturing and distribution partner for the patented Internal Short Circuit (ISC) device, which causes predictable battery cell failures in lithium-ion batteries, making them easier to study and, therefore, safer. Lithium-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power; billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. They provide power for everything from smart phones and laptops to electric cars and space crafts. But lithium-ion batteries fail, sometimes with catastrophic results. Due to the relative rarity of cell failures, scientists and researchers had been unable to reliably or accurately replicate latent defect cell failures in lab settings, impeding research into safer battery technology. In 2015, researchers at NREL and NASA developed and patented a device – the Internal Short Circuit – that creates these cell failures in predictable conditions. KULR will market both ISC devices to battery cell manufacturers and ISC embedded battery cells to OEM manufacturers.
Recent Developments
 
In June 2017, two PCM heat sinks from KULR were part of NASA’s Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, which was launched into space aboard SpaceX-11 ISS Commercial Resupply Services Flight. NICER was installed on the space station later that month. One heat sink was for the Instrument Deck and the other for the Avionics Deck. The purpose of the PCM heat sinks are to keep the overall NICER instruments from getting too cold while disconnected from power during transfer from the launch vehicle to its location of operation on ISS. The transfer could take up to six hours.
 
In December 2017, we shipped six PCM heat sinks to NASA JPL for the 2020 Mars Rover program. The purpose of the heatsinks is to keep the detector from getting too cold during operations on Mars. 
 
In January 2018, we entered into a Product Development Agreement with a top automotive manufacturer to develop a TRS-based solution for their electrical vehicle battery packs. The agreement is milestone-based and while there is no guarantee that KULR TRS products will ever be integrated into our strategic partner’s vehicles, we continue to advance the milestones. 
 
In March 2018, we entered into an agreement with the NREL granting us an exclusive license to commercialize its patented Internal Short Circuit technology. This technology was jointly developed by NREL and NASA to provide a reliable testing method for lithium-ion battery safety.
 
Competition
 
Currently, the battery industry uses a number of solutions to mitigate thermal runaway propagation which solutions are offered by Unifrax, Lydall, Outlast, 3M, Engineered Syntactic Systems, Celono, AllCell and others. Each of their solutions offer unique features and benefits for a specific application. We do not believe, however, that there has been a one size fit all solution across all applications. We believe our TRS solution offers competitive light-weight and effective solutions for high energy battery cells because it is more flexible and can fit into different design configurations. For applications that require passive, light-weight solutions for high energy density battery cells, TRS offers a competitive solution.
 
Thermal interface material is a large and fragmented market with many large suppliers including: Henkel Bergquist, Fujipoly, Laird, 3M, Honeywell and others. These solutions are typically based on silicone and thermal particles. KULR’s FTI offers high bulk thermal conductivity and low contact pressure requirements, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other thermal interface solutions.
 
Our licensed ISC device offers a reliable way to trigger battery cell thermal runaway compared to nail penetration, over-charging or over-heating the cell. ISC does not rely on mechanically damaging the battery exterior to activate the short, as do most of the other evaluation methodologies. Instead, the ISC devices trigger true internal shorts. This makes it possible to accurately pinpoint and fix problems leading to malfunctions, an ability that we believe will give us a competitive advantage over other testing solutions.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance
 
Certain substances we use in our manufacturing process are subject to federal governmental regulations (such as EPA regulations). We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, and that the cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws is not material. As a small generator of hazardous substances, we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances, such as acetone that is used in very small quantities to manufacture our products. We are currently in compliance with these regulations. Most new materials sold in the U.S or in many other countries require regulation by government authorities. In most other countries, there are no specific regulations that require additional regulation, but some countries do have registration requirements with which we comply to the best our ability.
Employees
 
As of April 11, 2018, we had 12 employees and 6 consultants.
 
We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
