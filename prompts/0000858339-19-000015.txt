ITEM 1. | Business

Overview 
Caesars Entertainment is a casino-entertainment and hospitality services provider with the world’s most diversified portfolio. We have established a rich history of industry-leading growth and expansion since we commenced operations in 1937. Our facilities typically include gaming offerings, food and beverage outlets, hotel and convention space, and non-gaming entertainment options. In addition to our brick and mortar assets, we operate an online gaming business that provides real money games in certain jurisdictions and offers retail sports wagering in certain jurisdictions.
CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. CEC operates the business primarily through its wholly owned subsidiaries CEOC, LLC (“CEOC LLC”) and Caesars Resort Collection, LLC (“CRC”).
We lease certain real property assets from VICI Properties Inc. and/or its subsidiaries (collectively, “VICI”).
Significant Transactions in 2018
New Transactions with VICI
Harrah’s Philadelphia Real Estate Sale and Leaseback 
On December 26, 2018, we sold all land and real property improvements used in the operation of Harrah’s Philadelphia Casino and Racetrack (“Harrah’s Philadelphia”) as part of a sale and leaseback transaction with VICI for $242 million. We continue to operate Harrah’s Philadelphia under the terms of a long-term lease agreement relating to certain of our other domestic properties. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
Modifications to Lease Agreements with VICI
In connection with the Octavius Tower sale discussed below and the Harrah’s Philadelphia transaction discussed above, on December 26, 2018, the Company and VICI consummated modifications to certain of our existing lease agreements for consideration of $159 million to VICI, which reduced our financing obligation. The modifications, among other things, bring certain of the lease terms into alignment with other master leases in the sector and the long-term performance of the properties and create additional flexibility to facilitate our future development strategies. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
Sale of Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace
On July 11, 2018, we sold Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace (“Octavius Tower”) to VICI for $508 million in cash. Proceeds from the transaction were used to partially fund the closing of CEC’s acquisition of Centaur Holdings, LLC (“Centaur”). We continue to operate the Octavius Tower under the current terms of the long-term lease agreement with VICI relating to Caesars Palace. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.
Acquisition of Centaur Holdings, LLC
On July 16, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Centaur. Centaur operated Hoosier Park Racing & Casino in Anderson, Indiana, and Indiana Grand Racing & Casino in Shelbyville, Indiana. See Note 4 for additional information.
Other Significant Transactions and Significant Events
CEO Transition
On November 1, 2018, we announced that Mark P. Frissora, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will leave the Company. Subject to the terms of the separation agreement entered into between the Company and Mr. Frissora (as amended, the “Separation Agreement”), Mr. Frissora will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer until a termination date of April 30, 2019 (which the Company may extend by one month) for purposes of continuity of leadership as the Company searches for a successor to Mr. Frissora with the nationally recognized third-party search firm the Company has engaged for that purpose.
CEOC’s Emergence from Bankruptcy and CEC’s Merger with Caesars Acquisition Company
Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (“CEOC”) and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) voluntarily filed for reorganization on January 15, 2015 (the “Petition Date”), at which time CEC deconsolidated CEOC. The Debtors emerged from bankruptcy and consummated their reorganization pursuant to their third amended joint plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) on October 6, 2017 (the “Effective Date”). As part of its emergence from bankruptcy, CEOC reorganized into an operating company (“OpCo”) separate from its real property assets (“PropCo”). OpCo was acquired by CEC on the Effective Date and immediately merged with and into CEOC LLC. See Note 4 for additional information. CEOC LLC operates the properties and facilities formerly held by CEOC and leases the properties and facilities from VICI.
On the Effective Date, Caesars Acquisition Company (“CAC”) merged with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the “CAC Merger”). See Note 4 for additional information. The CAC Merger was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common control, which resulted in CAC being consolidated into Caesars at book value as an equity transaction for all periods presented.
Hamlet Holdings 
The members of Hamlet Holdings LLC (“Hamlet Holdings”) are comprised of affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC and affiliates of TPG Global, LLC. Hamlet Holdings contributed to CEC the 88 million shares of CEC common stock it owned prior to the CAC Merger, which CEC immediately canceled and retired. Hamlet Holdings controlled CEC prior to the CAC Merger. Upon completion of the CAC Merger and CEOC’s emergence from bankruptcy, due to reductions in ownership percentage of the Company starting on the Effective Date, Hamlet Holdings no longer controls CEC.
CRC Merger
CRC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC, was created on December 22, 2017, with the merger of Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC (“CERP”) into Caesars Growth Properties Holdings, LLC (“CGPH”).
Organizational Structure
As of December 31, 2018, through our consolidated entities, we have a total of 53 properties, three of which do not have casinos, in 14 U.S. states and five countries outside of the U.S. Our facilities have an aggregate of over 3 million square feet of gaming space and approximately 40,000 hotel rooms. Of the 50 casinos, 37 are in the United States and primarily consist of land-based and riverboat or dockside casinos. Our 13 international casinos are land-based casinos, most of which are located in the United Kingdom.
We view each property as an operating segment and aggregate them into three regionally-focused reportable segments: (i) Las Vegas, (ii) Other U.S., and (iii) All Other, which is consistent with how we manage the business. Within these segments, our properties are primarily categorized as Leased (where we lease real property assets from VICI), Owned-Domestic, Owned-International, and Managed. See Item 2, “Properties,” for more information about our properties.
Our All Other segment includes managed and international properties as well as other businesses, such as Caesars Interactive Entertainment (“CIE”).
Business Operations
Our consolidated business is composed of five complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino entertainment, food and beverage, rooms and hotel, casino management services, and entertainment and other business operations, including mobile sports betting. Upon CEOC’s emergence from bankruptcy on the Effective Date, the majority of its real property assets were sold to VICI and simultaneously leased back to us as part of the plan of reorganization. Additional transactions with VICI were subsequently completed to finance acquisitions, resulting in cash proceeds and corresponding financing obligations. See Note 1 and Note 10 for additional information.

Casino Entertainment Operations
Our casino entertainment operations generate revenues from approximately 39,000 slot machines and 2,700 table games, as well as other games such as keno, poker, and race and sports books, all of which comprised approximately 51% of our total net revenues in 2018. Slot revenues generate the majority of our gaming revenues, particularly in our properties located outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.
Food and Beverage Operations
Our food and beverage operations generate revenues from over 180 buffets, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos, as well as banquets and room service, and represented approximately 19% of our total net revenues in 2018. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants and buffets.
Rooms and Hotel Operations
Rooms and hotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 36,000 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2018. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.
We have engaged in large capital reinvestment projects in recent years focusing primarily on our room product across the United States, including renovating over 14,000 rooms in Las Vegas since 2015 at properties such as Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino (“Planet Hollywood”), Flamingo Las Vegas, Bally’s Las Vegas, Harrah’s Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas. In addition, we continue to roll out self-check-in kiosks in order to help reduce customer wait times and improve labor efficiencies.
Management Services
We earn revenue from fees paid for the management of eight casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where Caesars Entertainment provides staffing and management services under management agreements. In 2018, we opened our first non-gaming properties, a Caesars and Caesars Palace, which are managed by us, including two beachfront luxury resorts, a beach club, and a residential tower on Meraas’ Bluewaters Island in Dubai.
Entertainment and Other Business Operations
We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood, both of which were ranked among the top theater venues in the United States in 2018 based on ticket sales. These award-winning theaters have hosted prominent headliners, such as Celine Dion, Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani, and the Backstreet Boys.
The LINQ Promenade and our retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. The LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, and it features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel. On November 9, 2018, we opened Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip.
On July 16, 2018, we broke ground on CAESARS FORUM, a 550,000 square-foot conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. Scheduled to officially open in 2020, CAESARS FORUM will feature 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, and FORUM Plaza, the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in Las Vegas.
In addition, CIE operates a regulated online real money gaming business in Nevada and New Jersey and owns the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) tournaments and brand, and also licenses WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and businesses related to this brand.
The Company is now live with retail sports wagering across three U.S. jurisdictions, including launching in Pennsylvania in January 2019 to bring our total to four states. In September 2018, the Company also launched The Caesars Casino & Sports app for mobile sports betting which allows players in New Jersey who download the app to place bets on sporting events. They can also play over 400 casino games including slots, table games, and video poker. This product is expected to be launched in Pennsylvania in March 2019 pending regulatory approval and will launch in other states as regulatory approval is received. 
The Company continues to solidify local and national partnerships that align our casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. During 2018, we had several developments in our strategy to raise Caesars’ profile among professional sports fans. We announced high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever “Official Casino Sponsor” in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL’s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to Caesars patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks in the U.S. and U.K. to promote our properties, also enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. Furthermore, Caesars will host brand activations at prominent, high-profile NFL events, including the NFL Draft, NFL playoffs, and the Super Bowl.
Sales and Marketing
On January 30, 2019, Caesars announced the rebranding of Total Rewards, the Company’s industry-leading loyalty program, to Caesars Rewards effective February 1, 2019. The new program leverages the premium Caesars brand to better connect Caesars’ elevated standard and prestige with the Company’s global destinations.
We are excited about this opportunity to strengthen our unrivaled customer loyalty program. We believe Caesars Rewards enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross market strategy. We believe that operating multiple properties in the center of the Las Vegas Strip generates greater revenues than would be generated if the properties were operated separately.
Members who have joined Caesars Rewards can earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activity and qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and now Dubai. Members can also earn additional Reward Credits when they use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits with Caesars for hotel amenities, casino free play and other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel.
Caesars Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their Tier Level, their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, copyright, or combination of several of our intellectual property rights, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate, including United States and foreign patent applications covering certain proprietary technology of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC (“CES”). We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. CES’ United States patents have varying expiration dates.
We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.
We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Bally’s, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris, Rio, Caesars Rewards, WSOP, and a license for the Planet Hollywood trademark used in connection with the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.
Competition
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition has increased significantly. For example, the Genting Group is developing a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, and Marriott International and New York-based global real estate firm Witkoff 
are developing a casino and hotel called The Drew Las Vegas. Both are expected to open in 2020 on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. In May 2018, MGM rebranded the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino as Park MGM, which underwent non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage, and entertainment enhancements. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other.
In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. For example, in Baltimore, Maryland, the opening of MGM Resorts National Harbor Resort & Casino has resulted in significant declines in revenue at our Horseshoe Baltimore property. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues. Atlantic City, in particular, has seen a significant decline primarily due to the addition of gaming and room capacity associated with the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania as well as the opening of new properties. This has resulted in several casino closings in recent years. In addition, Hard Rock Hotel Atlantic City and Ocean Resort Casino were introduced into the Atlantic City market in 2018, causing increased competition in the market.
Our properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers.
We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. While we do not believe it to be the case, some have suggested that internet gaming could also create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our brick-and-mortar operations. We believe that internet gaming complements brick-and-mortar operations.
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K. 
Seasonality
We believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently.
Governmental Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K.
Our businesses are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional discussion.
Employee Relations
We have approximately 66,000 employees throughout our organization. Approximately 28,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries relating to certain casino, hotel, and restaurant employees. The majority of these employees are covered by the following agreements:

Employee Group | Approximate Number of Active Employees Represented | Union | Date on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable
Las Vegas Culinary Employees | 12,900 | Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 | May 31, 2023 
Atlantic City Food & Beverage and Hotel Employees | 3,200 | UNITE HERE, Local 54 | February 28, 2020 
Las Vegas Bartenders | 1,300 | Bartenders Union, Local 165 | May 31, 2023 
Las Vegas Dealers | 2,400 | Transport Workers Union of America and UAW | Various up toSeptember 30, 2019 

Corporate Social Responsibility, Citizenship and Sustainability
CEC’s Board of Directors and senior executives view Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) as an integral element in the way we do business and make decisions, in the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the company against risk, contributes to improved business results and helps foster positive relationships with all those who have a connection to our business. The Board of Directors and our executive management are committed to maintaining our position as an industry leader in CSR (which includes the concepts of corporate citizenship, social impact, and environmental sustainability). In 2018, we continued to engage with our CEO-level external sustainability advisory board with experts representing non-governmental organizations, business strategy, academia, and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our citizenship priorities. These priorities are reflected in our ninth annual citizenship report, published in 2018 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards. 
Our approach, and our reporting on corporate social responsibility, is aligned with our People Planet Play framework. This framework unites all our properties and business activities behind a common language and core approaches so that all our properties and corporate functions can effectively support sustainable, ethical and profitable business growth. The framework is as follows:

• | People: supporting the wellbeing of our team members, guests and local communities.


• | Planet: taking care of the world we all call home.


• | Play: creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading Responsible Gaming practices in the industry.

Our strategy includes targets to 2020 and 2030 across all elements of People Planet Play, including science-based emissions-reduction targets, formally approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) and aligning with global best practices on climate change action. We enjoy strong support from our team members for People Planet Play activities, with 57% of team members participating in our HERO volunteering and/or CodeGreen environmental programs in 2017. Additionally, we aim to raise awareness and gain support from our guests for People Planet Play initiatives. In 2018, guest perception was that 56% strongly agreed that our company made a positive impact in economic development, responsible gaming, environmental impact and overall responsible conduct based on surveys completed by guests at our properties.
Code of Commitment
Our Code of Commitment to our employees, guests, communities and the environment continues to guide our approach to responsible and ethical business, compliance, anti-corruption and environmental stewardship. Our employees participate in training to reinforce their understanding of how they should implement the Code of Commitment in their daily work. Thirty years ago, Caesars was the first company to develop Responsible Gaming programs informed by science, evaluated objectively and created in conjunction with leading researchers. Our gaming offerings are underpinned by comprehensive Responsible Gaming programs that provide advice for those who need it (see more on our website: www.caesars.com/corporate/corporate-social-responsibility/play/responsible-gaming) with fully trained team members. In 2017, team members participated in 71,366 hours of training in Responsible Gaming.
Over the past several years, with the engagement and support of the Board of Directors, we have further intensified our anti-money-laundering (“AML”) compliance activities. We reinforced the number of qualified staff in dedicated AML compliance roles with more than 90 experts and have invested several million dollars in technology investments to implement new systems to improve 
transparency and information sharing within the Company, increase automation and enhance analytics, all to further the Company’s efforts to be an industry leader in AML compliance.
For the fourth year running, we were recognized by the Civic 50, an initiative organized by Points of Light and Bloomberg that recognizes companies that demonstrate leading commitment to improving the quality of life in their home communities. In 2017, we reconfirmed our support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and highlighted three goals where we can make the most significant contribution and expand our impact in coming years.

• | #3: Good Health and Well-Being


• | #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth


• | #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

Environmental Stewardship
Our structured, data-driven CodeGreen strategy leverages the passion of our team members and engages our guests and suppliers. 
In 2017, we received formal approval from the SBTi for targets that place us among a small number of companies that are leading the way on climate change mitigation. We committed to: (i) reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2025, and 95% by 2050 from a 2011 base-year and (ii) having 60% of suppliers by spend institute science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets for their operations by 2023. Between 2011 and 2017, we reduced greenhouse gas emissions internationally by 23% on an absolute basis and by 27% on a per square-foot basis, building on the significant achievements of our CodeGreen strategy from 2007. Since 2008, we have reduced water consumption by 22% on a per square foot basis. In 2017, 41% of our total waste in North America was diverted from landfill, bringing our cumulative waste diversion from landfill to 328,000 tons since 2012.
In 2017, 100% of our owned or managed North American hotel resort properties achieved a 4 Green Key rating or higher. Recently recognized by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Green Key is a rigorous program that ranks, certifies and inspects hotels and resorts based on their commitment to sustainable operations. Green Key uses a rating system of 1 to 5 Keys, with 5 being the highest possible attainment.
For our work in disclosure of our environmental impacts, in 2018, Caesars Entertainment received an “A” score in supplier engagement, an “A-” score for climate, and a “B” score in water from the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”), an international not-for-profit that drives sustainable economies. Caesars was recently recognized as a world leader for Supplier Engagement on climate change. For the first time, we ranked among the 3% of organizations to be awarded a position on the Supplier Engagement Leader Board for actions to reduce emissions and lower climate-related risks in the supply chain in the past reporting year. Thousands of companies submit annual disclosures to CDP for independent assessment against its scoring methodology.
In order to both enhance our offerings and engage guests in our citizenship efforts, we have branded our hotel rooms with our People Planet Play messaging, inviting guests to play a role by using water, air-conditioning and towels with the environment in mind. We promote sustainable sourcing of key food ingredients for our menus from sustainably managed farms and fisheries, in response to the growing number of consumers who value such options. Additionally, to address concerns from animal rights groups, we have committed to source cage-free eggs across all our properties by 2025.
Employee Engagement, Development, Safety and Wellbeing
We aim to inspire our team members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment. We nurture an open, collaborative and fun workplace where everyone can be their best. We provide opportunities for personal development and reward our team members with competitive compensation and the opportunity to earn substantial rewards based on merit. Our Total Return program for team members acknowledges great service, earning more than $9 million in 2018 for team members that they can redeem for merchandise, travel, entertainment, event tickets, and digital media. We survey our team members each year and, in 2018, we again achieved an improved engagement score of 4.22, higher than the Willis Towers Watson benchmark of 4.20 in the same year. This correlates to improvements in customer service, which in 2018 reached an all-time high, while our Net Promoter Scores also increased. In addition, we invest significantly in training and development of our team members.
Caesars Entertainment is committed to creating a safe workplace for our employees and a safe venue for our guests. We strive for zero injuries every day at every property. Our company-wide initiative launched in 2015, “All in for Zero”, continues to embed standards and procedures to ensure all our colleagues have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit. We publicly report on our safety performance annually (Injury Rate of 2.74 per 100 employees in 2017). We also strive to help our team members look after their health and wellbeing through our Employee Wellness Rewards Program that is supported by 29
nurses and coaches across our properties. The program has demonstrated results with improved health metrics for participating employees and their spouses, which has helped to mitigate insurance cost increases for Caesars and for employees.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive working environment that welcomes and celebrates all our team members as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion position directly connects to our endorsement of human rights for all as provided in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international frameworks. In 2017, we formalized a diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) framework that identifies five pillars of activity, each headed by a senior executive sponsor. The pillars include advocacy, workplace, suppliers, communities and guests (through marketing offerings) for a holistic approach to embedding DEI in everything we do. Caesars received a perfect 100% score on the 2018 Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index for the eleventh year in a row. In 2017, 32% of our manager level employees belonged to minority groups and 42% were women. In November 2017, we announced our goal to achieve gender equity in leadership by 2025. This initiative embodies Caesars’ commitment to identifying, hiring, developing, and retaining talented people. This will enable our organization to be best in class, be more innovative, make better decisions, and better reflect our diverse clients and communities.
We also promote diversity in our supply chain and in 2017, approximately 17% of our addressable spend was with diverse suppliers. We maintain extensive outreach to discover diverse suppliers and support diverse suppliers through mentoring programs to gain business and grow with Caesars. 
Human Trafficking
We take a strong stance against human trafficking and commercial sex exploitation, as can be seen in our public statement on our website. Under the guidance of a respected and accomplished leader in treating victims of exploitation, Dr. Halleh Seddighzadeh, we created an internal protocol supported by a suite of educational materials including a dedicated online portal for team members, a “Combating Human Trafficking Toolkit” and action guides. We trained customer-facing and security team members across our Las Vegas properties and have appointed 120 volunteer Community Engagement Ambassadors (“CEAs”) as leaders in addressing sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation on property. We rolled out a train-the-trainers program for CEAs who continue to educate other team members. We continue to work in the context of an industry-wide partnership in an effort to eliminate all forms of exploitation from our operations and our supply chain. 
Community Investment
Caesars Entertainment consistently makes significant contributions to our local communities to help them develop and prosper. We do this through funding of community projects, employee volunteering hours and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded by a portion of our operating income that has gifted more than $74 million since its inception in 2002. In 2017, we contributed a total of $63 million to communities through all these channels, including 331,000 reported employee volunteer hours.
In the last year, we have advanced in partnership with the City of Las Vegas and its ImpactNV initiative, a sustainable development approach in Southern Nevada. Through several multi-partner and multi-sector workshops designed to identify intersections of major social challenges facing the city, we have developed a social sustainability master plan blueprint with long-term goals in the areas of reducing homelessness, combating sex trafficking and improving the health of immigrant communities. We continue to commit resources to addressing these pressing social challenges.
