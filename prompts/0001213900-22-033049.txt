ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
THE COMPANY



Better For You Wellness, Inc. (we, us, our, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) was originally incorporated with the name Fast Track Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on December 1, 2020. We are a sustainable brands and services company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. We are evaluating opportunities targeting six goals-based wellness categories within the rapidly growing wellness industry to create a leading global wellness conglomerate.



The Company’s current business plan is to explore and evaluate various opportunities in the plant-based food and beverage and consumer packaged goods sectors, including but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, or business combination transactions. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.



The Company’s head office is located at 1349 East Broad Street, Columbus, OH 43205.



Business Overview



Through our dual buy and build business model, we evaluate the wellness industry in the following six goals-based categories:




● | Better Health 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Better Fitness 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Better Nutrition 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Better Appearance 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Better Sleep 
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Better Mindfulness 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------




Our strategy is designed to offer wellness consumers a diverse synergistic portfolio of brands and products that will allow them to live a life of intention and improve their quality of life.



We believe wellness consumers purchase with intention and specifically seek out the brands and products that improve their quality of life. Furthermore, we believe wellness consumers pursue these six goals-based dimensions of wellness and are positioning the Company to capitalize on this demand. With skin being humans’ largest organ, we have initially prioritized skincare and haircare to help wellness consumers look and feel better with clean and natural products. We intend to expand into additional wellness categories with functional foods, beverages, supplements, and more.



Our management team brings deep expertise in heavily regulated industries, operating, brand identity, genetics, and services, and raising capital to the public market. We seek synergistic and complementary mergers and acquisition opportunities, implementing operational efficiencies to eliminate duplicative measures and centralize administrative operations to achieve more significant revenues and profitability. Additionally, we expect to leverage our network of retail relationships, as well as acquire and manage brands and services cultivated in the beauty and wellness industry to secure sales in major retailers in the United States and globally.



Our management team monitors a variety of trends and factors that follow which could impact our operating performance.



Revenue Strategy



Our revenue growth strategy follows a dual buy and build model in which we acquire brands and related infrastructure, as well as develop brands and related infrastructure in-house. In addition to scaling the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Glow Market LLC, which currently owns and operates our Better Suds soap brand, we have executed multiple non-binding letters of intent to acquire companies within the skincare sector including a vertically-integrated skincare manufacturer and multiple brands. The closing of these respective transactions is dependent on numerous factors including but not limited to satisfactory completion of due diligence, capital constraints, and more. Furthermore, any of these contemplated transactions would likely have a material impact on the Company’s operating performance.
Market Opportunity



We aim to become a major participant in the $1.5 trillion global wellness industry. We believe our innovative wellness-related offerings converge with wellness consumer trends and demands for “Better-For-You” brands and products that can satisfy all pricing points. We expect consumer trends towards adoption of these healthier lifestyles to continue.
Competition



We will compete with companies that operate in the plant-based and science-focused wellness market. Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial resources, broader market presence, longer-standing relationships with distributors, retailers, and suppliers, longer operating histories, more extensive production and distribution capabilities, more robust brand recognition, more significant marketing resources, and more comprehensive product lines than us. We believe that principal competitive factors in this category include, among others, quality ingredients, wellness profile, cost, convenience, branding, and marketing.
Sales and Marketing Costs



As we continue to grow our “BFYW” product portfolio, we expect to expand our sales and marketing team by adding dedicated personnel to service additional retail customers. Outside sales representatives and brokers may be added to expand our sales efforts. We further envision engaging, developing and possibly acquiring a subscription box retail operation. Marketing expenditures are expected to begin primarily online and in product fees (as we engage retail store expansion), as well as other similar in-store marketing costs. These expenses will be categorized as net deductions to revenue under GAAP instead of marketing expenses. We plan to hire a national marketing firm to implement digital video and display campaigns, connected television, social media, and search engine marketing. As we expand and grow revenue, we will build a brand management team (to support Management, who oversees all “BFYW” marketing efforts) to focus on digital marketing, social media, and other marketing functions.
Operating Costs



Our operating costs include raw materials, labor and related benefits, manufacturing overhead, marketing, sales, distribution, shipping, and other general and administrative expenses. We manage the impact of our operating costs through select raw ingredient contracts with growers and material providers.
Fluctuations in Costs



Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs, and our productivity efforts. If we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects, sourcing decisions, and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, and net earnings. Sales can also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve, and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization, general overhead and workforce optimization, as well as outsourcing projects as deemed appropriate.
Commodities



In the future, our profitability could depend on our ability to anticipate and react to raw material costs, among other things. Raw materials can be sourced from various parts of the globe, and the prices of raw goods are subject to many factors beyond our control. These factors include variables in the farming businesses (including crop degradation due to adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and pestilence), the size and number of growers who produce crops, changes in national or world economic conditions, political events, tariffs, trade wars or other events.
Employees



At February 28, 2022, we employed 2 full-time employees, Mr. Ian James, who was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Stephen Letourneau, who was appointed as the Chief Branding Officer, and Director.
Acquisitions



The Company follows a dual buy and build business model for growth through acquisitions and in-house development of brands. We have executed multiple non-binding letters of intent to acquire companies within the skincare sector including a vertically-integrated skincare manufacturer and multiple brands. The closing of these respective transactions is dependent on numerous factors, including but not limited to satisfactory completion of due diligence, capital constraints, and more. Furthermore, any of these contemplated transactions would likely have a material impact on the Company’s operating performance.

Business of Issuer



The Company is an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”), that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC’s) reporting and disclosure rules (See Emerging Growth Companies Section Below).



The Company, based on proposed business activities, is a “blank check” company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51)-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person.” Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a shell company, because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.



The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.



The Company’s current business plan is to explore and evaluate various opportunities in the plant-based food and beverage and consumer packaged goods sectors (“Plant-based Businesses”), including but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, or business combination transactions. The Company’s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will restrict its potential candidate target companies to Plant-based Businesses, but will not restrict its potential target companies in terms of geographical location. The Company may merge with or acquire another company in which the promoters, management, or promoters’ or managements’ affiliates or associates, directly or indirectly, have an ownership interest.



The Company was a shell company prior to the Reorganization which occurred as a result of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, and Sauer Energy, Inc. was a private operating company. The reverse acquisition by a non-operating public shell company by a private operating company typically results in the owners and management of the private company having actual or effective voting and operating control of the combined company. Therefore, the reverse acquisition is considered a capital transaction in substance. In other words, the transaction is a reverse recapitalization, equivalent to the issuance of stock by the private company for the net monetary assets of the shell company accompanied by a recapitalization. Therefore, the acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization and Sauer Energy, Inc. is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of Sauer Energy, Inc. have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized.



Accordingly, the reverse acquisition has been treated as a corporate restructuring (reorganization) of entities under common control and thus the current capital structure of Sauer Energy, Inc. has been presented in prior periods as if such a structure existed at that time and in accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5.











As a result of the closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Company ceased to be a shell company. The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Mr. Ian James, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any other definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any other potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Registrant has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Registrant will consider the following kinds of factors:




(a) | Target is focused in the plant-based food and beverage and consumer packaged goods sectors; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 


(c) | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Registrant or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | The cost of participation by the Registrant as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(g) | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and, 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | Other relevant factors. 
----+----------------------------




In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Registrant’s limited capital available for investigation, the Registrant may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.



Additionally, Better For You Wellness, Inc. will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with and acquisitions of business entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies which may be a merger or acquisition candidate for Better For You Wellness, Inc. Nearly all such entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than Better For You Wellness, Inc. and, consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. Moreover, Better For You Wellness, Inc. will also compete with numerous other small public companies in seeking merger or acquisition candidates.



Security holders, who received securities from us when we became a shell company, are considered underwriters in connection with any resale of those securities until one year from the date the Company’s Form 10 information was publicly filed on March 23, 2021, as specified in Rule 144(i). Shares of our common stock which are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but are currently held by shareholders, cannot be sold under the exemptions from registration provided by Rule 144 under or Section 4(1) of the Securities Act (“Rule 144”) so long as the Company is designated a “shell company” and for 12 months after it ceases to be a “shell company,” provided the Company otherwise is in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. Compliance with the criteria for securing exemptions under federal securities laws and the securities laws of the various states is extremely complex, especially in respect of those exemptions affording flexibility and the elimination of trading restrictions in respect of securities received in exempt transactions and subsequently disposed of without registration under the Securities Act or state securities laws.











If the Company engages in a registration statement offering our securities for sale as a blank check company or with a company that would still be considered a shell company or blank check company, our securities will require registration subject to Rule 419. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a rule (Rule 419) which defines a blank check company as (i) a development stage company, that is (ii) offering penny stock, as defined by Rule 3a51-1, and (iii) that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies. Should we file a registration statement offering of our securities for sale before we complete a business combination with an operating company, the Company would be considered a blank check company within the meaning of Rule 419 and any sales of the stock issued in the offering would require a registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, furthermore, the registered securities and the proceeds from an offering subject to Rule 419 require the following:




a) | Deposit and investment of proceeds
---+-----------------------------------




All offering proceeds, after deduction of cash paid for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses and dealer allowances, and amounts permitted to be released to the registrant shall be deposited promptly into the escrow or trust account; provided, however, that no deduction may be made for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses or dealer allowances payable to an affiliate of the registrant.




b) | Deposit of securities
---+----------------------




All securities issued in connection with the offering, whether or not for cash consideration, and any other securities issued with respect to such securities, including securities issued with respect to stock splits, stock dividends, or similar rights, shall be deposited directly into the escrow or trust account promptly upon issuance. The identity of the purchaser of the securities shall be included on the stock certificates or other documents evidencing such securities.




c) | Release of deposited and funds securities
---+------------------------------------------




Post-effective amendment for acquisition agreement. Upon execution of an agreement(s) for the acquisition(s) of a business(es) or assets that will constitute the business (or a line of business) of the registrant and for which the fair value of the business(es) or net assets to be acquired represents at least 80 percent of the maximum offering proceeds, including proceeds received or to be received upon the exercise or conversion of any securities offered, but excluding amounts payable to non-affiliates for underwriting commissions, underwriting expenses, and dealer allowances, the registrant shall file a post-effective amendment disclosing the entire transaction.



Furthermore, if we publicly offer any securities as a condition to the closing of any acquisition or business combination while we are a blank check or shell company, we will have to fully comply with SEC Rule 419 and deposit all funds in escrow pending advice about the proposed transaction to our stockholders fully disclosing all information required by Regulation 14 of the SEC and seeking the vote and agreement of investment of those stockholders to whom such securities were offered; if no response is received from these stockholders within 45 days thereafter or if any stockholder elects not to invest following our advice about the proposed transaction, all funds that must be held in escrow by us under Rule 419, as applicable, will be promptly returned to any such stockholder. All securities issued in any such offering will likewise be deposited in escrow, pending satisfaction of the foregoing conditions. In addition, if we enter into a transaction with a company that would still be considered a shell company or blank check company, the exemption from registration available from Rule 144, for the resales of our securities by our shareholders, would not be available to us.



In addition, the ability to register or qualify for sale any shares of stock for both initial sale and secondary trading would be limited because a number of states have enacted regulations pursuant to their securities or “blue sky” laws restricting or, in some instances, prohibiting, the sale of securities of “blank check” issuers, such as the Company, within that state. In addition, many states, while not specifically prohibiting or restricting “blank check” companies, may not register the shares for sale in their states. Because of such regulations and other restrictions, the Company’s selling efforts, if any, and any secondary market which may develop, may only be conducted in those jurisdictions where an applicable exemption is available or a blue sky application has been filed and accepted or where the shares have been registered thus limiting the issuers ability to complete this offering. 











Corporate History 



Agreement & Plan of Merger



Better For You Wellness, Inc. (we, us, our, the “Company” or the “Registrant”), was originally incorporated with the name Fast Track Solutions, Inc. in the State of Nevada on December 1, 2020.



On January 28, 2021, as a result of an Application for Custodianship granted by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, styled as “In the matter of Sauer Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, Case Number: A-20-826848-P”, Jeffrey DeNunzio was appointed Custodian of Sauer Energy, Inc..



On April 26, 2021, the Company entered into an “Agreement and Plan of Merger”, whereas it agreed to, and subsequently participated in, a Nevada holding company reorganization pursuant to NRS 92A.180, NRS 92A.200, NRS 92A.230, and NRS 92A.250 (“Reorganization”). The constituent corporations in the Reorganization were Sauer Energy, Inc. (“SENY” or “Predecessor”), Fast Track Solutions, Inc. (“Successor”), and Fast Track Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”). Jeffrey DeNunzio was the sole director/officer of each constituent corporation in the Reorganization.



Fast Track Solutions, Inc. issued 1,000 common shares of its common stock to Predecessor, and Merger Sub issued 1,000 shares of its common stock to Fast Track Solutions, Inc. immediately prior to the Reorganization. As such, immediately prior to the merger, Fast Track Solutions, Inc. became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Sauer Energy, Inc. and Merger Sub became a wholly owned and direct subsidiary of Fast Track Solutions, Inc.



Pursuant to the above, on April 26, 2021, Sauer Energy, Inc. filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State. The merger became effective on May 5, 2021 at 4:00 PM EST (“Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, Predecessor was merged with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), and Predecessor became the surviving corporation. Each share of Predecessor common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Successor’s common stock.



Fast Track Solutions, Inc., as Successor issuer to Sauer Energy, Inc., continued to trade in the OTC Marketplace under the previous ticker symbol “SENY” until trading under the more recent ticker symbol “FTRK” which the Company used from May 6, 2021 onwards. The Company was given a new CUSIP Number by CUSIP Global Services for its common stock of 31188W108.



On May 5, 2021, after the completion of the Reorganization, we canceled all of the stock we held in Sauer Energy, Inc. resulting in Sauer Energy, Inc. as a stand-alone company. Pursuant to the holding company merger agreement and effects of the Merger, all of the assets and liabilities, if any, remained with Sauer Energy, Inc. after the Reorganization. Jeffrey DeNunzio, the Director of Sauer Energy, Inc., did not discover any assets of Sauer Energy, Inc. from the time he was appointed Director until the completion of the Reorganization and subsequent separation of Sauer Energy, Inc. as a stand-alone company.



Share Exchange Agreement



On July 19, 2021, Fast Track Solutions entered into a Share Purchase Agreement by and among CRS Consulting, LLC, a Wyoming Limited Liability Company (“CRS”), Green Ohio Ventures, LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability Company (“GOHV”), Ian James, and Stephen Letourneau, pursuant to which, on July 30, 2021, CRS sold 700,000 shares of the Fast Track Solutions’ Series A Preferred Stock and 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 89.62% voting control of Fast Track Solutions; 350,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Ian James, 350,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were transferred to Stephen Letourneau, and 250,000,000 shares of Common Stock were transferred to GOHV. The aforementioned purchasers, collectively, paid consideration of three hundred thirty-five thousand dollars ($335,000). The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Share Purchase Agreement resulted in a change in control of Fast Track Solutions, with Ian James, Stephen Letourneau and GOHV becoming the largest controlling stockholders.



Ian James and Stephen Letourneau together retained a majority of the membership interests (collectively constituting approximately 90.6165%) of GOHV, resulting in a respective share of 45.30825% each.











Other Corporate Events



On July 30, 2021, Mr. Jeffrey DeNunzio resigned as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary and Treasurer. In addition, Mr. DeNunzio resigned as Director on July 30, 2021. Mr. Ian James was also appointed as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Stephen Letourneau was appointed Director. The resignation of Mr. DeNunzio was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices.



On August 18, 2021, a Certificate of Amendment to change our name to “Better For You Wellness, Inc.” was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.



On August 27, 2021, Montel Williams, Leslie G. Bumgarner, Joseph J. Watson, David H. Deming, and Dr. Nicola R. Finley, MD, were each appointed by our Board of Directors to serve as Independent Directors of the Company.



On September 17, 2021, we entered into “Term Sheet” with Williamsburg Venture Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“WVH”). WVH is a multi-strategy, private investment fund located in New York, New York. The Term Sheet is a private placement with registration rights, providing WVH the ability to purchase up to $30,500,000 of our Common Stock. The term of the Term Sheet is for 36 months. Following the execution of the Term Sheet, the Company was required to pay WVH $15,000 to cover associated expenses relating to, amongst other things, preparation of future securities agreements relating to the Term Sheet. Upon entering into definitive agreements with WVH for the purchase and sale of equity, WVH was also required to immediately purchase $250,000 of the Company’s restricted common stock from the Company at a 15% discount to the last closing price of our Common Stock as reported by the OTC Markets Group. Any future proceeds from the sale of shares, pursuant to the aforementioned Term Sheet, are to go towards the Company to be used for working capital. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, WVH may not acquire, at any point, more than 4.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock.



On September 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement with SRAX, Inc., a Delaware Company (“SRAX”). Pursuant to the agreement with SRAX, the Company will be granted access to a platform developed by SRAX, known as the “Sequire Platform” which, amongst other things, will allow the Company to access trading data. According to SRAX, the platform is an investor intelligence and communications management platform that allows users to “unlock stock buyers’ behaviors and trends for issuers of publicly traded companies”. In exchange for twelve months of access to the Sequire Platform, we paid SRAX $20,000. Additional fees may be incurred as a result of the SPRAX agreement, but we cannot accurately determine what they may be, although we believe any fees related would be nominal.



On September 17, 2021, we entered into another agreement with SRAX, whereas SRAX will provide advertising and marketing services to the Company on a case-by-case basis, as may be requested by the Company.



On September 17, 2021, Mr. David H. Deming was appointed Secretary of the Company’s Board of Directors.



On September 17, 2021, we engaged Carter Ledyard Milburn LLP as legal counsel, to be consulted on a case-by-case basis as may be necessary for corporate legal services. Any future legal fees that may be incurred are to be billed hourly and may not be static. We believe legal counsel to be important to the growth of the Company going forward.



On September 30, 2021, we began trading under the symbol BFYW on OTC Markets Pink Tier. The new CUSIP number associated with our Common Stock is 08771B105.



On October 1, 2021, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the establishment of an Audit Committee and appointed Montel Williams, David Deming, and Joseph Watson to the newly formed Audit Committee. Our Board of Directors also unanimously approved the establishment of a Compensation Committee and appointed Leslie Bumgarner, Montel Williams, and Joseph Watson to the newly formed Compensation Committee.











On November 18, 2021, Ms. Leslie Bumgarner advised the Company’s Board of Directors that she would resign as a director and Compensation Committee member of the Company effective upon December 31, 2021. The resignation of Ms. Bumgarner was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices.



On December 3, 2021, the Company executed an Amended and Corrected Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Equity Purchase Agreement”) with Williamsburg Venture Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability Company (“WVH”). The Equity Purchase Agreement provides that WVH shall purchase from the Company, upon the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the Company ceasing to be a “shell” company and on the approval of an uplisting to the OTCQB or higher market, $250,000 of the Company’s common stock at a 15% discount to the last closing price of the Company’s Common Stock as reported by the OTC Markets Group.  The Equity Purchase Agreement also provides that, upon the filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 covering all the shares sold to WVH under the Equity Purchase Agreement and related Amended and Corrected Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), WVH shall purchase an additional $250,000 of the Company’s Common Stock at a 15% discount to the last closing price of the Company’s Common Stock as reported by the OTC Markets Group.



On December 3, 2021, the Company also executed the Registration Rights Agreement with WVH.  Under the terms and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, and to induce WVH to enter into the Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to provide certain registration rights under the Securities Act.  The Registration Rights agreement provides that the Company shall, on or before the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day after December 3, 2021, file with the SEC a prospectus supplement on effective Form S-1 covering the maximum number of Registrable Securities (as defined therein) as shall be permitted to be included thereon in accordance with applicable SEC rules, regulations and interpretations so as to permit the resale of such Registrable Securities by the WVH, including but not limited to under Rule 415 under the Securities Act at then prevailing market prices (and not fixed prices), as mutually determined by both the Company and the WVH (the “Initial Registration Statement”). The Initial Registration Statement shall register only registrable securities. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Initial Registration Statement, and any amendment thereto declared effective by the SEC at the earliest possible date (in any event, within ninety (90) calendar days after the filing date of the Initial Registration Statement). The Registration Rights Agreement also provides that the Company is obligated to file additional registration statements under certain circumstances. 



On December 6, 2021, we announced that the Company had formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Glow Market LLC, an Ohio Limited Liability Company, to build and operate digitally-native, mission-driven brands within the clean beauty sector in multiple consumer product categories. Glow Market LLC, launched its first brand, Better Suds, an impact-driven brand that sells cruelty-free natural soap. Better Suds is committed to positively impacting the environment by removing 1 pound of plastic from the ocean for every soap sold through donations to Ocean Blue Project Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization that removes plastics from oceans and waterways. With the Company’s launch of Glow Market LLC, we ceased to be a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, and are no longer a blank-check company.



On December 9, 2021, we announced that the Company had submitted an application to the OTC Markets Group to up-list its Common Stock for trading on the OTC Markets Venture Market, or the OTCQB, and pending the completion of the application process and its acceptance by the OTC Markets Group, the Company expects that its Common Stock will begin trading on the OTCQB under the Company’s current ticker symbol “BFYW”.



On December 14, 2021, we appointed Christina Jefferson to the Board as an Independent Director, effective January 1, 2022, in order to replace Leslie Bumgarner whose resignation became effective December 31, 2021.



On December 15, 2021, we reported on a phased fundraising of up to $1,000,000 USD in a Private Placement of restricted Common Stock to investors who qualify as “accredited investors”.



On February 2, 2022, we received approval from OTC Markets Group to up-list our Common Stock for trading to the OTC Markets Venture Market, or the OTCQB, as of February 3, 2022 under the Company’s current ticker symbol “BFYW”.











On February 5, 2022, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the establishment of a Strategic Advisory Committee tasked with providing acceleration, reach and guidance to further enhance the Company’s value proposition and portfolio. Our Board of Directors appointed six initial Committee Members by unanimous consent including: David King, Laurie Racine, Zhiping Zhang, Melisse Gelula, Christopher Brown, and Kate Hendrickson.



Also on February 5, 2022, by unanimous consent of the five non-executive independent members of our Board of Directors, David Deming was appointed Chairperson of the Company’s Audit Committee, Christina Jefferson was appointed to the Company’s Compensation Committee filling the vacancy left by former director Leslie Bumgarner, and Joseph Watson was appointed as Chairperson of the Company’s Compensation Committee.



On February 11, 2022, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent with Amanda Cayemitte, Yapo M’Be, and Mango Moi, LLC setting forth the contemplated terms for a transaction in which the Company would acquire 100% ownership interest in Mango Moi, LLC and substantially all of the property and assets of Mango Moi including without limitation inventory, formulas, packaging, intellectual property, customer lists, websites, domain names, and social media accounts.



On March 15, 2022, we entered into a Finder’s Fee Agreement with JH Darbie & Co., Inc. Pursuant to which JH Darbie & Co., Inc. would introduce the Issuer to third-party investors.



On April 12, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Mast Hill Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, pursuant to which Mast Hill Fund, L.P. purchased a promissory note, with a principal amount of $310,000 for a purchase price of $279,000 bearing an original issue discount of $31,000, interest of 12% per year and a maturity date of April 12, 2023.

FORM OF ACQUISITION



The manner in which the Registrant participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Registrant and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Registrant and such promoters.



It is likely that the Registrant will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Registrant. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity.



We anticipate difficulty in obtaining financing from other sources since we have no income and zero cash reserves. We are presently reliant on capital contributions towards expenses from Mr. Ian James, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Ian James has not guaranteed that he will continue to support our capital needs. Therefore, we may not have the ability to continue as a going concern.



In addition, depending upon the transaction, the Registrants current stockholders may be substantially diluted to less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity and possibly even eliminated as stockholders by an acquisition.



The present stockholders of the Registrant will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Registrant following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all, or a majority of, the Registrant’s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.



The Company anticipates that prior to consummating any acquisition or merger, the Company, if required by relevant state laws and regulations, will seek to have the transaction approved by stockholders in the appropriate manner. Certain types of transactions may be entered into solely by Board of Directors approval without stockholder approval. Under Nevada law, certain actions that would routinely be taken at a meeting of stockholders, may be taken by written consent of stockholders having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take the action at a meeting of stockholders. Thus, if stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares decide by written consent to consummate an acquisition or a merger, minority stockholders would not be given the opportunity to vote on the issue. If stockholder approval is required, the Board will have discretion to consummate the transaction by written consent if it is determined to be in the Company’s best interest to do so. Regardless of whether an acquisition or merger is approved by Board action alone, by written consent or by holding a stockholders’ meeting, the Company will provide to its stockholders complete disclosure documentation concerning the potential target including requisite financial statements. This information will be disseminated by proxy statement in the event a stockholders’ meeting is held, or by an information statement if the action is taken by written consent.



It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. We estimate such cost to be approximately $10,000. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.



We presently have no employees apart from our management, which consists of two full time employees, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ian James, as well as Chief Branding Officer and Director, Stephen Letourneau. Our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business approximately forty (40) hours per week. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.











Furthermore, the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Ian James, the sole officer and director of the Company, who is not a professional business analyst and in all likelihood will not be experienced in matters relating to the target business opportunity. The inexperience of Mr. James and the fact that the analysis and evaluation of a potential business combination is to be taken under his supervision may adversely impact the Company’s ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination. There is no guarantee that Mr. James will be able to identify a business combination target that is suitable for the Company. Ian James, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and sole officer, may hire third parties to conduct an analysis for a target company or any other business opportunities.
