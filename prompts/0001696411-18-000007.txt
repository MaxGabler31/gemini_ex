General description of our activity 
 
We were incorporated on October 6, 2016 in the State of Nevada, USA. The Companys business operations are located in Romania. As of December 31, 2017 Crona Corp. has generated revenues of $36,210 in Romania, Bucharest. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. 
 
We can book as little as one hour or as many as 24 hours per day, allowing the business to focus on providing recording services for record labels, music producers, and recording artists. The facility and its equipment are rented on either an hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly basis as dictated by the clients needs. 
 In addition to studio and engineer/producer services, and in the course of ongoing business, it is customary in the recording industry that the Studio will occasionally enter into certain licensing agreements that will provide revenue over and above the rental and services income. There is no particular standard as to the frequency or amount of this revenue and it is negotiated on an individual basis. These licensing agreements can include, but are not limited to, production agreements, writer agreements, and performing agreements, all yielding a percentage of revenue earned through the exploitation of the product produced.
 Our target markets are artists, organizers of various events and representatives of various industries of show business (TV, cinema, and entertainment clubs).
 We expect to face strong competition from well-established companies and small independent companies like our self that may result in price reductions and decreased demand for service of music studio. There are several companies in Romania in our industry, such as: DAW.RO, INES Studios, and Harmonix Recording Studio. Management believes that we can develop ourselves in the industry, once we attract customers and become profitable.
 Licensing

 The license agreements typically grant the production and distribution company rights to a music single or all of an act's music in a particular country or region with a term of three to fifteen years. The production or distribution company can then distribute the music in record or CD format, mp3, ring tone, or any other music media licensed in the agreement.

Crona Corp. is a professional recording studio. We are distinguished by skillful use of modern digital technology traditional analog devices. Music is our world, so we fullydedicate ourselves to sound recording perfection.  
OUR RECORDERS
 Stand-alone digital multitrack recorders that have everything needed for recording, mixing, and producing music. The advantage digital multitrack recorders have over computer based mixing is that they force you to use your ears - when watching a computer screen it is sometimes tempting to mix with your eyes.
OUR MIXERS
 We provide a guide to studio mixing consoles. The audio mixer is literally the heart of every live performance, where all sounds converge to be processed and blended - and finally pumped out through the speakers. It is where major connections are routed to, and where important parameters are set including volume, EQ adjustments, balancing and many more.
MICROPHONES
 We focus on top rated condenser and dynamic microphones that are currently being used in professional studios. Note that while the main consideration is vocal recording, the microphones we feature also work well with instruments, making them ideal additions to any studio.
COMPRESSORS
 A compressor reduces the dynamic range of a signal, in other words, it reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest levels. A limiter places an upper ceiling on the output level to prevent clipping - in the digital world clipping instantly becomes distortion.
MONITORS
 When you need to work on your recorded music you need to hear exactly how it sounds, warts and all. Generally speaking, multimedia and hi-fi speakers are not suitable for the task because they tend to color the sound. This is where good studio monitors come in, they reproduce sound as transparently as possible, so you can make honest assessments and apply the right adjustments to your mix.
INSTRUMENTS
 In the near future the Company is planning to add additional instruments to those already purchased, such as Electric Guitar, Bass, Acoustic Guitar, Keyboards and Drums. 
Employees and Employment Agreements
 
We have no employees to date. Our sole officer and director, Robert T. Malasek, currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week to company matters. After receiving funding, Robert T. Malasek plans to devote as much time to the operation of the Company as he determines is necessary for him to manage the affairs of the Company. As our business and operations increase, we will assess the need for full time management and administrative support personnel.   Item 1A.  Risk Factors
