 The Companys News and Information Services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. 
 The Companys newspapers, magazines, digital publications and radio stations compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, magazines and radio stations, social media sources, as well as other media such as television and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the Companys News and Information Services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital applications, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms. Shifts in consumer behavior, including the widespread adoption of mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and information is consumed, require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes.

 Dow Jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg L.P., LexisNexis, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. 
 NAM competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. The Company believes that based on the scale of NAMs home-delivered products, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the growing audience for its digital marketing platform, NAM provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. The Company is also actively investing in shopper research and data-based insights that enable an advanced understanding of how to apply the Companys media and incentive network to achieve the greatest impact and value for clients and partners.

Its print and digital global catalog includes more than 200,000 publications in different formats, in 17 languages, and it licenses rights for its authors works to be published in more than 50 languages around the world. HarperCollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, childrens and religious content. Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market. 
 As of June 30, 2018, HarperCollins offered approximately 100,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 19% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. 
 During fiscal 2018, HarperCollins U.S. had 118 titles on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 20 titles hitting number one, including Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson, The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn, Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly, Hello, Universe by Erin Hunter, Dear Girl by Amy Krouse Rosenthal & Paris Rosenthal, Big Nate by Lincoln Pierce, The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Come and Get It by Ree Drummond, and The Plant Paradox by Steven R. Grundy. 
 HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Companys second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.

 The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. Furthermore, HarperCollins is a leader in childrens and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption.

 The Companys Digital Real Estate Services segment consists of its 61.6% interest in REA Group, a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move. The remaining 20% interest in Move is held by REA Group.

The realestate.com.au mobile application has been downloaded over 7.9 million times and launched more than any other property application according to Nielsen Digital Content Ratings. Realestate.com.au derives the majority of its revenue from its core property advertising listing products and monthly advertising subscriptions from real estate agents and property developers. Realestate.com.au offers a product hierarchy which enables real estate agents and property developers to upgrade listing advertisements to increase their prominence on the site, as well as a variety of targeted products, including media display advertising products.

The financial services business generates revenue primarily through fees and commissions from lenders, mortgage brokers and other customers. 
 REA Group competes primarily with other property websites in its geographic markets, including domain.com.au in Australia. 
 Move 
 Move is a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates realtor.com®, a premier real estate information and services marketplace, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors® (NAR). Through realtor.com®, consumers have access to over 130 million properties across the U.S., including an extensive collection of homes and properties listed and displayed for sale and a large database of off-market properties. Realtor.com® and its related mobile applications display approximately 98% of all Multiple Listing Services (MLS)-listed, for-sale and rental properties in the U.S., which are primarily sourced directly from relationships with MLSs across the country. Approximately 95% of its for-sale listings are updated at least every 15 minutes, on average, with the remaining listings updated daily. Realtor.com®s content attracts a highly engaged consumer audience. Based on internal data, realtor.com® and its mobile sites had 63 million average monthly unique users during the quarter ended June 30, 2018. These users viewed an average of over two billion pages and spent an average of nearly two billion minutes on the realtor.com® website and mobile applications each month. 
 Realtor.com®  generates the majority of its revenues through the sale of listing advertisement products, including ConnectionsSM for Buyers and AdvantageSM Pro, which allow real estate agents, brokers and franchises to enhance, prioritize and connect with consumers on for-sale property listings within the realtor.com® website and mobile applications. Listing advertisements are typically sold on a subscription basis. Realtor.com® also derives revenue from sales of non-listing advertisement, or Media, products to real estate, finance, insurance, home improvement and other professionals that enable those professionals to connect with realtor.com®s highly engaged and valuable consumer audience. Media products include sponsorships, display advertisements, text links, directories and Digital Advertising Package. Non-listing advertisement pricing models include cost per thousand, cost per click, cost per unique user and subscription-based sponsorships of specific content areas or targeted geographies. 
 In addition to realtor.com®, Move also offers a number of professional software and services products. These include the Top Producer® and FiveStreet® productivity and lead management tools and services, which are tailored to real estate agents and sold on a subscription basis, as well as the ListHubTM service, which syndicates for-sale listing information from MLSs and other reliable data sources, such as real estate brokerages, and distributes that content to an array of web sites. Listing syndication pricing includes fixed- or variable-pricing models based on listing counts, while ListHubTMs advanced reporting products are sold on a monthly subscription basis. 
 Move competes primarily with other real estate websites and mobile applications focused on the U.S. real estate market, including zillow.com and trulia.com. 
 Subscription Video Services 
 The Companys Subscription Video Services segment provides video sports, entertainment and news services to pay-TV subscribers and other commercial licensees, primarily via cable, satellite and Internet Protocol, or IP, distribution, and consists of (i) its 65% interest in new Foxtel and (ii) Australian News Channel Pty Ltd (ANC). The remaining 35% interest in new Foxtel is held by Telstra. 
 
11 


 New Foxtel 
 New Foxtel is the largest pay-TV provider in Australia, delivering over 200 channels (including standard definition channels, high definition versions of some of those channels and audio and interactive channels) covering sports, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music, childrens programming and news. New Foxtel offers the leading sports programming content in Australia, with a suite of sports channels that includes FOX SPORTS 501, FOX LEAGUE, FOX SPORTS 503, FOX FOOTY, FOX SPORTS 505, FOX SPORTS 506, FOX SPORTS MORE and FOX SPORTS NEWS. It also expects to launch a new FOX CRICKET channel beginning with the 2018 cricket season. New Foxtels channels together broadcast over 13,000 hours of live sports programming per year, encompassing both live national and international licensed sports events such as National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, the domestic football league, the Australian Rugby Union and various motorsports programming, as well as other featured original and licensed premium sports content tailored to the Australian market. New Foxtels premium entertainment and news content includes television programming from HBO, FOX and Universal, among others, 29 channels owned and operated by new Foxtel, including general entertainment and movie channels, and an extensive range of movie programming sourced through arrangements with major U.S. studios. 
 New Foxtels channels are distributed to subscribers via both Telstras hybrid fibrecoaxial cable network and a long-term contracted satellite platform provided by Optus. Cable and satellite distribution is enabled by new Foxtels set-top boxes, including the iQ3. New Foxtel also offers versions of its services via the Internet through Foxtel Now, an Internet television service available on a number of compatible devices (including the Foxtel Now box, mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, Chromecast, Telstra TV, Sony PlayStation, Xbox One and select smart TVs). In addition, cable, satellite and Foxtel Now subscribers have access to Foxtel App, an Internet television companion service that allows subscribers to watch new Foxtels content via mobile devices and tablets. New Foxtel also offers a triple play bundle product, which consists of new Foxtels existing pay-TV services, sold together with broadband and home phone services. In addition to its pay-TV services, New Foxtel operates foxsports.com.au, a leading general sports website in Australia, and Watch NRL and Watch AFL internationally. 
 New Foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. Results at new Foxtel can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of its local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. The following table provides information regarding certain key performance indicators for new Foxtel: 
 

 | FY 2018 
Total Subscribers(1) | 2,824,645 
ARPU(2) | A$80.45 (US$59.58)
Churn(3) | 13.8% 


(1) | Subscribing households and residential equivalent business units throughout Australia as of June 30, 2018. Total number of subscribers represents total residential and commercial subscribers to the Companys pay-TV services through cable, satellite and IP distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships. Commercial subscribers are calculated as residential equivalent units, which are derived by dividing total revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average residential ARPU (as defined below) which is held constant through the year. Customers receiving service for no charge under certain new subscriber promotions are excluded from the Companys subscriber count.

(2) | Average monthly broadcast residential subscription revenue per user (excluding Optus) (Broadcast ARPU) for the year ended June 30, 2018. The Company calculates Broadcast ARPU by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period is calculated by adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by two.

(3) | Broadcast residential subscriber churn rate (Broadcast subscriber churn) for the year ended June 30, 2018. Broadcast subscriber churn represents the number of cable and satellite residential subscribers whose service is disconnected, expressed as a percentage of the average total number of cable and satellite residential subscribers, presented on an annual basis. The Company calculates Broadcast subscriber churn by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the average subscribers for the period, which is calculated by adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by two. This amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 New Foxtel competes for audiences primarily with the Free To Air (FTA) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, as well as other pay-TV operators, IP television, or IPTV, providers and subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD, services such as Fetch TV, Netflix, Stan, Amazon Prime Video, hayu and Mubi. The Company believes that new Foxtels premium and exclusive content, wide array of digital and mobile features that enable subscribers to record, rewind, discover and watch content, its investment in On Demand capability and programming and benefits through broadband bundling enable it to offer subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. 
 Australian News Channel 
 ANC operates 10 channels featuring the latest in news, politics, sports, entertainment, public affairs, business and weather. ANC is licensed by Sky International AG to use Sky trademarks and domain names in connection with its operation and distribution of channels and services.

In addition, ANC has program supply arrangements with third parties such as WIN Corporation. ANC primarily generates revenue through monthly affiliate fees received from pay-TV providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising. 
 ANC competes primarily with other news providers in Australia and New Zealand via its subscription television channels, third party content arrangements and free domain website. Its Australia Channel IPTV service also competes against over-the-top IPTV subscription-based news providers in regions outside of Australia and New Zealand. 
Other 
 The Other segment includes the Companys general corporate overhead expenses, corporate Strategy Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Companys Strategy Group identifies new products and services across the Companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and targets and assesses potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions. Initiatives include News IQ, the Companys data-driven digital advertising platform that enables targeting and engagement of premium audiences at scale across the Companys network of assets. As part of its ongoing role in assessing potential acquisitions and investments, the Strategy Group also oversaw the Companys acquisitions of Move, a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S., Unruly, a global video advertising marketplace and Wireless Group, operator of talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K. The Strategy Group also oversees the Companys strategic digital investments in India, including Elara, which owns PropTiger.com, Housing.com and Makaan.com.

 Governmental Regulation 
 General 
 Various aspects of the Companys activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Companys products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the Companys interests. 
Australian Media Regulation 
 The Companys subscription television interests are subject to Australias regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (the Broadcasting Services Act) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) (the Telecommunications Act) and associated Codes. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority. 
 Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictionscurrently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of Australias two major government-funded broadcasters; (b) other parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that may impact the Companys ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities; and (c) various consumer protection regimes under the Telecommunications Act and associated Codes, which apply to new Foxtel as a telecommunications service provider. 
 Data Privacy and Security 
 The Companys business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Companys websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted Internet advertisements. More state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. 
 Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union and to replace the existing Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). Fully applicable and enforceable as of May 25, 2018, the GDPR expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and 
 
14 


  freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros, or approximately 23 million U.S. dollars, or 4% of an entitys worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communication (e-Privacy) Directive with a regulation to, among other things, amend the current directives rules on the use of cookies and opt-outs.
In 2016, the European Commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the European Union to the United States called the Privacy Shield. The Company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the Privacy Shield framework for data transfers among the Companys businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. However, certain of the Companys service providers do rely on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by U.S. and E.U. authorities, that could affect the Companys or its service providers obligations thereunder. The other mechanisms that the Company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the European data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. Challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services. 
 In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. 
 Industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. 
 The interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the United States and internationally. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Companys data privacy and security compliance programs. 
 U.K. Press Regulation 
 As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the new Press Recognition Panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. 
 Publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections 
 
15 


  and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. IPSO has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Companys newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. 
 U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation 
 The Companys radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Companys intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. These licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, Football Federation Australia and Australian Rugby Union described in Note 16 to the Financial Statements; (2) licenses from various third parties, including ARRIS, of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the Companys pay-TV business; (3) the trademark license from NAR for the realtor.com® trademark and website address, as well as the REALTOR® trademark (the NAR License); and (4) the trademark licenses from Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Fox International Channels (US) Inc. for the use of FOX formative trademarks used in the Companys pay-TV and sports programming businesses in Australia (the Fox Licenses). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-TV services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties. 
 The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Companys products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Companys intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 
 Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Companys intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited 
 
16 


  in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. 
 Raw Materials 
 As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Companys paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. 
Employees 
 As of June 30, 2018, the Company had approximately 28,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the U.S., 5,000 were located in the U.K. and 10,000 were located in Australia. Of the Companys employees, approximately 6,000 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good.
