Item 1. Business.
Overview
Etsy is the global marketplace for unique and creative goods. We connect creative entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items made by real people. Our mission is to “Keep Commerce Human.” Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York.
Our sellers are the heart and soul of Etsy, and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our sellers make money. We offer a wide range of Seller Services and tools that are specifically designed to help creative entrepreneurs start, manage and scale their businesses.
Buyers tell us that they come to Etsy because Etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else. Our goal is to encourage existing and potential buyers to visit the Etsy marketplace on “special” purchase occasions throughout the year. These special purchase occasions include shopping that reflects an individual's unique style; gifting that demonstrates thought and care; and celebrations that express creativity and fun. They happen throughout the year when a buyer is decorating a home, dressing for an event, celebrating a special moment or buying a gift for someone special.
As of December 31, 2017, our marketplace connected 1.9 million active Etsy sellers to 33.4 million active Etsy buyers. Etsy buyers and sellers are located all over the world, and our six core geographic markets are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany. We will continue to invest in these markets, as this is where we have our strongest concentration of both buyers and sellers, and continue to evaluate geographies in which to make strategic investments. There are currently more than 50 million items for sale across more than 50 retail categories on Etsy.com. In 2017, our marketplace generated $3.3 billion of Gross Merchandise Sales, (“GMS”), of which approximately 51% came from purchases made on mobile devices. In 2017, the top six retail categories based on GMS were: clothing and accessories, home and living, jewelry, craft supplies, art and collectibles, and paper and party supplies. We are a global company and 33% of our 2017 GMS was generated when the Etsy seller or Etsy buyer, or both, were located outside of the United States.
Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services and tools we provide to Etsy sellers to help them start, manage, and scale their businesses. Marketplace revenue is comprised of the 3.5% transaction fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the $0.20 listing fee she pays for each item she lists (for up to four months) on Etsy.com. Seller Services revenue is comprised of the fees our sellers pay Etsy for our four paid services: Etsy Payments (formerly called Direct Checkout), our payment processing service; Promoted Listings, our on-site advertising service that allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results; Shipping Labels, which allows sellers in the United States and Canada to purchase discounted shipping labels; and Pattern by Etsy, a service that allows sellers to build custom websites. We generate additional revenue through our commercial partnerships.

Our Opportunity
We believe that the nature of commerce is continuing to evolve: more people are choosing to purchase goods online and many consumers are looking for unique items as an alternative to mass produced goods. According to eMarketer, a market research company, worldwide retail ecommerce sales are expected to be $2.3 trillion in 2017, up from $1.9 trillion in 2016. Further, eMarketer estimates that worldwide retail ecommerce will generate double-digit growth each year through 2021, and that worldwide retail ecommerce sales will reach $4.5 trillion by the end of 2021. (Source: eMarketer—Worldwide Retail Ecommerce Sales: eMarketer's Estimates for 2016-2021.) Within this retail ecommerce market, we believe that the market opportunity for “special” purchase occasions is significant. Special purchase occasions occur frequently throughout the year and span a wide variety of specific events and retail categories, including Etsy’s top six retail categories:

2017 Estimated Annual Spend in Top Etsy Retail Categories and Core Geographies

We estimate that the online market size in these six retail categories, within our six core geographic markets (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany), represents a $155 billion dollar market opportunity and a $1.3 trillion market opportunity when offline is included.

Our Platform
Etsy leverages technology to connect people around the world through commerce. Our platform includes our marketplace, our Seller Services and tools, our passionate and engaged sellers and buyers, and our technology. Our commitment to transparency and integrity underpins our platform and establishes trust within our marketplace and our community. 

Key Components of Our Platform

Our Marketplace
Our marketplace, Etsy.com, is where thoughtful buyers come to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere. In a world of increasing automation and commoditization, Etsy celebrates creativity and human interaction. 
We believe our marketplace is characterized by several unique qualities, including:

• | Unique Products: Our marketplace boasts a large assortment of handmade, vintage, and craft supply products from all of the world. There are currently more than 50 million items listed across more than 50 retail categories. We intend to continue to invest in our search and discovery capabilities to help buyers efficiently find the unique items they are seeking and to create a more immersive and engaging discovery experience on Etsy.com.


• | Global Reach: Etsy’s six core geographic markets are the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany, and there are people using our platform to buy and sell in nearly every country in the world. Our platform makes it easy for Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers to interact across borders even if they do not speak the same language and wish to transact in different currencies. We use innovative machine translation technology to translate listings, reviews, promoted listings, and conversations between Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers. Our payments platform makes it easy for Etsy sellers to offer Etsy buyers a wide range of payment options. In 2017, 35% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 33% of our GMS was generated between an Etsy seller, Etsy buyer, or both, located outside of the United States.


• | Organic Traffic Base: We’ve built a loyal, global base of buyers on the platform without significant investment in acquisition marketing until 2013, eight years after being founded. Unlike many other ecommerce companies, the vast majority of visits to Etsy.com came through organic channels. In fact, approximately, 88% of visits in 2017 were from organic sources, including a large portion from buyers visiting Etsy.com directly as well as from non-paid channels such as search, social, email, and push notifications.


• | Connection Between Buyers and Sellers: We believe that human connection is central to buyer engagement. Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers use the Conversations tool on our platform to communicate directly about their orders; to request custom goods or personalization of goods; or simply to have a conversation about the product. The ability to have items custom-made or personalized means that buyers can find special items that they can’t find anywhere else. We also encourage engagement between Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers in a variety of other ways, such as through sharing reviews on social media or connecting offline through the Etsy Local feature on our mobile app.


• | Connected Experience Across all Devices: We want to engage Etsy buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience no matter how they come to Etsy. Our Etsy.com website and iOS and Android mobile apps include search and discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features. We offer a connected experience through each channel, desktop, mobile web, and mobile app, to help ensure that no matter what device our buyers use they will have the best possible experience. To optimize our mobile experience, we use deep linking to automatically transition Etsy buyers from mobile web to the mobile app when they tap specific banners within our mobile web experience. Buyers can sign-up and sign-in to Etsy through Facebook and Google and our payment options include credit cards, debit cards,

PayPal, Google Wallet, Apple Pay and others. Our mobile apps have been downloaded approximately 50 million times as of December 31, 2017.

• | Buyer Intent; People Come to Etsy to Browse and be Inspired: Our platform is designed to provide a personalized search experience to Etsy buyers, adjusting in real time based on transaction data and previous browsing history. A large portion of our buyers come to Etsy not in search of a specific item, but to browse and be inspired. We are continuing to build more sophisticated algorithms that allow us to deliver more personalized results to our buyers, utilizing browse and transaction data to surface items they didn't know they wanted. In 2017, we launched a number of products to enhance search, including context specific search ranking and guided search. All of this helps bring fun to the discovery and shopping experience. We believe we have several opportunities to further enhance our search and discovery capabilities and plan to leverage our machine learning technology to deliver an even more personalized shopping experience.

Our Seller Services and Tools
Seller Services and tools help Etsy sellers start, manage, and scale their businesses. In addition to driving incremental revenue streams to Etsy, our Seller Services play a key role in reducing friction in sales conversions and in driving velocity and growth in our marketplace, which supports healthy GMS growth.

Use of Seller Services in 2017

Our four paid Seller Services are: Etsy Payments, Promoted Listings, Shipping Labels and Pattern. We launched our first Seller Service in late 2011 and in 2017 Seller Services revenue grew 28.7%, and represented 58.6% of our total revenue, up from 55.0% in 2016. In 2017, 54.3% of active sellers used at least one of our four paid Seller Services versus 51.7% in 2016:

• | Etsy Payments (formerly called Direct Checkout). Etsy Payments enables sellers to accept various forms of payment such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, Google Wallet, Apple Pay and Etsy Gift Cards. Once an Etsy buyer makes payment, the Etsy seller receives the funds in her own bank account and in her local currency. As of December 31, 2017, Etsy Payments was available in 36 countries and 12 currencies. As of May 2017, nearly all sellers in countries where Etsy Payments is available were required to use the service. Pricing is calculated at 3-4% of total transaction value plus an additional flat fee ranging from $0.20 - $0.51, charged in local currency. Etsy Payments is our largest Seller Services revenue stream and during 2017, 49.9% of active sellers used Etsy Payments up from 45.5% in 2016, and 85% of total GMS flowed through Etsy Payments in 2017, up from 78% in 2016.


• | Promoted Listings. Promoted Listings enable Etsy sellers to pay a cost-per-click based fee to feature and promote their goods in our marketplace in search results generated by Etsy buyers. This service allows Etsy sellers to target Etsy buyers who are specifically searching for goods similar to those she offers for sale. Promoted Listings is our second largest Seller Services revenue stream and during 2017, 15.0% of active sellers used Promoted Listings down from 15.9% in 2016. In 2017, we enhanced Promoted Listings with new ad inventory on all devices (desktop, mobile app and mobile web). With this additional inventory and enhanced algorithms we saw higher click-through rates, which led to accelerated year-over-year revenue growth for this service.


• | Shipping Labels. This service allows sellers in the United States and Canada to purchase discounted United States Postal Service, FedEx and Canada Post shipping labels through our platform. The ability to print the shipping labels at home reduces the cost and time it takes Etsy sellers to ship items to Etsy buyers, reduces the chance for administrative error through features such as auto population of shipping addresses, and automatically provides tracking information and shipping notifications to buyers. Shipping Labels is our third largest Seller Services revenue stream and during 2017, 28.1% of active sellers in the United States and Canada used Shipping Labels up from 26.3% in 2016.

4


• | Pattern. With Pattern, Etsy sellers can create their own custom websites with unique domain names within minutes. Pattern imports listings and content from Etsy shops, syncs inventory and orders, and utilizes our Etsy Payments and Shipping Label services. In 2017, we began allowing sellers to sell items or services on their Pattern website that don't follow the handmade and vintage guidelines within our Etsy.com marketplace. Sellers may use Pattern for free for the first 30 days, then they are charged $15/month, plus transaction and payment processing fees, and Shipping Label fees, if they choose to use this service. Pattern is our smallest Seller Services revenue stream and, during 2017, 2.5% of active sellers used Pattern, consistent with 2016.

We believe we can grow Seller Services revenue three ways: expand the utility of existing Seller Services, expand the geographic reach of existing Seller Services, and launch new Seller Services offerings. In addition to our paid Seller Services, we provide a wide range of tools and educational resources to give Etsy sellers the support they need to manage the administrative side of their businesses. According to our bi-annual seller survey, most recently conducted in 2016, for every hour that an Etsy seller spends making her products, she spends almost another hour doing business-related tasks, including inventory management, marketing, shipping, customer service and accounting. Our tools and educational resources help manage these administrative burdens.

• | Seller Tools. We offer a variety of free tools to Etsy sellers, including marketing tools such as our Google Shopping tool, sales and promotions tool, and social media tool, which help sellers with their marketing needs and allow them to stand out on and off the Etsy platform. Through a partnership with Intuit, sellers in the United States and the United Kingdom can simplify their accounting and bookkeeping. Our Shop Manager dashboard, which we launched in 2017, serves as a centralized hub for Etsy sellers to track orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics and have conversations with their customers across all of their Etsy shops.


• | Education. We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to start, manage and scale their businesses on our platform, including blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on Etsy.com), Etsy.com online forums and insights from Etsy.com support teams. In addition to our resources, Etsy sellers connect through self-organized Etsy Teams to build personal relationships with other Etsy sellers, collaborate, educate and support each other as they build their independent creative businesses. Currently, over 15,000 Etsy Teams have formed around the world.

Etsy’s focus on supporting our sellers in starting, managing and scaling their businesses strengthens our marketplace and positions it for continued growth. When our sellers succeed, Etsy succeeds.

Our Passionate and Engaged Sellers and Buyers
Etsy Sellers
We serve creative entrepreneurs around the world who choose to pursue their passions, offering them a global base of millions of buyers and a cohesive suite of services and tools. Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants, and have a broad range of personal and professional goals. Our 2016 seller survey found that 60% of Etsy sellers are multi-channel sellers and on average Etsy is their primary source of sales. 
According to the 2016 seller survey:

• | 87% identify as women;


• | 73% consider their Etsy shop to be a business;


• | 97% run their shops from their homes;


• | 81% aspire to grow their sales in the future; and


• | 62% started their Etsy shop as a way to supplement income.

In addition to our 2016 seller survey, we conducted a separate survey of our top decile sellers in 2017. Key findings included that 95% of our top decile sellers intended to remain with Etsy for the next 12 months.
According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, 20-30% of the working-age population, or up to 162 million people, currently engage in independent work in the U.S. and E.U.-15. The study notes that if all individuals pursued their preferred working style, the number of independent workers could grow to up to 268 million. (Source: McKinsey Global Institute - Independent work: Choice, Necessity, and the Gig Economy). We believe that our base of Etsy sellers reflects these changing dynamics. Our 2016 seller survey found that 33% of Etsy sellers were pursuing their creative business as their sole occupation, up from 30% in our 2014 seller survey.

Etsy Buyers
In a 2016 survey of Etsy.com buyers, 91% of buyers agreed that Etsy offers products they cannot find anywhere else. Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and build relationships through direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase customized items and craft supplies from Etsy sellers. By shopping on Etsy.com, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world.

• | Repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of Etsy buyers. In 2017, approximately 39.6% of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months.


Active Buyers by Purchase Type

Unlike many other ecommerce companies, the vast majority of visits come to Etsy from organic channels. In 2017, 88% of visits came to Etsy.com from an organic source, including a large portion from buyers visiting Etsy.com directly as well as from non-paid channels such as search, social, email, and push notifications. A visit represents activity from a unique browser or mobile app. A visit ends after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Etsy Seller & Buyer Retention
Our active sellers and active buyers remain so for multiple years. For example, 31.8% of active sellers and 38.7% of active buyers as of December 31, 2014 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform and 31.5% of active sellers and 41.1% of active buyers as of December 31, 2013 continued to be active sellers and active buyers through their fourth year on the platform. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, 17.7% of active sellers have been selling on Etsy for more than four years. Likewise, as of December 31, 2017, 21.8% of active buyers have been Etsy buyers for more than four years.

See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Performance—Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers” for more information.
Our Technology 
The Etsy marketplace enables the millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. We believe our experienced engineering team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment. We update the code that runs the Etsy website as often as every 20 minutes, and as many as 70 times per day. To enhance the performance of our platform, we collect and analyze a large volume of data. For example, we currently capture more than one billion user-generated events every day to produce personalized recommendations, improve our search experience and test features on our site.
In 2017, we increased the velocity of experiments focused on Etsy.com, and the rate at which we are going from idea, to experiment, to test, to launch has significantly increased compared with prior years.
Our machine learning and machine translation technologies play an important role in making it easy for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to connect across our platform even if they don’t speak the same language. We translate listings within our marketplace into 10 languages, significantly increasing the inventory available to non-English speaking Etsy buyers and giving Etsy sellers access to a truly global audience. We also translate conversations and reviews and are applying machine translation to translate Promoted Listings. We are also leveraging our machine learning technology to advance our search capabilities and enable shoppers to more easily browse, filter for and buy that perfect item.

In December 2017, we announced our Google Cloud partnership, an initiative that will transition our marketplace and infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform, enabling our technology team to focus on strategic initiatives, enhance site performance, and improve engineering efficiency. Google's infrastructure will also enable us to better prioritize technologies like machine learning to personalize the user experience on Etsy. We expect the transition to Google Cloud Platform to be complete within the next two years.
We strive to offer our sellers and buyers an engaging experience, regardless of the device they choose to use to engage with us. Our mobile website and our “Buy on Etsy” mobile app for Etsy buyers, which we developed to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, include search, discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features, optimized for the mobile experience. Additionally, our “Sell on Etsy” mobile app helps the Etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders.
For the year ended December 31, 2017 approximately 66% of our visits and approximately 51% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. This is up compared with 2016, during which 64% of our visits and 48% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. We are focused on increasing conversion rates in general; however, we are particularly focused on mobile web, which accounted for 46% of our overall visits in 2017 up from 45% in 2016, and continued to be the largest driver of both overall visits growth and mobile GMS growth. Mobile web conversion rate is about half the conversion rate on desktop and the conversion rate on mobile Buy on Etsy app is about 1.2x the desktop conversion rate. Therefore, if mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits, it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains. 
Commitment to Integrity and Transparency
Members of our community rely on us to maintain a trusted marketplace. Our policies are designed to encourage transparency and clearly outline the rights and responsibilities of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers participating on our platform. Most fundamentally, we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade, vintage or craft supplies. In 2017, we updated and clarified our policies on Etsy.com to, among other things, make it easier for Etsy sellers and buyers to understand how we define handmade. 
Transparency within our community helps to support our trustworthiness. For example, we publish an annual report that details progress toward our ideals and shares our hopes for the years to come. We also annually report statistics regarding shops that do not meet our guidelines or which list items that are alleged to infringe third party rights. In 2017, we closed 4,494 Etsy.com shops that were subject to repeat notices of intellectual property infringement and closed 316,801 Etsy.com accounts for non-IP policy violations.
We strive to give the Etsy buyer comfort that she is purchasing goods from a shop that adheres to certain principles. Etsy buyers have a high degree of insight into Etsy sellers’ business practices. Our policies ask Etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We also have dedicated teams and sophisticated tools to help enforce our policies. For example, our Integrity team uses a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated flags to review items and shops that may violate our policies. Our Trust and Safety team helps to prevent and detect fraud through human review and automated tools and algorithms. We also recognize that sometimes transactions don’t go as planned. When that happens, our online Case System provides a way for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to communicate with each other to resolve disputes. In 2017, 0.3% of orders resulted in a case. 
We also establish trust by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections between Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and apps and in-person events, highlighting personal relationships as a key part of the Etsy experience. For example, Etsy sellers are encouraged to share their stories to reach Etsy buyers on our platform and on social media. The trustworthiness of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are cornerstones of our business.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is focused on growing our Etsy.com marketplace in our six core geographies and owning special purchase occasions – style, gifting and celebrations – throughout the year. We believe that buyers shop for special occasions many times throughout the year, so our goal is to have them think of Etsy more often and return to our marketplace more frequently. We aim to empower our passionate community of 1.9 million sellers to compete and win against mass retailers for special shopping occasions. 
In May 2017, we appointed Josh Silverman as our Chief Executive Officer and Rachel Glaser as our Chief Financial Officer, and in July 2017, we appointed Mike Fisher as our Chief Technology Officer.  Since joining us, our new management team has sought to sharpen our focus on key initiatives and realign our internal resources to pursue the highest growth opportunities in order to deliver value to our stakeholders.  As part of this realignment, we identified and began implementing the following four key initiatives to help us execute on our new strategy:

• | Improving trust and reliability: Since our sellers have relatively unknown brands and unbranded items, we aim to ensure that the Etsy brand is recognized and valued for its trust and reliability throughout the buying experience. Our goal is to bolster trust in the Etsy brand, Etsy sellers, the items available in our marketplace and in the overall Etsy experience. In 2017, we improved buyer confidence with the launch of several new products including a Best Seller badge, a structured return policy for sellers, and Multishop Checkout, among others.


• | Enhancing search and discovery: With over 50 million items listed on Etsy.com that don’t map to a catalog or a stock keeping unit (“SKU”), our challenge is delivering world-class search and discovery technology that surfaces the right product to the right buyer at the right time in order to drive conversion and buyer satisfaction. By utilizing artificial intelligence and machine learning we can help buyers more easily browse, filter and find the item they desire. Throughout 2017, we continued to make more enhancements to improve the search and discovery experience in our marketplace. We launched Context Specific Search Ranking (“CSR”), which leverages transactional and user data to create a more personalized search experience and Guided Search which helps buyers narrow search results through suggested search reformulations. Also, we launched scarcity badges to alert buyers when items are only available in limited quantities. Scarcity badges reinforce the specialness of our marketplace, and we believe there is significant room for continued optimization with these kinds of buyer nudges.


• | Building world-class marketing capabilities: We need outstanding marketing capabilities to amplify the voice and relevance of our sellers, and to get buyers to come back to Etsy.com more often. We believe we can do a better job of integrating our performance marketing efforts with the efforts of our sellers to potentially unlock additional marketing synergies. In 2017, approximately 88% of our visits came to us through organic channels such as direct, search engine optimization, email, and push notifications, and we see an opportunity to optimize these free traffic sources. For example, we have been in the process of migrating our e-mail system to a new customer relationship management (“CRM”), system to allow us to send more personalized and targeted emails to buyers. We believe these efforts will allow Etsy to stay top of mind with buyers and encourage them to come back more frequently. Additionally, we continue to invest in marketing to drive higher return-on-investment (“ROI”) from our paid marketing efforts. Our largest paid marketing channel is digital acquisition marketing in which we invest primarily in Google product listing ads and search engine marketing.


• | Providing best-in-class Seller Services and tools: Finally, we seek to provide sellers with best-in-class paid Seller Services and free tools. These resources address the numerous administrative tasks that our sellers face while running their businesses and provide educational materials to help them capitalize on growth and efficiency opportunities. Throughout 2017, we introduced several new tools to help sellers run sales and promotions, offer free shipping, share their items on social media and assess the health and potential of their businesses. Leveraging our new sales and promotion tool, which allows sellers to create sales and run promotions for items in their shop, we held our first-ever site-wide sales over Labor Day and Cyber Monday, which gave buyers a reason to think of Etsy during additional shopping occasions.

Our Mission, Values, and Impact Strategy
Mission
Etsy’s mission to “Keep Commerce Human” is rooted in our belief that, although automation and commoditization are parts of modern life, human creativity cannot be automated and human connection cannot be commoditized. This is what makes Etsy and our marketplace distinct from mass retailers. Our mission guides our daily decisions, sets the path for our long-term success and reinforces our commitments to a positive social, economic and environmental impact.
Values
Etsy's values help ensure that our actions align with our mission and define our expectations, behaviors and accountability towards one another, our community and our stakeholders. We are conducting a review process to ensure that our values continue to meet these ideals. Our current values are:
We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. To demonstrate our commitment, we monitor our efforts to minimize the harm and maximize the benefit that we have on people and the planet and then publish an annual Progress Report to publicly report our results.
We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. Our ecosystem consists of Etsy and the people and communities around the world who benefit from our platform. 
We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that members of our community use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers.
We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment and purpose is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful.
We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. When we believe that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to change course.
Impact Strategy
Etsy’s impact strategy focuses on leveraging Etsy’s core business to generate value for our community and stakeholders through positive economic, social and environmental efforts.We believe that aligning our impact strategy with our core business will lead to positive outcomes. We aim to create more economic opportunity for sellers, greater diversity in our workforce and build long-term resilience by reducing our carbon footprint. We believe that consumers are demanding more of the businesses they support and that the companies best positioned to succeed will build win-win solutions that are good for people, the planet and profit.The alignment of our mission, values, and impact strategy alongside our business strategy is critical to growing sustainably and positioning us for continued success.
11

For 2018, we have set key performance indicators (“KPIs”) in order to measure our impact progress.
Our Team
We pride ourselves on our action-oriented, values-based and purpose-driven work culture. Etsy’s employees work hard to bring innovative ideas and energy every day to strengthen the experience for sellers and buyers on Etsy.com. As of December 31, 2017, we had 744 employees worldwide, with 452 employees located in our headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. Of those employees, we had 237 in engineering, 97 in product, 161 in member operations, 102 in marketing and 147 in facilities, IT and other corporate teams.
We focus on maximizing our employees’ engagement, and their professional and personal well-being.
We believe employee engagement comes from fulfilling work focused on serving the needs of our sellers and buyers and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching, skills workshops and training. We also offer our employees paid time off to volunteer so that they can support the causes and organizations they are passionate about. In 2016, we introduced a 26-week gender-blind parental leave policy that is available to all Etsy employees globally. Through this policy we aim to support and enable parents to play equal roles in building successful companies and nurturing their families. 
Etsy engineering is widely known for its thought-leading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture. Our engineering team coined the phrase “Code as Craft” to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship. We believe our engineers have the skills, practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings.
We believe that a diverse workforce makes us a better company, and we strive to create opportunities for underrepresented groups to join, thrive and advance at Etsy. As part of our impact strategy, we have implemented new recruiting guidelines that are intended improve diversity at all levels of our company. As of December 31, 2017, 55% of employees identified as women. As of December 31, 2017, 60% of managers and 38% of product, engineering and technical operations employees identified as women. We are committed to improving the diversity within our workforce, and we publish an annual report that details our progress toward this goal.
12

Competition
We compete for Etsy sellers with both retailers and companies that sell software to small businesses. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces, including through commerce channels on social networks like Facebook and Instagram. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for Etsy sellers based on our brand awareness, the global scale of our marketplace and the breadth of our online presence, the number and engagement of Etsy buyers, our Seller Services, our seller education resources and tools, our policies and fees, our mobile apps, the strength of our community and our values.
We also compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. We are able to compete for Etsy buyers based on the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace, our brand awareness, the person-to-person commerce experience, our reputation as a trusted marketplace, our mobile apps, ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and to a lesser extent patent laws, in the United States and abroad, and we use confidentiality procedures, defensive licensing, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect Etsy and our intellectual property.
While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. We file patents and register domain names, trademarks, copyrights and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also rely upon unregistered copyrights and common law protection for certain trademarks.
Government Regulation
As with any company operating on the internet, we are subject to a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently changing. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S. federal and state laws, E.U. directives and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country. The growing regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on Etsy sellers and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-corruption and export control laws.
