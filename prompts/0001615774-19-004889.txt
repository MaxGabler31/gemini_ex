On January 18, 2014, Your Hometown Deli was formed under the laws of State of New Jersey. On May 29, 2014, Your Hometown Deli entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with the Company and is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company. We introduced the delicatessen concept under the Your Hometown Deli brand name. Based on the Paulsboro unit’s performance, we may consider expanding the concept to other communities throughout the United States.
 
The Company is the originator of a new “Delicatessen” concept called “Your Hometown Deli.” Your Hometown Delis features “home-style” sandwiches, food items, and groceries in a casual and friendly atmosphere. Your Hometown Delis are designed to be comfortable community gathering places for customers of all ages. The Company seeks to create an establishment that will appeal to local residents and commuting workers, conveniently offering high-quality products at fair prices. Targeted towards smaller towns and communities, the Company’s first location was opened in Paulsboro, New Jersey on October 14, 2015.
 
The Your Hometown Deli Concept
 
Your Hometown Deli is a delicatessen concept that will focus on providing high-quality food products not available in local supermarkets or take-out restaurants. The delicatessen concept has a worldwide history with the term first appearing in the English language in 1889. The word “delicatessen” originates in the German language and means “delicacies” or “fine foods.” Delicatessens vary throughout the world, but in the United States a delicatessen (or “deli”) is a small retail store that is a blend of a grocery and a fast-food restaurant.
 
The Company’s Your Hometown Deli concept is patterned after traditional delicatessens, offering a wider and fresher menu than found at fast-food restaurants. Sandwiches and green salads are made fresh to order. Like many delis, Your Hometown Deli serves some hot foods kept on a steam table, similar to a cafeteria. In addition to ready-to-eat food, the Your Hometown Deli sells cold cuts by weight. A wide variety of beverages are also sold together with potato chips and similar products.
 
In addition to our food offering, newspapers, limited household items and small snack items, such as candy, cookies and chewing gums are planned to be available for purchase. Your Hometown Deli also provides take-out service and limited seating in the store.
 
We have begun generating revenue from the sales of our food and beverage since our soft opening in mid-October, 2015. Besides the equipment, fixtures, and inventories we purchased for our deli store, we have limited assets. We had minimal working capital as of the date of this annual report and used cash in operating activities for the year then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt from our auditor about our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We have limited advertising using social media and direct mailing to residents in towns around our store, however, we recently placed an advertisement in a local high school sports calendar and have attended various local events with food samples and menus. We have attended events like the Lighthouse Challenge held at Tinicum Rear Range Lighthouse and various political fundraisers throughout Gloucester County. We expect our losses to continue during 2019 as we continue to revise our menu and marketing plan to the local taste.

Products
 
Your Hometown Deli provides sandwiches, soups, salads, deli meats/cheeses, hot/cold drinks, fresh breads/rolls and small retail items for cooking, baking, and home use. Salads include made-to-order green salads, prepared pasta, potato, chicken, or other variety of “wet” salads. Breakfast products include baked goods (breakfast pastries, bagels, toast), yogurt, and hot breakfast sandwiches. Fresh coffee, tea and other hot and cold beverages are also available for purchase.
Strategy
 
The Company’s business strategy is to create a food-centered social environment within the local community that offers higher-quality prepared food and ingredients than is typically found locally. The Company’s management believes that broader market trends and certain locality-specific attributes support this strategy. The average American eats out 4-5 times a week and according to the United States Department of Labor. Management of the Company believes the increased popularity of eating out in the United States is a social trend that is likely to continue in the future. In addition, if capital is available, management will select additional Your Hometown Deli locations that appear to support this strategy.
Location
 
The Company’s first location is in Paulsboro, a borough in Gloucester County, New Jersey that was founded in 1904. Paulsboro is located directly across the Delaware River from the city of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia airport. Your Hometown Deli is located on a property in the commercial area of downtown Paulsboro that has two adjacent buildings. The front building is the location of Your Hometown Deli and New Jersey’s Got Talent office. The rear building is used throughout the week as a practice facility by the local wrestling club and other sports groups. Paulsboro has a national reputation for its wrestling activities and one of the Company’s founders is a leader in the sport of wrestling.
 
The borough of Paulsboro is undergoing a redevelopment phase from a petroleum products specialty port into an adaptable “OmniPort” able to handle a diversity of bulk, break bulk cargo and shipping containers. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that the port is well suited to become a center for the manufacturing, assembly, and transport of wind turbines and platforms for the development of Atlantic Wind Connection. The port is located approximately one mile from the site of the Your Hometown Deli. The Company’s management believes that hundreds of employees around the area will eventually pass the Your Hometown Deli, the only food establishment on the main commuter route to the Port.
 
The Market
 
The local Paulsboro market is small, but conducive to hosting a Your Hometown Deli. According to the 2010 United States Census, there were 6,097 people and 2,286 households residing in the borough. The median household income was $43,846. The broader Philadelphia Metropolitan Statistical Area is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States with a population to 6.53 million people.
 
The Company anticipates drawing customers from people living in Paulsboro and the adjacent communities of Greenwich, Clarksboro, and West Deptford, New Jersey. Commuting workers are also anticipated to be customers.
 
New Jersey's Got Talent recently leased space on our property which creates another group of potential customers. NJGT is a school of performing arts specializing in vocal, dance and acting lessons.
 
Local students and coaches who frequently use the sports practice facility adjacent to our property are another group of potential customers. The practice facility is also home to the “The Monster Factory,” a professional wrestling training and wrestling match promotions organization. In business more than 30 years, the Monster Factory has become “the world’s most famous wrestling school” and has been featured in the Rolling Stone, NewsWeek, and Wall Street Journal. The Company believes that the attendees of Monster Factory wrestling events are potential customers for Your Hometown Deli.
 
Local competing delicatessen concept stores include Wally’s Grocery & Deli. Other dining and grocery options in the area include locally owned pizzerias, seafood, and fine dining restaurants. Fast food options in the vicinity include McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy’s. Grocery stores include Wawa, Dollar General, Heritage’s Dairy Stores and Fair Deal Food Market.

Employees
 
The Company presently has four part-time employees apart from its officers and directors, Paul F. Morina, President and Christine T. Lindenmuth, Vice President. Both are currently working for the Company without any compensation. From time to time, the Company may hire more employees based on its business needs and these decisions will be made by the officers if and when appropriate.
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company relies heavily on word of mouth for its marketing. The Company’s founders have close ties to the community in which the first store is located in and Company believes that these relationships will help the Company’s sales and marketing efforts. A portion of the Company’s marketing budget is allocated to be spent on signage and other forms of local advertising. Social media is also used to describe the quality, atmosphere, products, specials, customer opinions and general information about the Your Hometown Deli’s operation. All sales and marketing messages will attempt to describe the unique character of the Your Hometown Deli and its family-oriented style and old-world feel. 
Seasonality
 
We do not have a seasonal business cycle. However, we may offer seasonal food items or adjust our menu items depending on the seasons.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not hold any patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property on products relating to our business except that we have a Facebook page. However, from time to time, we may apply for patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the protection of our brand and success of our business.
