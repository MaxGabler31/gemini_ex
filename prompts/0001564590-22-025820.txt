ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 As used in this document, the terms “Culp,” the “company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Culp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (unless the context indicates another meaning). The term “common stock” means the common stock of Culp, Inc., par value $.05 per share. The terms “Read Window Products” and “Read” refer to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Read Window Products, LLC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the company sold its majority ownership interest in eLuxury, LLC (“eLuxury”), resulting in the elimination of the company’s home accessory segment at the time of such sale. Accordingly, the results of operations for this segment are excluded from the company’s continuing operations for the fiscal 2020 year and all prior periods of comparison, and the financial results are presented as a discontinued operation in the company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 Overview
 Culp manufactures, sources, and markets mattress fabrics and sewn covers used for covering mattresses and foundations and other bedding products; and upholstery fabrics, including cut and sewn kits, primarily used in the production of upholstered furniture. The company competes in a business driven by fashion and product performance, and we strive to differentiate ourselves by placing a sustained focus on product innovation and creativity. In addition, we place great emphasis on providing excellent and dependable service to our customers. Our focused efforts to protect our financial strength have allowed us to maintain our position as a financially stable and trusted supplier of innovative fabrics to bedding and furniture manufacturers.
 We believe Culp is the largest producer of mattress fabrics in North America and one of the largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture in North America, measured by total sales. Our operations are classified into two operating segments — mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics. The mattress fabrics business markets primarily knitted and woven fabrics, as well as sewn covers made from those fabrics, which are used in the production of bedding products, including mattresses, foundations, and mattress sets. The upholstery fabrics business markets a variety of fabric products that are used principally in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture, including sofas, recliners, chairs, loveseats, sectionals, sofa-beds, and office seating, as well as window treatment products and installation services for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries. 
 Culp markets a variety of fabrics and other products in different categories to a global customer base, including fabrics produced at our manufacturing facilities and fabrics produced by other suppliers. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had active production facilities located in North Carolina; Tennessee; Quebec, Canada; Shanghai, China; and Ouanaminthe, Haiti. We also source fabrics and cut and sewn kits from other manufacturers, located primarily in China, Vietnam, and Turkey, with substantially all of these products made specifically for Culp and created by Culp designers. In addition, we operate distribution centers in North Carolina, Canada, China, and Haiti to facilitate distribution of our fabric products, with additional distribution capabilities through strategic relationships in China and Vietnam.
 Over the past decade, the portion of total company sales represented by fabrics produced outside of the U.S. and Canada has increased, while sales of goods produced in the U.S. have decreased. This trend is related primarily to the upholstery fabrics segment, where substantially all of our sales now consist of fabrics produced in Asia. The mattress fabrics business remains primarily based in North America. 
 Total net sales in fiscal 2022 were $294.8 million. The mattress fabrics segment had net sales of $152.2 million (52% of total net sales), and the upholstery fabrics segment had net sales of $142.6 million (48% of total net sales). 
 Our overall sales declined 1.6% during fiscal 2022, as compared to the prior year, with mattress fabric sales decreasing 3.5% and upholstery fabric sales increasing 0.4%. This decline was driven primarily by the significant drop in sales for both businesses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which was mostly due to COVID-related shutdowns that affected our China operations, weakness in domestic mattress industry sales, and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in new business for the residential home furnishings industry. The decline in overall sales for the year was partially offset by certain pricing and freight surcharge actions that were implemented at differing times during the year.   
 Overall, Culp faced a difficult business environment during fiscal 2022. Despite these challenges, our associates around the world continued to persevere and deliver exceptional services to our customers. Both the mattress fabrics segment and upholstery fabrics segment have continued to execute our product-driven strategy, and our company’s global manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, flexible supply chain, and focus on innovation have helped us meet the evolving needs of our customers. We have also continued to diversify our platform and expand our capacity with our new upholstery cut and sew operation in Haiti, which commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2022. In addition, we enhanced our focus on design creativity and innovation with the launch of our new innovation campus in High Point, North Carolina, during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

COVID-19 Impact and Business Response
 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. This declaration, along with the continued spread of the disease to other countries, including the United States and other countries in which we operate, prompted federal, state, and local governments throughout the world to take a variety of actions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders, temporary quarantines, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing measures, mandated closures of non-essential businesses, occupancy limits, and other safety measures. Due to government-mandated closure requirements near the end of March 2020, we shut down our facilities in Canada and Haiti for several weeks, and most of our customers, as well as retail stores in the United States and around the globe, were similarly shut down or operating at significantly reduced capacity.
 In response to the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took steps to help safeguard the health of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve, including implementing detailed cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, instituting temperature checks, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, suspending non-essential travel, restricting visitors, providing remote work opportunities where possible, and offering on-site vaccination clinics to our employees, their families, and the general public. We have continued to monitor and update these procedures, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) recommendations and other local laws and regulatory authorities, throughout the pandemic. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we also implemented several measures to preserve liquidity and reduce costs in response to the significant disruption and economic uncertainty, including making workforce adjustments to align with demand, implementing temporary salary reductions, eliminating the cash compensation paid to our board of directors, and proactively drawing down funds under our credit facilities to increase financial flexibility, among other measures. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, following a better-than-expected increase in demand as customers and retail stores began to reopen, we returned substantially all of our previously furloughed workers to meet this surge in demand. We also repaid all outstanding borrowings previously drawn under our credit facilities, ended temporary salary reductions, and restored the cash compensation paid to our board of directors. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, our sales recovered from the COVID-19 disruption with strong growth, driven by increased demand in the bedding industry and the residential home furnishings industry, combined with our ability to service this surge in demand through our global platform. We made several investments during the year that provided expanded capacity in our mattress fabrics business, including purchasing additional knit machines, completing construction of a second building for our Haiti sewn mattress cover operation, and acquiring the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in our Haiti sewn mattress cover platform from our joint venture partner. We also announced an additional expansion of our Haiti facilities to include a third building that would produce cut and sewn upholstery kits, primarily to support demand for an existing customer of the upholstery fabrics segment. Together, the actions taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and beyond helped us mitigate the initial financial impact of lower industry demand and shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that we were well-positioned to meet the needs of our customers as retail stores reopened and consumer demand for residential home furnishings surged during fiscal 2021.
 While the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread throughout the world during fiscal 2021, we did not experience additional shutdowns of our operations, or any material shutdowns of the operations of our suppliers, during the remainder of the year, following the initial shutdowns from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, during fiscal 2022, our upholstery fabrics business was materially affected by COVID-19 related shutdowns of our sourcing partners and customers in Vietnam throughout most of the second quarter, and our operations in China were shut down during the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which prevented us from shipping goods in both our residential upholstery fabrics business and our sewn mattress cover business. In addition to these shutdowns, COVID-19 disruption affected our business during fiscal 2022, as well as the business of our customers and suppliers, due to employee absenteeism and labor shortages, pandemic-related effects on the availability and pricing of freight and raw material costs, and pandemic-related constraints on our customers’ capacity due to supply chain disruption for non-fabric components.
 We continue to monitor and actively manage the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our operations. The ongoing duration of the disruption and the effect it will have on our financial operations in the near and long term remain unknown and depend on factors beyond our knowledge or control. The need for any future actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic largely depends on the spread of the virus, including new variants, in the jurisdictions in which our business, our suppliers, and our customers operate, along with the effectiveness and availability of vaccines; the status of government restrictions, directives and guidelines; the availability of workers and conditions for maintaining employee safety; global supply chain conditions; overall economic conditions and consumer confidence; the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and distribution channels; and consumer demand for our products, all of which are highly uncertain. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

Additional financial information about our operating segments can be found in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
 Mattress Fabrics. The mattress fabrics segment, also known as Culp Home Fashions, manufactures and markets mattress fabrics and sewn mattress covers to bedding manufacturers. These products include woven jacquard fabrics, knitted fabrics, and some converted fabrics. Culp Home Fashions has manufacturing facilities located in Stokesdale and High Point, North Carolina, and St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada. The division also sources products internally from Culp China, which is operated by our upholstery fabrics division, as well as from a supplier in Turkey, based on our own designs and production schedule. Additionally, Culp Home Fashions has a mattress cover facility in Haiti (which is now a wholly-owned operation following the fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest from its former joint venture partner), and also utilizes our Culp China platform for the production of sewn mattress covers. Knitted fabrics are produced at both the Stokesdale and St. Jerome facilities, while jacquard (damask) fabric is produced solely at the St. Jerome facility. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, while the St. Jerome plant provides additional capacity and a second location for these processes. Both of these facilities offer finished goods distribution capabilities, and the Stokesdale plant houses the division offices.
 Culp Home Fashions had capital expenditures totaling $69 million during the past ten years, with especially high spending levels from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018. These expenditures provided for increased knit machine capacity, faster and more efficient weaving machines, and the capital required for commencement of our Haiti sewn mattress cover operation, while also allowing us to maintain our leading-edge technology through modernization and expansion projects. These capital expenditures also provided high technology finishing equipment for woven and knitted fabric and an enhanced U.S. platform for warehousing and distribution, along with a Canadian platform that now provides completely finished woven and knitted fabric.
 Our sewn mattress cover operation, established during fiscal 2013, has a manufacturing plant in High Point, North Carolina. This facility is leased by the company, and its operation involves a limited capital investment in equipment. In fiscal 2017, in response to continued growth in mattress cover demand, we entered into a joint venture with a third-party mattress cover provider to construct a second leased location for our mattress cover operations in Haiti, and that joint-venture facility began production of mattress covers for our business during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We completed a 40,000-square foot expansion of this Haiti facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase capacity, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in this Haiti mattress cover business from our previous joint venture partner, giving us full control over the operation. We expect this strategic acquisition will enhance our ability to effectively manage our global cut and sew platform by further expanding our capacity and improving our flexibility to meet customer demand from this near-shore operation. As noted above, we also utilize our Culp China platform, operated by our upholstery fabrics division, to manufacture sewn mattress covers and to source additional sewn covers from third-party suppliers in Asia. These three manufacturing locations in North Carolina, Haiti, and 
 4

China give us an on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy that allows us greater flexibility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers.
During the past five years, we completed several multi-year capital projects for the mattress fabrics business, including consolidating certain operations, expanding capacity, improving efficiency and customer service, and maintaining our flexible approach to fabric sourcing. In fiscal 2019, we continued these initiatives by consolidating our weaving operations to one facility, our plant in Quebec, Canada, and expanding production of our sewn mattress covers in Haiti and China to meet customer demand in the growing boxed bedding market. Additionally, we continued to expand our design capabilities in fiscal 2019, launching new software and a library system for cataloguing our products to drive marketing and enhance innovation. In fiscal 2020, we further enhanced our design and innovation platform by establishing a dedicated innovation team to develop and offer the latest technologies and forward-looking products, expanding our creative team to complement our innovation strategy, and releasing a new digital library, design simulations, and 3D image rendering capabilities to showcase our designs and marketing tools. We were able to leverage these new technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the face of travel restrictions and cancelled tradeshows, to continue showcasing our products and support our customers through virtual design collaboration. In fiscal 2021, we invested in additional knit machines and other equipment to expand fabric capacity in North America. We also enhanced our digital project management platform, which allows us to work with customers from concept ideation and 3D mapping to product life cycle management and final merchandising. In fiscal 2022, we expanded our leading-edge technology at our Canadian manufacturing facility with the addition of a sectional warper and lamination line.
 After eight consecutive years of growth, sales declined in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. The decline in fiscal 2019 was mainly attributable to the acceleration of low-priced mattress imports from China towards the end of fiscal 2018 and through the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, together with the increased acceptance by consumers of roll-packed/boxed bedding delivered through major online e-commerce channels. This disrupted the U.S. bedding industry and resulted in a decline in sales for domestic bedding manufacturers, which affected our business as a supplier to those manufacturers. Fiscal 2019 was also affected by major customer and retail disruption for certain of our core customers. The decline in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic during the fourth quarter, which has traditionally experienced higher sales for the mattress fabrics segment due to early spring seasonality trends. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, our results for fiscal 2020 were also affected by continued disruption in the domestic mattress industry relating to low-priced mattress imports that moved from China to other countries. 
 Sales increased significantly in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, which was materially affected by the COVID-19 disruption. This increase in sales was driven by the consumer focus on the home environment and overall comfort, combined with our ability to service this demand through our global platform. For fiscal 2022, sales declined compared to the prior year primarily due to industry weakness in domestic mattress industry sales, especially during the fourth quarter, along with some disruption from COVID-related shutdowns. This industry softness was driven by slowing retail demand, which we believe was mostly caused by inflationary pressures affecting consumer spending.  
 Despite the challenging macro-economic conditions during fiscal 2022, we maintained a continued focus on our product-driven strategy, with an emphasis on innovation, design creativity, quality, and personalized customer service. The strength and flexibility of our global manufacturing and sourcing operations in the U.S., Canada, Haiti, Asia, and Turkey enabled us to support the evolving needs of our mattress fabric and cover customers throughout the year. While we experienced lower demand in our mattress cover business, particularly during the second half of the year, we believe our on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy, as well as our fabric-to-cover model, remains a preferred platform for sewn mattress cover customers. We believe the success of our mattress fabrics segment over the long term is due to our focus on these foundational values and strategic initiatives that allow us to meet changing customer demands.
 Upholstery Fabrics. The upholstery fabrics segment markets fabrics for residential and commercial furniture, including jacquard woven fabrics, velvets, micro denier suedes, woven dobbies, knitted fabrics, piece-dyed woven products, and polyurethane “leather look” fabrics. With the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, this segment also markets window treatment products and installation services, including roller shades, drapery, hardware, and top-of-mattress soft goods, for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.
 The upholstery fabrics segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China. We market cut and sewn fabric kits produced in these locations, as well as a variety of upholstery fabrics and cut and sewn kits sourced from third party producers, mostly in China and Vietnam. Our China facilities in Shanghai include production of cut and sewn kits made to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers using sourced fabrics, as well as design, finishing, warehousing, quality control, and inspection operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we also commenced operation of a new facility in Haiti dedicated to the production of cut and sewn fabric kits, and we continued to ramp up production at this facility during the fourth quarter. This facility primarily supports demand for an existing upholstery fabrics customer. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to sell our upholstery fabrics products in countries other than the U.S., including the Chinese local market. Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.  
 Our upholstery fabrics business has moved from one that relied on a large fixed capital base that is difficult to adjust to a more flexible and scalable marketer of upholstery fabrics that meets changing levels of customer demand and tastes. At the same time, we have 
 5

maintained control of the most important “value added” aspects of our business, such as design, finishing, quality control, and logistics. This strategic approach has allowed us to limit our investment of capital in fixed assets and control the costs of our products, while continuing to leverage our design and finishing expertise, industry knowledge, and important relationships.
 After increasing in the two prior years, sales declined in fiscal 2020 due to the severe disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic during the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2021, our sales recovered with strong growth, driven by increased industry demand in our residential business, as well as the benefits of product innovation and opportunities with new and existing customers.  This growth was partially offset by lower sales for our hospitality business, which remained under pressure due to pandemic-related disruptions affecting the travel and leisure industries. During fiscal 2022, sales increased slightly by 0.4%, reflecting generally solid demand for residential upholstery products for the first nine months of the year, offset by a significant drop in residential sales during the fourth quarter due to COVID-related shutdowns of our facilities in China throughout the month of April and, to a lesser extent, a slowdown in new business for the residential home furnishings industry during the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales during fiscal 2022 also reflects the impact of certain pricing and freight surcharge actions that were implemented at varying time during the year.
 Throughout fiscal 2022, we maintained our sustained focus on product innovation, and our highly durable, stain resistant LiveSmart® performance fabrics, as well as our LiveSmart Evolve® performance plus sustainability fabrics, remained popular with both existing and new residential furniture customers. Our hospitality business continued to recover from pandemic-related impacts, with higher sales in our hospitality/contract fabric business and our Read business during the second half of the year. 
 We believe the success of our upholstery fabrics segment over the longer term is due largely to a business strategy that has included: 1) innovation in a low-cost environment, 2) speed-to-market execution, 3) consistent quality, 4) reliable service and lead times, and 5) increased recognition of and reliance on the Culp brand. Our progress has been achieved through a unique business model that has enabled the upholstery fabrics segment to execute a strategy that we believe is clearly differentiated from our competitors. In this way, we have maintained our ability to provide furniture manufacturers with products from nearly every category of fabric for upholstered furniture and meet continually changing demand levels and consumer preferences. In recent years, we have implemented additional steps to grow net sales, including an emphasis on markets beyond residential furniture, such as the hospitality market. One result of these efforts was the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, representing a significant expansion of our production capabilities in the hospitality market, along with the addition of window treatment installation services.
 Overview of Industry and Markets
 Culp markets products primarily to manufacturers and hospitality customers in three principal markets. The mattress fabrics segment supplies the bedding industry, which produces mattress sets (mattresses, box springs, foundations and top of bed components) and bedding accessory products. The upholstery fabrics segment primarily supplies the residential furniture industry and, to a lesser extent, the commercial furniture industry. The residential furniture market includes upholstered furniture sold to consumers for household use, including sofas, sofa-beds, chairs, recliners, and sectionals. The commercial furniture, fabrics, and window treatments market includes fabrics and window treatment products used in the hospitality industry (primarily hotels and motels); fabrics used for upholstered office seating and modular office systems sold primarily for use in offices and other institutional settings, as well as commercial textile wall coverings; and window treatments for commercial application. The principal industries into which the company sells products – the bedding industry and residential and commercial furniture industry – are described in more detail below. Currently, a great majority of our products are sold to manufacturers for end use in the U.S., and thus the discussions below are focused on that market.
 Overview of Bedding Industry
 The bedding industry has contracted and expanded in recent years in accordance with the general economy, although traditionally the industry has been relatively mature and stable. This is due in part to the fact that a majority of bedding industry sales are replacement purchases, which are less volatile than sales based on economic growth and new household formations. During fiscal 2022, the bedding industry experienced weakness in domestic mattress industry sales, particularly during the second half of the year, due primarily to inflationary pressures affecting consumer spending, especially for mattress products in the low to mid-range price points. These pressures are expected to continue affecting the bedding industry during fiscal 2023. 
 Until recently, the U.S. bedding industry has largely remained a North American-based business, with limited competition from imports. This dynamic has mainly been due to short lead times demanded by mattress manufacturers and retailers, the customized nature of product lines, the relatively low direct labor content in mattresses, and strong brand recognition. Imports of bedding into the U.S. had been increasing gradually, but this trend significantly accelerated in fiscal 2018 and 2019, especially for lower-priced bedding. China accounted for the largest share of the imported units during these years, but the level of mattress imports entering the U.S. from China began to substantially decline beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 in connection with punitive anti-dumping duties imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the level of mattress imports from other countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, among others, significantly increased during fiscal 2020 as imports from China declined. The result of the increase in imports during this period, and continuing into fiscal 2021, was a decline in sales for the major U.S. bedding manufacturers, which affected major suppliers to those manufacturers, including Culp.
 6

As a result of the continued significant influx of low-priced imports that moved from China to other countries, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping duties against seven countries, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Serbia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam, during fiscal 2021. We believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from these duties during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022. 
 A key trend driving the bedding industry is the increased demand for roll-packed/compressed mattresses in both online and traditional sales channels, as consumer acceptance of boxed beds as a delivery mechanism continues to drive growth and increase market share for this product, increasing potential demand for sewn mattress covers. Another important trend is the increased awareness among consumers about the health benefits of better sleep, with an increased focus on the quality of bedding products and an apparent willingness on the part of consumers to upgrade their bedding. A further trend is the strong and growing emphasis on the design knitted or woven into mattress fabrics to appeal to the customer’s visual attraction and perceived value of the mattress on the retail floor, as well as in online sales channels and advertisements. Mattress fabric design efforts are based on current trends in home decor and fashion. Additionally, the growth in non-traditional sources for retail mattress sales, such as online e-commerce channels and wholesale warehouse clubs, has the potential to increase overall consumption of goods due to convenience and high traffic volume, which in turn results in higher turnover of product. Among fabric types, knitted fabrics have continued to increase in popularity. Knitted fabric was initially used primarily on premium mattresses, but these products are now being placed increasingly on mattresses at mid-range to lower retail price points.
 Overview of Residential and Commercial Furniture Industry
 Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which is subject to variations in the general economy, including current inflationary pressures affecting consumer spending, the continued economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other geopolitical events. Because purchases of furniture and bedding products are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products may be more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decline in our sales and earnings. 
 Sales of residential and commercial furniture are affected by variations in the global economy, including economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects. These market conditions, as well as the pace of recovery from these conditions, have been uneven in recent years. In general, sales of residential furniture are influenced significantly by the housing industry and by trends in home sales and household formations, while demand for commercial furniture generally reflects economic trends affecting businesses. During fiscal 2021, disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic positively affected sales trends, with the increased consumer focus on the home and travel restrictions shifting discretionary spending away from travel and leisure activities towards home furnishings and enhancing comfort within the home environment. This sales trend began to reverse during fiscal 2022, particularly during the second half of the year, as COVID-related travel and mask restrictions were lifted and consumers began to resume travel and leisure activities. Inflationary pressures also began to affect consumer spending during the second half of fiscal 2022. Together, these trends have caused a slowdown in new business for the residential home furnishings industry that is expected to continue during fiscal 2023.
 The sourcing of components and fully assembled furniture from overseas continues to play a major role in the furniture industry. By far, the largest source for these imports continues to be China. Imports of upholstery fabric, both in roll and in “kit” form, have also had a significant impact on the market for upholstery fabrics in recent years. Fabrics entering the U.S. from China and other low labor cost countries have resulted in increased price competition in the upholstery fabric and upholstered furniture markets.
 In general, the residential furniture industry has been consolidating for several years. The result of this trend is fewer, but larger, customers for marketers of upholstery fabrics. Intense price competition continues to be an important consideration for both residential and commercial furniture.
 Additionally, with the ongoing global trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs during fiscal 2019 and the possibility for additional tariffs on China imports, some of our customers began altering their supply chains away from China in late fiscal 2019. While this trend continued in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2022, we believe Asia remains a preferred location for sourcing of components, including fabric.
 Products
 As described above, our products include mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics, which are our two identified operating segments. These fabrics are sold in roll form and as sewn mattress covers by the mattress fabrics segment, and in roll form and as cut and sewn kits by the upholstery fabrics segment.  Our upholstery segment products also include window treatments and related products.  
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Mattress fabrics segment sales constituted 52% of our total net sales for fiscal 2022, compared with 53% for fiscal 2021.  The company has emphasized fabrics that have broad appeal at prices generally ranging from $1.50 to more than $10.00 per yard.

Suedes | Fabrics woven or knitted using microdenier polyester yarns, which are piece dyed and finished, usually by sanding. The fabrics are typically plain or small jacquard designs, with some being printed. These are sometimes referred to as microdenier suedes.
Faux leathers | Sueded or knitted base cloths which are overprinted with polyurethane, and composite products consisting of a base fabric that is coated with a top layer of polyurethane, which simulates the look and feel of leather. 
Cut and sewn kits | Covers made from various types of upholstery fabrics and cut and sewn to specifications of furniture manufacturing customers for use on specific furniture frames. 

 
With the acquisition of Read Window Products at the end of fiscal 2018, the upholstery fabrics business also markets a variety of window treatment products and installation services for customers in the hospitality and commercial industries.  These products include roller & solar shades, drapery, roman shades and top treatments, hardware products, and soft goods such as duvet covers, bed skirts, bolsters and pillows.
 Manufacturing and Sourcing
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Our mattress fabrics segment operates four manufacturing plants, with two located in North Carolina (Stokesdale and High Point), one in St. Jerome, Quebec, Canada, and one in Ouanaminthe, Haiti.  Over the past ten fiscal years, we made capital expenditures of approximately $69 million to consolidate our production facilities and to modernize both knit and weaving equipment, enhance and

provide knit and woven finishing capabilities, and expand capacity. The result has been an increase in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating costs, as well as expanded product offerings and capacity.
 Knitted fabrics are produced at both our Stokesdale facility and our St. Jerome plant, while production of jacquard mattress fabrics was consolidated into the St. Jerome facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. The majority of our finishing and inspection processes for mattress fabrics are conducted at the Stokesdale plant, with the St. Jerome plant providing additional capacity and a second location for these processes, along with distribution capabilities. We produce sewn mattress covers at our manufacturing facility in High Point, North Carolina, at our facility in Haiti, and at the manufacturing facilities of our Culp China platform in China. Our High Point facility is a leased space with limited capital investment in equipment. In fiscal 2017, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with a third party mattress cover provider to construct a second leased location for our mattress cover operations in Haiti, and this joint venture facility began production of mattress covers for our business during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We completed a 40,000-square foot expansion of this Haiti facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase capacity, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired the remaining fifty percent ownership interest in this Haiti mattress cover business from our previous joint venture partner, giving us full control of the operation. We expect this strategic acquisition will enhance our ability to effectively manage our global cut and sew platform by expanding our capacity and improving our flexibility to meet customer demand from this near-shore operation. Additionally, we utilize the company’s Culp China platform, operated by our upholstery fabrics division, to manufacture sewn mattress covers. These three manufacturing locations give us an on-shore, near-shore, and off-shore supply chain strategy that allows us greater agility in meeting demand for mattress covers from bedding producers. 
 In addition to the mattress fabrics and sewn covers manufactured by Culp, we have important supply arrangements in place that allow us to source mattress fabric and sewn covers from strategic suppliers. We source some Culp-designed knitted fabrics, certain converted fabric products, and sewn mattress covers using our Culp China platform. We also source Culp-designed sewn mattress covers from a strategic supply relationship in Vietnam. Additionally, we source a portion of our woven jacquard fabric and knitted fabric, which is obtained from a supplier located in Turkey, based on designs and a production schedule created by Culp. 
 Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The upholstery fabrics segment currently operates two manufacturing facilities in China. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we also commenced operation of a new facility in Haiti that is dedicated to the production of cut and sewn upholstery fabric kits.  Additionally, we fabricate a variety of window treatments, using mostly customer-supplied fabrics and materials, at our Read Window Products facility in Knoxville, Tennessee.  
 Our upholstery fabrics facilities in China are located within the same industrial area in Shanghai. At these facilities, we apply value-added finishing processes to fabrics sourced from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we inspect sourced fabric there as well. In addition, the Shanghai operations include facilities where sourced fabric is cut and sewn to provide kits that are designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by our customers.
 Our new upholstery fabrics operation in Haiti primarily supports demand for an existing upholstery fabrics customer. This facility uses sourced fabrics to produce cut and sewn kits designed to be placed on specific furniture frames designated by the customer.   
 A large portion of our upholstery fabric products, as well as certain elements of our production processes, are being sourced from outside suppliers. Our facilities in China provide a base from which to access a variety of products, including certain fabrics (such as micro denier suedes and polyurethane fabrics) that are not produced anywhere within the U.S. We have found opportunities to develop significant relationships with key overseas suppliers in China that allow us to source products on a cost-effective basis, while limiting our investment of capital in manufacturing assets. We source unfinished and finished fabrics, as well as a portion of our cut and sewn kits, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China who are willing to commit significant capacity to meet our needs while working with our product development team located in China to meet the demands of our customers.  Beginning in late fiscal 2019, we also developed strategic supplier relationships in Vietnam for additional sourcing of our cut and sewn kits, which has allowed us to begin adjusting our supply chains to meet customer demands in conjunction with ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China. The majority of upholstery fabrics and materials used by our Read Window Products business to fabricate window treatments are customer-supplied. These materials are generally sourced by customers, and we also source a portion of other window treatment products such as hardware and roller shades, from outside suppliers in the U.S., Turkey, and China.
 Product Design and Innovation
 Consumer tastes and preferences related to bedding, upholstered furniture, and window treatment products change over time. The use of new fabrics, creative designs, and special production finishes and technologies remains an important consideration for manufacturers and marketers to distinguish their products at retail and to capitalize on changes in preferred colors, patterns, textures, and performance properties. Culp’s success is largely dependent on our ability to market fabrics and products with appealing designs and patterns, as well as performance properties such as cleanability, stain-resistance, cooling, and sustainability. The process of developing new designs and innovative finishes involves maintaining an awareness of broad fashion and color trends, as well as wellness and other consumer trends, both in the United States and internationally.
 9

In order to enhance our design and innovation creativity and advance the synergies between our mattress fabrics and upholstery fabrics segments, we launched a new innovation campus in downtown High Point, North Carolina, during fiscal 2022. This space combines our design, innovation, and sales teams for both businesses into a shared location to support collaboration across divisions and pull our top creative talent together to develop new products and technologies based on the latest consumer trends.  
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Design innovation is a very important element of producing mattress fabrics. We invest significant resources to stay ahead of current design trends, including maintaining a trained and active design and innovation staff, investing in research and development activities such as participation in international design shows, and implementing systems for creating, cataloguing, and simulating new designs. Price point delineation for our fabrics and our customers’ finished mattress products is accomplished through fabric quality as well as variation in design. Consumers are drawn to the mattress that is the most visually appealing when walking into a retail showroom or viewing mattress products online, so this design variation, together with price point delineation, helps our customers merchandise different looks at various price points. Fiber differentiation also plays an important part in design. For example, rayon, organic cotton, and other special fibers, including recycled fibers promoting sustainability and fibers with cooling properties, are incorporated into the design process to allow the retailer to offer consumers additional benefits related to their sleeping experience. Similarly, many fabrics contain special production finishes that enhance fabric performance.
 Mattress fabric designs are not routinely introduced on a scheduled season. Designs are typically introduced upon the request of the customer as they plan introductions of new products. Additionally, we work closely with our customers on new design offerings around the major furniture markets such as Las Vegas, Nevada, and High Point, North Carolina.
 Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The company has developed an upholstery fabrics design and product development team (with staff located in the U.S. and in China) with a primary focus on value in designing body cloths, while promoting style leadership with pillow fabrics and color. Our design staff travels regularly to international trade and design shows to maintain familiarity with current design and fashion trends. The team searches continually for new ideas and for the best sources of raw materials, yarns, and fabrics, utilizing a supply network located mostly in China. Using these design elements, they develop product offerings using ideas and materials that take both fashion trends and cost considerations into account to offer products designed to meet the needs of furniture manufacturers and ultimately the desires of consumers.
 Upholstery fabric designs are introduced at major fabric trade conferences that occur twice a year in the United States (June and December). In recent years we have become more aggressive in registering copyrights for popular fabric patterns and taking steps to discourage the illegal copying of our proprietary designs.
 Distribution
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Most of our mattress fabrics shipments originate from our facilities in Stokesdale, North Carolina, and we have additional distribution capabilities in Canada, China, and Haiti. Through arrangements with major customers and in accordance with industry practice, we maintain a significant inventory of mattress fabrics at our distribution facility in Stokesdale (“make to stock”), so that products may be shipped to customers with short lead times and on a “just in time” basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 A majority of our upholstery fabrics are marketed on a “make to order” basis and are shipped directly from our distribution facilities in Burlington, North Carolina, and Shanghai, China. We also have distribution capabilities in Vietnam. In addition to “make to order” distribution, an inventory of select fabric patterns is held at our distribution facilities in Burlington and Shanghai from which our customers can obtain quick delivery of sourced fabrics through a program known as “Culp Express.” We also have distribution capabilities for our “Culp Express” program to local customers in Canada through our mattress fabrics distribution facility in Quebec, Canada. Window treatment products sold through our Read Window Products business are done on a “job order” basis, with manufactured products shipped directly from our manufacturing facility in Knoxville, Tennessee to the job installation site.  
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of mattress fabric production costs. The mattress fabrics segment purchases primarily synthetic yarns (polyester, polypropylene, and rayon), certain greige (unfinished) goods, glue adhesives, laminates, dyes, and other chemicals. Most of these materials are available from several suppliers, and prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, the general rate of inflation, and particularly on the price of petrochemical products. 
 10

The mattress fabrics segment has generally not had significant difficulty in obtaining raw materials. During fiscal 2022, some of our outside suppliers faced extended delays and increased costs for raw materials, as well as COVID-19-related disruption that affected production. Our use of outside suppliers to source materials to produce mattress fabric and sewn covers makes the mattress fabrics segment vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control.
 Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The upholstery fabrics segment generally does not purchase raw materials directly, but raw materials, particularly synthetic yarns (polyester, acrylic, rayon, and polypropylene) and dyes, are important to our suppliers of finished and unfinished fabrics. Raw materials account for approximately 60%-70% of upholstery fabric manufacturing costs for products the company manufactures. 
 Increased reliance by both our U.S. and China upholstery operations on outside suppliers for basic production needs such as base fabrics, yarns, and finishing services has caused the upholstery fabrics segment to become more vulnerable to price increases, delays, or production interruptions caused by problems within businesses that we do not control.
 Both Segments
 Many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our raw material costs can be sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. During fiscal 2021, our raw material costs were mostly flat or slightly down during the first three quarters, as compared to the prior year, but they began to escalate during the fourth quarter primarily due to rising oil prices, a higher demand environment, and labor shortages. These pressures continued during fiscal 2022, with further increases in raw material costs, particularly during the second half of the year, due to the continued rise in oil prices and a higher demand environment.   
Seasonality
 Overall, demand for our products generally depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including consumer confidence, unemployment rates, and housing market conditions. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the bedding and furniture industries, including manufacturers and retail stores, were adversely affected by closures/restricted operations, supply chain disruption, and economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. For the remainder of fiscal 2021, disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic positively affected sales trends, with the increased consumer focus on the home and travel restrictions shifting discretionary spending away from travel and leisure activities towards home furnishings and enhancing overall comfort within the home environment. However, this sales trend began to reverse during fiscal 2022, particularly during the second half of the year, as COVID-related travel and mask restrictions were lifted and consumers began to resume travel and leisure activities. Inflationary pressures also affected consumer spending during the second half of fiscal 2022. These impacts are not reflective of any seasonal trends in the bedding or furniture industries and are not an indicator that seasonal trends are changing for our business segments.
Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The mattress fabrics business and the bedding industry in general are slightly seasonal, with sales being the highest in early spring and late summer, with another peak in mid-winter. However, these seasonality trends relate more to in-store retail sales, whereas the growth in online sales, which began prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased during the pandemic, appear to be somewhat less seasonal.    
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 The upholstery fabrics business today is less seasonal than it once was. In the past, seasonality resulted from one-week closings of our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of most of our customers in the U.S. during our first and third fiscal quarters for the holiday weeks of July 4th and Christmas. This effect has become much less pronounced as the majority of our fabrics are produced or sold in locations outside of the U.S. The timing of the Chinese National Holiday in October and, to a larger extent, the Chinese New Year (which occurs in January or February each year), now have a more significant impact on upholstery sales than the U.S. holiday periods, often causing sales to be higher in advance of these Chinese holiday periods and sometimes lower during or immediately following the same periods.
Competition
 Competition for our products is high and is based primarily on price, design, quality, product performance, timing of delivery, and service.
 11

Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The mattress fabrics market is concentrated in a few relatively large suppliers, as well as some niche producers focusing mainly on knitted products. We believe our principal mattress fabric and mattress cover competitors are BekaertDeslee Textiles (fabric and mattress cover producer), Global Textile Alliance (fabric and mattress cover producer), and several smaller companies producing knitted fabrics, sewn covers, and other fabric, including companies in China supplying fabric and cover products to sub-contract manufacturers in the U.S. In addition, our bedding customers continue to face increasing competition from imports of finished beds, which indirectly compete with our mattress fabrics by replacing potential sales of our products to those customers. 
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 In the upholstery fabrics market, we compete against a large number of companies, ranging from a few large manufacturers comparable in size to the company to small producers and converters (companies who buy and re-sell fabrics, but have no manufacturing). We believe our principal upholstery fabric competitors are Dorell Fabrics Co., Morgan Fabrics, Richloom Fabrics, Specialty Textile, Inc. (or STI), and ZhongWang Fabrics, plus a large number of smaller competitors (both manufacturers and converters).
 The trend in the upholstery fabrics industry to greater overseas competition and the entry of more converters has caused the upholstery fabrics industry to become substantially more fragmented in recent years, with lower barriers to entry. This has resulted in a larger number of competitors selling upholstery fabrics, with an increase in competition based on price.
 Environmental and Other Regulations
 We are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and federal and state environmental laws, as well as similar laws governing our manufacturing facilities in China, Canada, and Haiti. We periodically review our compliance with these laws and regulations in an attempt to minimize the risk of violations.
 Our operations involve a variety of materials and processes that are subject to environmental regulation. Under current law, environmental liability can arise from previously owned properties, leased properties, and properties owned by third parties, as well as from properties currently owned and leased by the company. Environmental liabilities can also be asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation.
 In addition, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and analogous state statutes, liability can be imposed for the disposal of waste at sites targeted for cleanup by federal and state regulatory authorities. Liability under CERCLA is strict as well as joint and several.
 The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that greenhouse gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment. International agreements may also result in new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation. However, if enacted, this type of program could materially increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation, and electricity. It is difficult to predict the extent to which any new rules or regulations would affect our business, but we would expect the effect on our operations to be similar to that for other manufacturers, particularly those in our industry.
 We are periodically involved in environmental claims or litigation and requests for information from environmental regulators. Each of these matters is carefully evaluated, and the company provides for environmental matters based on information presently available. Based on this information, we do not currently believe that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on either the company’s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that the costs associated with environmental matters will not increase in the future.
 Human Capital
 Our Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2022, we employed 1,582 people, an increase of 152 employees as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year.  The mattress fabrics segments employed 945 people at fiscal year-end, a decrease of 48 employees, while the upholstery segment employed 603 people, an increase of 202 employees from the prior year. The increase in the number of employees in the upholstery fabrics segment in fiscal 2022, as compared to the prior year, was associated with opening of our new upholstery cut and sew facility in Haiti. The remaining employees comprise the company’s shared services functions. Approximately 537 employees work in the United States, and 1,045 are employed in international locations. We employ the vast majority of our employees on a full-time basis.
 12

The hourly employees at our manufacturing facility in Canada (approximately 10% of our workforce) are represented by a local, unaffiliated union. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees expires on February 1, 2023. We are not aware of any efforts to organize any more of our employees, and we believe our employee relations are very good with both our unionized and non-unionized workforce. Our companywide annual employee turnover rate was approximately 25% during the past fiscal year.
Mission Statement and Values
 Our human resources department has adopted a mission statement that embodies our values and goals in the company’s relationships with our employees. The mission statement is as follows:
 Culp HR Services is committed to providing outstanding employee support in a mutually respectful, safe, diverse, and collaborative environment through innovative programming that engages our associates and promotes the success of Culp, Inc.
 We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive workplace. Discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, genetic information, disability, veteran status, or other status protected by law, as well as sexual harassment or harassment of any kind, are not tolerated in our workplaces. Employees have multiple avenues available to report inappropriate behavior, including a dedicated “HR Connection” phone line. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated and appropriate action is taken to prevent their recurrence. We also prohibit retaliation against individuals who, in good faith, report any violation of company policies, including unlawful discrimination or harassment.
 Along with our mission statement and values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as conflicts of interest, fair dealing, protecting confidential information, appropriate use of company assets, compliance with laws (including, without limitation, anti-corruption and antitrust laws), workplace safety and environmental stewardship, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, ethical, and responsible manner, and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies. Our executive officers and supervisors maintain “open door” policies and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. 
 We also conduct regular training programs with our management and employee leaders to inform and refresh their knowledge about company policies and procedures pertaining to employment and human capital.
 Employee Recruitment, Development, Engagement, and Wellness
 We strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs that are aligned with those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located, and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. We also provide development opportunities that support career growth and maintain a wide variety of programs to engage with our employees and promote overall wellness. We believe these efforts support all of our personnel in the workplace and elsewhere in their lives, which in turn aids in our employee satisfaction and retention.
 For example, the “CULPgrow” program was launched in 2021 to provide employees with skills assessment and education assistance, such as GED, ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages), and computer literacy programs. The purpose of CULPgrow is to provide a workplace where every employee has the key resources they need to grow, develop, and reach their career goals. The program focuses on identifying the skills and goals of each employee, as well as ways the company can invest in their future and provide tools and resources that support their career advancement. It also provides resources such as financial educational assistance, as well as mentorship opportunities where employees can be matched with a company mentor and guided through pathways for success within the company.
 Additionally, in fiscal 2022, the company held its first company-wide global giving initiative, with a program called “Share the Love.” The program involved employees in each of our geographic locations choosing a charitable endeavor to support, based on their knowledge of local cultural considerations and areas of need. For example, our U.S. and Canadian locations held food drives for donations to local food banks, while Culp China’s facilities contributed to help cancer patients. Employees in Haiti made blankets in-house using Culp fabric and then donated them to a local orphanage and the local fire department.
 Other examples of employee engagement initiatives include:
 13

 
• | Monthly wellness sessions on various health-related topics, including a week of programs devoted to mental health during fiscal 2022
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Meetings and video chats with senior management
--+------------------------------------------------


• | The CulpVets program, which provides special recognition to military veterans
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employee awards and recognition programs
--+-----------------------------------------

 These engagement efforts and programs are continually refined and updated to meet the evolving needs of our workforce. 
 Safety and Health
 The safety and health of our employees is a fundamental priority at Culp. We maintain comprehensive safety monitoring and training programs, with regular reports to senior management on these topics. Our Behavior Based Safety initiative combines awareness programs, observation, and training to enhance continued compliance with safe and healthy practices in our facilities.
 Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive protocols were developed and followed to allow our manufacturing plants to reopen safely after mandatory shutdowns. When COVID-19 vaccines became available, we hosted vaccination clinics at several of our manufacturing facilities, providing access to vaccines not only for our employees, but also for their families and members of the local communities. Additional safety and health programs are planned for the future.

Sales are attributed to individual countries based upon the location that the company ships its products to for delivery to customers.
 For additional segment information, including the geographic location of long-lived assets, see Note 18 in the consolidated financial statements.
 Backlog
 Mattress Fabrics Segment
 The backlog for the mattress fabric segment is not a reliable predictor of future shipments because the majority of sales for the mattress fabrics segment are on a just-in-time basis.
Upholstery Fabrics Segment
 Although it is difficult to predict the amount of backlog that is “firm,” we have reported the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog from customers with confirmed shipping dates within five weeks of the end of the fiscal year. On May 1, 2022, the portion of the upholstery fabric backlog with confirmed shipping dates prior to June 6, 2022, was $15.7 million, compared with $17.2 million as of the end of fiscal 2021 (for confirmed shipping dates prior to June 7, 2021). 
Intellectual Property
 We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries. We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business, and we seek to diligently protect, monitor, and defend, through appropriate action, against their unauthorized use.
