Recent Sunset Acquisition



On January 31, 2022, the first day of our 2023 fiscal year, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Sunset HWM, LLC (“Sunset West”) and its three members (the “Sunset West Members”) to acquire substantially all of the assets of Sunset West (the “Sunset Acquisition”). Simultaneously, we closed on the transaction by paying $23.5 million in cash and $2 million subject to an escrow arrangement and possible earn-out payments to the Sunset West Members up to an aggregate of $4 million with the closing cash consideration subject to adjustment for customary working capital estimates. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company also assumed specified liabilities of Sunset West.



Sunset West is a leading West Coast-based manufacturer of outdoor furniture with its headquarters in Vista, California. The transaction enables us to immediately gain market share in the growing outdoor furniture segment of the industry with one of the most respected brands in the category. For more information regarding the Sunset Acquisition, please see Note 20 Subsequent Events to our Consolidated Financial Statements on page F-31.

Sourcing



Imported Products



We have sourced products from foreign manufacturers for over thirty years, predominantly from Asia. Imported casegoods and upholstered furniture together accounted for approximately 82% in fiscal 2022 and 83% of our net sales in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.



Our imported furniture business is subject to inherent risks in importing products manufactured abroad, including, but not limited to, supply disruptions and delays due to a variety of reasons, including our foreign suppliers’ factory capacities, factory shutdowns, and delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and possible similar health-related issues, much higher ocean freight costs, container and vessel space availability, currency exchange rate fluctuations, economic and political developments and instability, as well as the laws, policies and actions of foreign governments and the United States. These laws, policies and actions may include regulations affecting trade or the application of tariffs, much like the 25% tariff on certain goods imported into the United States from China, including almost all furniture and furniture components manufactured in China since fiscal 2019. In response to these tariffs, we began re-sourcing products from non-tariff countries, primarily Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, and reduced our Chinese imports to less than 15% by the end of fiscal 2022.



Because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign suppliers from which we source our imported products, we have flexibility in the sourcing of products among any particular supplier or country. However, a disruption in our supply chain from a major supplier or from Vietnam, China, or Malaysia in general, could significantly compromise our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country. Supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for six months or longer. If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at a comparable cost, a disruption in our supply chain from a major furniture supplier, or from Vietnam, China, or Malaysia in general, could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity.



In the summer of calendar 2021, many of our Vietnam and Malaysia suppliers were temporarily closed or operating at reduced capacity due to a COVID-19-related lockdown and did not fully resume until after the Lunar New Year holidays in calendar 2022. Slower-than expected re-openings and delays at the factories, along with constrained container and steamship availability, negatively impacted shipments and sales at our Home Meridian segment and the inventory levels at our Hooker Branded segment, which resulted in out-of-stock issues and decreased sales. Additionally, port congestion has led to delays in unloading furniture once it reaches U.S. ports. All of these factors, combined with the production halt that regularly occurs at the Lunar New Year holidays, have significantly lengthened the time it takes to ship and receive goods and our order backlog is at historic levels.



Given the sourcing capacity available in Vietnam, China, Malaysia and other low-cost producing countries, we currently believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable; however, we have limited insight into the extent to which our business could be further impacted by COVID-19 and there are many unknowns including, how long we will be impacted, the severity of the impacts and the probability of a recurrence of COVID-19 or similar regional or global pandemics. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information on our risks related to imported products.

For imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for a term of at least one year. However, under certain circumstances, we may re-negotiate pricings during the year. During fiscal 2022, due to the global supply chain crisis and inflation pressure in Asia and the U.S., we were forced to re-negotiate prices multiple times during the year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements during these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. We generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effects of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products. However, these price changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during the affected periods. Conversely, a relative increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to the currencies from which we obtain our imported products could decrease the cost of imported products and favorably impact net sales and profit margins during the affected period. However, due to other factors, such as inflationary pressure in China and other countries, we may not fully realize savings when exchange rates fall. Therefore, lower exchange rates may only have a tempering effect on future price increases by merely delaying cost increases on imported products. See also Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”



Raw Materials



Significant materials used in manufacturing our domestic upholstered furniture products include leather, fabric, foam, wooden and metal frames and electronic mechanisms. Most of the leather is imported from Italy, South America and China, and is purchased as full hides and cut and sewn in our facilities or is purchased as pre-cut and sewn kits processed by our vendors to our pattern specifications. We believe our sources for raw materials are adequate and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. Our five largest domestic upholstery suppliers accounted for 32% of our raw materials purchases for domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations in fiscal 2022. In the first half of fiscal 2022, we experienced shortages of foam which had a short-term but material impact on production levels, sales volume and operating efficiencies for that same period. Should disruptions with these suppliers occur, other than macro disruptions affecting all such suppliers, we believe we could successfully source these products from other suppliers without significant disruption to our operations. For example, as of the date of this report, our SFI division is in the process of re-sourcing Russian Birch plywood as a result of possible tariffs and lack of availability due to the current conflict in Ukraine.
Customers



Our home furnishings products are sold through a variety of retailers including independent furniture stores, department stores, mass merchants, national chains, catalog merchants, interior designers, e-commerce retailers and warehouse clubs. No single customer accounted for more than 8% of our consolidated sales in fiscal 2022. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 26% of our fiscal 2022 consolidated sales. The loss of any one or more of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business. Roughly 2% of our sales in fiscal 2022 were to international customers. We define sales to international customers as sales to customers outside of the United States and Canada since our independent domestic sales force services both countries.
Competition



The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, none of which dominates the market in our price points. While the markets in which we compete include a large number of relatively small and medium-sized manufacturers, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do. U.S. imports of furniture produced overseas, such as from Vietnam and China, have stabilized in recent years. The primary competitive factors for home furnishings in our price points include price, style, availability, service, quality and durability. Competitive factors in the hospitality and contract furniture markets include product value and utility, lead times, on-time delivery and the ability to respond to requests for special and non-standard products. We believe our design capabilities, ability to import and/or manufacture upholstered furniture, product value, longstanding customer and supplier relationships, significant sales, distribution and inventory capabilities, ease of ordering, financial strength, experienced management and customer support are significant competitive advantages.
Warehousing and Distribution 



We distribute furniture to retailers directly from factories and warehouses in Asia via our container direct programs and from our distribution centers in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and California, and in limited cases, from customer operated warehouses in strategic locations. We are in the process of consolidating our Home Meridian segment’s North Carolina warehousing operations into an 800,000 square foot distribution center in Liberty County, Georgia, which we occupied in the Fall of 2021. We believe that this strategically located facility near the Port of Savannah and major interstate highways will allow us to more efficiently service our customers, reduce transportation costs and better position us for future growth.

Working Capital Practices



Inventory: We generally import casegoods inventory and certain upholstery items in amounts that enable us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, our internal in-stock goals and minimum purchase requirements from our sourcing partners.



In the summer of calendar 2021, factories in Vietnam and Malaysia were temporarily closed due to COVID-related lockdown. Slower than expected re-openings and factory delays led to low inventory receipts in the second half of the year in Hooker Branded segment, which ships the majority of its products from U.S. warehouses to customers. Additionally, container availability and steamship capacity continued to be challenging. We expect these conditions to improve as we move through the second quarter of fiscal 2023.



Most of the Hooker Branded segment’s products are shipped from our US warehouses, while a large percentage of products sold at our Home Meridian segment are not warehoused by us but ship directly to our customers and thus not included as inventory. However, Home Meridian’s warehoused inventory increased $7 million as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased inventory in Home Meridian’s Accentrics Home division. Generally, our domestic upholstery segment products are made to order and shipped shortly after they are produced; however, due to the domestic truck driver shortage, shipments of this segment’s finished goods slowed somewhat in fiscal 2022. We do not carry significant amounts of hospitality products, as most of these products are built to order and are shipped shortly after their manufacture.



Accounts receivable: Substantially all of our trade accounts receivable are due from retailers and dealers that sell residential home furnishings or commercial purchasers of our hospitality and senior living products, which consist of a large number of entities with a broad geographic dispersion. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. For qualified customers, we offer payment terms, generally requiring payment 30 days from shipment. However, we may offer extended payment terms in certain circumstances, including to promote sales of our product. We purchase accounts receivable insurance on certain customers if their risk profile warrants it and the insurance is available. Due to the highly customized nature of our hospitality products, we typically require a 50% deposit with order, a 40% deposit before goods reach a U.S. port and the remaining 10% balance due within 30 days of the receipt of goods by the customer.



Accounts payable: Payment for our imported products warehoused first in Asia is due ten to fourteen days after our quality audit inspections are complete and the vendor invoice is presented. Payment for goods which are shipped to our US warehouses or container direct to our customers FOB Origin (free on board origin, which means the buyer is responsible for the costs and liability of the freight during transport) is generally due upon proof of lading onto a US-bound vessel and invoice presentation; however, payment terms, depending on the supplier, can stretch up to 45 days from invoice date. Payment terms for domestic raw materials and non-inventory related charges vary but are generally 30 days from invoice date.



Order Backlog



At January 30, 2022, our backlog of unshipped orders was as follows:




 | Order Backlog | 
--------------------+-------------------+--------
 | (Dollars in 000s) | 
 | January 30, 2022 | | January 31, 2021
Reporting Segment | Dollars | | Weeks | | Dollars | | Weeks 
Hooker Branded | $ | 68,925 | | 17.9 | | $ | 34,776 | 11.1
Home Meridian | | 167,968 | | 31.3 | | | 180,188 | 33.2
Domestic Upholstery | | 67,068 | | 34.1 | | | 30,271 | 18.8
All Other | | 6,148 | | 27.2 | | | 2,845 | 12.8
Consolidated | $ | 310,109 | | 27.2 | | $ | 248,080 | 23.9

In the discussion below and herein we reference changes in sales orders or “orders” and sales order backlog (unshipped orders at a point in time) or “backlog” over and compared to certain periods of time and changes discussed are in sales dollars and not units of inventory, unless stated otherwise. We believe orders are generally good current indicators of sales momentum and business conditions. If the items ordered are in stock and the customer has requested immediate delivery, we generally ship products in about seven days or less from receipt of order; however, orders may be shipped later if they are out of stock or there are production or shipping delays or the customer has requested the order to be shipped at a later date. It is our policy and industry practice to allow order cancellation for casegoods up to the time of shipment or, in the case of container direct orders, up until the time the container is booked with the ocean freight carrier; therefore, customer orders for casegoods are not firm. However, domestically produced upholstered products are predominantly custom-built and consequently, cannot be cancelled once the leather or fabric has been cut. Additionally, our hospitality products are highly customized and are generally not cancellable.



For the Hooker Branded and Domestic Upholstery segments and All Other, we generally consider backlogs to be one helpful indicator of sales for the upcoming 30-day period, but because of our relatively quick delivery and our cancellation policies, we do not consider order backlogs to be a reliable indicator of expected long-term sales. We generally consider the Home Meridian segment’s backlog to be one helpful indicator of that segment’s sales for the upcoming 90-day period. Due to (i) Home Meridian’s sales volume, (ii) the average sales order sizes of its mass, and mega account channels of distribution, (iii) the proprietary nature of many of its products and (iv) the project nature of its hospitality business, for which average order sizes tend to be larger and consequently, its order backlog tends to be larger. There are exceptions to the general predictive nature of our orders and backlogs noted in this paragraph due to current demand and supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. They are discussed in greater detail below and are essential to understanding our prospects.



We are very encouraged by the current historic levels of orders and backlogs; however, due to the current supply chain issues including the lack and cost of shipping containers and vessel space and limited overseas vendor capacity, orders are not converting to shipments as quickly as would be expected compared to the pre-pandemic environment and we expect that to continue at some level through at least the fiscal 2023 second quarter. The current logistics challenges are slowing order fulfillment, particularly for Home Meridian whose average order sizes tend to be larger and more project-based versus orders for the traditional Hooker businesses, which tend to be smaller and more predictable. Additionally, Home Meridian orders are programmed out and scheduled for delivery to its larger accounts further into the future than usual, which is also contributing to its large backlog.



At the end of fiscal 2022, order backlog increased $62 million or 25% as compared to the prior year end due largely to increased incoming orders in the Hooker Branded and Domestic Upholstery segments, and to a lesser degree, continued supply chain disruptions and delays affecting those segments.



Seasonality



Generally, sales in our fiscal first quarter are lower than our other fiscal quarters due to the post-Chinese New Year shipping lag and sales in our fiscal fourth quarter are generally stronger due to the pre-Chinese New Year surge in shipments from Asia.
Environmental Matters



As a part of our business operations, our manufacturing sites generate both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes; the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local, state and federal laws relating to environmental protection. Our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The costs associated with our environmental responsibilities, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position.
