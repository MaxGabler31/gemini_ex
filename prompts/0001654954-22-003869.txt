Overview 

We are a clinical-stage medical dermatology company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases we believe represent significant market opportunities because current therapies are inadequate or non-existent.

Dermatological diseases such as acne vulgaris (or acne), psoriasis vulgaris (or psoriasis), papulopustular rosacea (or rosacea), hyperhidrosis and various aesthetic indications, affect millions of people worldwide each year, and may negatively impact their quality of life and emotional well-being. While there are multiple current treatment options for these indications on the market, we believe that most have significant drawbacks, including underwhelming efficacy, cumbersome application regimens and varying negative side effects, all of which we believe lead to decreased patient compliance. While a majority of these indications are first treated with topical products, many patients frequently switch treatments or discontinue treatment altogether due to patient dissatisfaction stemming from slow and modest response rates, early onset of negative side effects, onerous application schedules and typically long duration of therapy. For diseases like psoriasis, a small percentage of patients may be candidates for biologic or systemic therapies, but these patients are typically required to try topical or oral treatment options prior to qualifying for these expensive biologic or systemic therapies. Given the limitations with current topical therapies and the restricted usability of biologic and systemic therapies, we believe there is a significant opportunity to address the needs of frustrated patients searching for topical products that satisfy their dermatological and lifestyle needs. 

Our two product candidates, DMT310 and DMT410, both incorporate our proprietary, multifaceted, Spongilla technology to topically treat a variety of dermatological conditions. Our Spongilla technology is a multifactorial, naturally-derived product that is processed from a naturally grown freshwater sponge, Spongilla lacustris or Spongilla, which is processed into a powder that is mixed with a fluidizing agent immediately prior to application by the patient to form an easily applicable paste. Spongilla is a unique freshwater sponge that only grows in commercial quantities in select regions of the world and under specific environmental conditions, all of which give it its distinctive anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and mechanical properties. The combination of these environmental conditions, the proprietary harvesting protocols developed with our supplier, and our post-harvest processing procedures produce a pharmaceutical product candidate that optimizes the mechanical component as well as the chemical components of the sponge for a product candidate with multiple mechanisms of action for the treatment of inflammatory skin conditions.

Our lead product candidate DMT310, is intended to utilize our Spongilla technology for a once weekly treatment of a variety of skin diseases with our initial focus being for the treatment of acne vulgaris. However, due to the multiple mechanisms of action and anti-inflammatory effect seen with DMT310 throughout our various clinical trials for acne, we have quickly moved DMT310 into clinical trials for two additional indications, psoriasis and rosacea. We recently completed a Phase 1b proof of concept, or POC, trial in psoriasis and in November 2021 we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of rosacea. 

Our second product candidate utilizing our Spongilla technology is our combination treatment, DMT410. DMT410 is intended to consist of one treatment of our proprietary sponge powder followed by one topical application of botulinum toxin for delivery into the dermis. We first tested this program in a Phase 1 POC trial of axillary hyperhidrosis patients which saw 80% of patients achieve a reduction in gravimetric sweat production greater than 50% four weeks after treatment. Based on DMT410’s ability to effectively deliver botulinum toxin to the dermis, we initiated a Phase 1 POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions. On November 19, 2021, we announced top-line results from this trial where we saw encouraging data that we believe warrants further investigation of this program.

We believe our Spongilla technology platform will enable us to develop and formulate singular and combination products that are able to target topical delivery of chemical compounds into the dermis for a variety of indications. We believe the mechanical ability of the Spongilla technology allows for the intradermal delivery of a variety of large and small molecules to a targeted treatment site, through topical application as seen in our Phase 1a DMT410 hyperhidrosis trial. We believe the combination of Spongilla’s mechanical and chemical components (which we believe have demonstrated, in-vitro, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties), add to the versatility of our Spongilla technology platform, allowing for application in the treatment of a wide variety of medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases. 

DMT310 is intended to consist of two grams of powder processed from a naturally grown freshwater sponge, Spongilla lacustris, which powder is then mixed with a fluidizing agent (hydrogen peroxide) immediately prior to application by the patient to form an easily applicable paste, like a mud mask. The paste is left on the skin for approximately fifteen minutes until dry, after which time it is washed off with water. Due to the unique combination of DMT310’s mechanical components and chemical components, we believe patients will only need to apply the product once weekly to produce a treatment effect. The mechanical components of the Spongilla powder consist of many microscopic siliceous spicules that, when massaged into the skin, penetrate the stratum corneum (the skin’s outermost protective layer) and create microchannels into the dermis where many facets of inflammatory skin diseases reside. We believe that the penetration of the spicules cause opening of microchannels which allow oxygen to enter pilosebaceoius glands, helping to kill C. acnes, which grow in an anaerobic environment (C. acnes is the bacteria that cause inflammatory lesions in acne patients).  The spicules also cause turnover of the top layer of dead skin, increasing collagen production. The spicules may also provide a channel for DMT310’s naturally occurring chemical compounds to be delivered to the dermis and pilosebaceous glands, helping to kill the C. acnes. In addition to these anti-microbial compounds, DMT310 also appears to have anti-inflammatory chemical compounds, as demonstrated in in-vitro experiments, that inhibit inflammation through the reduction of C.acnes stimulated IL-8 production and by inhibiting IL-17A and IL-17F expression in human cell lines. Also during in-vitro studies of DMT310’s organic compounds, we observed the inhibition of lipogenesis of sebocytes, which may translate to a reduction in sebum (an oily and waxy substance produced by the human body’s sebaceous glands) production and oiliness of the skin in patients, which has been noted by a number of clinical investigators in our previous acne studies. We believe the combination of these biological effects along with the mechanical effects of the spicules are important factors to treat multiple inflammatory skin diseases.

Application of DMT310 


Image 1: The Spongilla is processed into a fine powder and packaged into 2g pouches with a 6mL bottle of 3% H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide). Once per week, patients mix the powder with hydrogen peroxide, and massage the mixture onto their skin; after 10-15 minutes the product is easily removed with water.

DMT410 is the second product candidate from our Spongilla platform. We are developing DMT410 for the topical treatment of skin diseases and conditions typically treated with multiple intradermal injections of botulinum toxin. DMT410’s combination treatment regimen uses one application of our unique Spongilla powder followed by one topical application of botulinum toxin to enable the topical delivery of botulinum toxin into the dermis for the treatment of a variety of indications, including for the treatment of hyperhidrosis and multiple aesthetic skin conditions, including improvement in overall skin quality, reducing pore size and count, reducing sebum production, reducing fine lines and increasing brightness and luminosity. If approved by the FDA, we believe DMT410’s topical delivery of botulinum toxin can greatly increase its market opportunities due DMT410’s needle-free application, targeted intradermal delivery and potential for expanded indications.

We believe that the current medical and aesthetic dermatology landscape lacks innovative treatment options, mainly seeing the introduction of reformulations and combinations of old molecules. This provides an ideal opportunity to change how patients treat their skin conditions. With our anticipated once weekly treatment schedule, we believe we can become a leader in the space with a product candidate derived from a natural sponge that may improve patient compliance with minimal side effects and a rapid time to treatment effect, as seen in our multiple clinical trials in acne and psoriasis. If we can successfully develop our product candidates, receive FDA approval, develop a concentrated prescribing base of dermatologists, and utilize our management’s prior experience, we believe we have the ability to build a commercial organization to develop and commercialize treatment options in our core areas of focus within the dermatology space. 

Our Clinical Development Pipeline and Product Candidates 

Our clinical development pipeline currently consists of DMT310 and DMT410, each in development for multiple skin diseases and conditions. In the accompanying section we will describe each product candidate, its benefits, and our market strategy for each product candidate. The dates reflected in the below table and sections are estimates only, and there can be no assurances that the events included in the below table or sections will be completed on the anticipated timeline presented, or at all. 



DMT310 

Moderate-to-Severe Acne. In June 2020, we completed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of DMT310 for the once weekly treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. DMT310 showed statistically significant improvement versus placebo for all three endpoints (inflammatory lesion counts, non-inflammatory lesion counts, and the Investigators Global Assessment), after only four topical treatments and continued until the end of study at week 12. We plan on using these same endpoints in our two upcoming Phase 3 trials to support the filing of our NDA for DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris. We believe these results from once weekly applications may favorably position DMT310 in the market for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. We intend to initiate the two required Phase 3 clinical trials in 2023 after holding our End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2023. 

Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis. In October 2021, we completed a Phase 1b POC trial of DMT310 for the once weekly treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that comprises approximately 80% of the psoriasis market as of 2019, according to Fortune Business Insights Market Research Report, with a majority of patients having mild-to-moderate disease which makes them less likely to receive an approved biologic treatment, that are only indicated for patients with moderate to severe disease, as a first line therapy. Due to the large population of patients who suffer from mild-to-moderate psoriasis, and lack of effective topical therapies for more mild disease, we believe there is a large unmet need for an effective topical product with limited side effects. Based on the data in our Phase 1b POC trial, the in-vitro data of DMT310’s reduction of IL-17A and IL-17F, and the anti-inflammatory effects we observed in its Phase 2b trial for acne, we believe DMT310 may be used as a first-line therapy for patients suffering from mild-to-moderate psoriasis who are not candidates for biologic treatments.

In October 2021, we announced top-line results from our Phase 1b POC trial of DMT310 for the treatment of 30 mild-to-moderate patients with psoriatic lesions covering between 2% to 30% of their body surface area. Patients were treated with DMT310 once a week for 12 weeks. Based on the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile observed in the POC trial, we initiated additional work to better inform our clinical trial design prior to moving into a larger Phase 2, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, which we anticipate initiating in 2022. Assuming this trial is successful, we plan on requesting an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2023, followed by Phase 3 psoriasis studies in the first half of 2024.

Moderate-to-Severe Rosacea. We enrolled our first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of DMT310 for the once weekly treatment of moderate-to-severe rosacea in November 2021. Papulopustular Rosacea, or subtype II, is a chronic skin disease characterized by inflammatory lesions on the face that typically affects adults of all ages, but particularly affects women aged 30-50 and can cause great emotional and psychological distress. Due to the lack of effective therapies currently on the market, we believe there is a significant need for an effective topical product with limited side effects. Based on the effect against inflammatory lesions observed in the Phase 2b acne trial, along with multiple biomarkers seen in-vitro, we believe DMT310 may have similar anti-inflammatory effects in rosacea as seen in acne due to it also being a disease of inflammatory lesions on the face and may be a potential treatment option for patients suffering from this disease. We plan to enroll 180 patients, 18 years of age or older, with moderate-to-severe rosacea and provide them with once weekly treatments of DMT310 for 12 weeks and plan to report top-line results from this trial in the second half of 2022. The clinical endpoints for this trial are intended to be the absolute reduction in inflammatory lesion count, and an Investigator’s Global Assessment score on a scale of 0 to 4. 

There can be no assurance that DMT310 will receive FDA approval for any of the foregoing indications. 

DMT410 

We are developing the second product candidate from our Spongilla platform, DMT410, for the topical treatment of skin diseases and aesthetic conditions typically treated with multiple injections of botulinum toxin. Currently, botulinum toxin must be injected multiple times to successfully deliver enough botulinum toxin to the desired treatment area. While injections are effective for many different diseases and aesthetic conditions, they limit botulinum toxin’s use for additional conditions where injections are difficult, painful, or otherwise not viable. DMT410’s combination treatment regimen uses one application of our unique Spongilla powder followed by one topical application of botulinum toxin. The Spongilla powder is mixed with a fluidizing agent and is massaged into a patient’s treatment area by the treating physician to enhance spicule penetration to create microchannels into the dermis. After 10 to 15 minutes, the physician removes the Spongilla mask with water. The physician then expresses botulinum toxin from a syringe in precise amounts and onto the patient’s skin. The botulinum toxin is then massaged into the treatment area to take advantage of the microchannels created by Spongilla’s spicules, which allows the botulinum toxin to penetrate the stratum corneum and enter the dermis. We believe this treatment application will enable the topical delivery of botulinum toxin into the dermis for the treatment of a variety of medical diseases, including for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, acne, and rosacea, as well as improving skin, luminosity, brightness, and reducing pore size and count, and fine lines. We believe DMT410’s topical delivery of botulinum toxin can greatly increase market opportunities for botulinum toxin due DMT410’s needle-free application, targeted intradermal delivery and potential for expanded indications that do not require injections.

To date, we have completed an open-label Phase 1b POC clinical trials of DMT410 for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis and an open-label Phase 1b POC clinical trial in multiple aesthetic skin conditions. The Phase 1b POC trial for axillary hyperhidrosis consisted of 10 patients receiving one treatment of DMT410 on each axilla. Four weeks after one treatment with DMT410, patients exhibited reduction in sweat production. The clinical endpoints for this trial included (i) percent of patients with greater than 50% reduction in gravimetrically measured sweat production from baseline, (ii) percent of patients with gravimetric sweat production less than 50mg, and (iii) percent change in gravimetric sweat production. Four weeks after one treatment with DMT410, 80% of patients experienced a decrease in gravimetric sweat production greater than 50%, 85% of patients experienced gravimetric sweat production of less than 50mg, and patients had an average decrease in gravimetric sweat production of 75% from baseline. We believe these results support that DMT410 may aid in the topical delivery of botulinum toxin into the dermis for a treatment effect similar to multiple injections of botulinum toxin. With DMT410, we believe botulinum toxin may be applied topically to penetrate the skin into the dermis without the need for multiple injections.

We recently completed an open-label, ten (10) patient, Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions ( pore size, Global Aesthetic Improvement, brightness, luminosity, sebum production, fine lines under the eye, glabellar lines, forehead lines, and lateral canthal lines. In our Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410, patients received one treatment of DMT410 and were evaluated every four weeks for a total duration of 16 weeks to determine DMT410’s safety and tolerability profile, effectiveness, and its duration of treatment effect. We announced top-line results in November 2021, where we observed an improvement in many of the trial’s endpoints. At week 8, 80% of patients had at least a 25% improvement in their Global Aesthetic and 60% of patients had a 25% improvement in pore size. Also at week 8, 90% of patients had at least a one-point improvement in luminosity and 60% of patients had at least a one-point improvement in brightness. These physicians graded results were supported by objective analysis provided by Canfield Scientific’s VISIA and PRIMOS visual analysis camera systems. Based on these results, we are actively seeking a partner with a botulinum toxin to continue development of DMT410 in a larger placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial where we can study multiple doses of botulinum toxin applied to the entire face. We believe these results, combined with our results in hyperhidrosis, further demonstrate how DMT410’s combination regimen could greatly expand the potential indications for botulinum toxins for aesthetic skin conditions, as well as other dermatologic skin diseases such as hyperhidrosis, acne, or rosacea.

There can be no assurance that DMT410 will receive FDA approval for any of the foregoing indications. 

Our Strategy 

We plan on in-licensing, developing and commercializing differentiated medical and aesthetic dermatology product candidates for the treatment of various skin diseases and conditions, which we believe have significant unmet needs in the market. The key components of this strategy are as follows: 

· | Complete development and regulatory approval of DMT310 for acne. We recently completed a Phase 2b clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. We plan to hold an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2023 and initiate two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for DMT310 approximately 3-4 months after receiving feedback from the FDA at the EOP2 meeting. The Phase 3 trials will take approximately 15 months to complete. Assuming positive results from these two Phase 3 trials, we plan on submitting an New Drug Application approximately 6 months after completion of the trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Complete a Phase 2 trial of DMT310 for the treatment of psoriasis. In October 2021, we announced top-line results of our Phase 1b POC trial in patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. We believe the results of this POC study warrant the continued development of DMT310 for the treatment of psoriasis. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial for DMT310 in psoriasis in 2022. If successfully developed and commercialized, we believe DMT310 would be the first once weekly topical product available to treat psoriasis. 
· | Complete a Phase 2 trial of DMT310 in rosacea. Based on the data obtained from our Phase 2 trials in acne and the anti-inflammatory results seen in-vitro, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of DMT310 for the treatment of rosacea in November 2021, with top-line results expected in 2022. We believe this will help bolster our pipeline and could establish the broader use of DMT310 in multiple inflammatory skin diseases. 


8


· | Explore mutually beneficial partnership opportunities for our DMT410 program in hyperhidrosis and aesthetic skin conditions. In November 2021, we announced top-line results of our Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions using our Spongilla technology for the topical application of OnabotulinumtoxinA (brand name BOTOX®). We believe this trial provides further evidance of the ability for DMT410 to topically deliver botulinum toxin into the dermis for skin conditions and diseases. Based on the results of DMT410 in hyperhidrosis and aesthetics, we are currently exploring partnership opportunities to further develop DMT410 for the topical treatment of skin diseases and aesthetic skin conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Acquire or in-license additional dermatology programs to our portfolio that complement our current product candidates. We continuously evaluate potential partnering opportunities that will bolster our current product candidate portfolio and provide substantial value to our organization. We intend to focus on early to mid-stage development product candidates to generate clinical data and potentially move to later stages of development and ultimately on to commercialization. 
· | Maximize the value of our portfolio by commercializing our product candidates in territories where we can do so effectively and partner for other territories to help us reach new markets. If we receive FDA approval for our product candidates, we plan to maximize the territories where our product candidates could be sold by partnering with established companies in new territories outside of the U.S. market, if possible. 
· | Further strengthen our intellectual property portfolio, path to new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity, raw material supply and advance our regulatory filings. We plan to continue to strengthen our IP portfolio, seek NCE exclusivity for DMT310, maintain our exclusive supply agreement for our raw material requirements, and continue to protect our proprietary information. We believe these activities will be our primary competitive advantages if our product candidates receive regulatory approval. 


The dates reflected in the foregoing are estimates only, and there can be no assurances that the events included will be completed on the anticipated timeline presented, or at all. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the development of DMT310 or DMT410, or any other product candidate we may develop in the future, or that DMT310 or DMT410, or any other product candidate we may develop in the future, will receive FDA approval for any indication. 

Dermatology Market Overview 

We are currently focused on the medical and aesthetics dermatology markets, which include multiple common and undertreated skin diseases and conditions such as acne, rosacea, psoriasis, hyperhidrosis, and multiple aesthetic conditions, some with no currently approved products, including the reduction of fine lines, pore size, sebum production and improvement in luminosity and overall skin quality. We believe these diseases and conditions cause significant negative impacts on patients’ quality of life, including physical and emotional trauma and social stigmatism, causing patients to constantly seek better treatment options to help alleviate their conditions. We also believe these markets have not experienced the same level of development and advances as other markets, as there have been few novel or innovative topical products recently approved other than reformulations or combinations of existing compounds. We believe our product candidates will be well situated within the market and offer the innovative solutions to the underserved medical and aesthetic dermatology markets. 

The U.S. medical dermatology market has experienced significant growth in recent years based on the new treatment options and greater patient access to care. Based on current market data, the U.S. medical dermatology market (excluding biologics) was valued at over $16 billion dollars in prescription pharmaceutical sales in 2020. 

The American Society of Plastic Surgeons estimates that over 15.4 million cosmetic procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2016, of which about 7 million used botulinum toxin. There are many factors that continue to drive growth in the aesthetics dermatology market such as greater patient acceptance, including from an increase in younger patients, and the discretionary cash that patients are willing to spend on aesthetic care. We also believe patients have a growing willingness to pay out-of-pocket for effective skin treatments in achieve their desired personal aesthetic look, which further supports the demand and pricing in those markets. 


9


Based on the foregoing, we believe the dermatology market, both aesthetics and medical, offers a low-cost commercialization opportunity compared to many other prescription based specialty markets, due to the relatively small number of specialists in the dermatology field. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, in 2020 there were approximately 18,000 dermatologists in the U.S. We plan to target a subset of these dermatologists, who are larger prescribers of competitive products and who treat a large percentage of patients with our approved indications by creating a targeted sales force, to cover a significant portion of our target physicians. We believe the combination of a prescription based and cash-pay based product lines is an attractive business opportunity, as it incorporates multiple aspects of the dermatology market that move independent of the greater healthcare market. 

Background of Our Spongilla Technology 

Spongilla Lacustris Overview 

Spongilla lacustris, or Spongilla, is a freshwater sponge from the Spongillidea family that grows in freshwater rivers and lakes in commercial quantities in select regions of the world. It becomes dormant during the winter months and regrows each year to growth forms ranging from encrusting, to digitate, to branched, depending on its habitat’s growth conditions. While it grows in many parts of the northern hemisphere, there are only certain locations where it grows in the quantities and of the quality to viably support a commercial pharmaceutical product. One such location is the Volga River in central Russia, where we have signed an exclusive supply agreement with one of the larger known suppliers of Spongilla raw material for DMT310, which guarantees our supply of Spongilla raw material. Traditionally, locals would harvest small amounts of Spongilla for its perceived medicinal properties and use it as a folk medicine to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. Over the last 18 years, our exclusive supplier has refined its harvesting methods and procedures and is now capable of supplying a high quality raw material. Our supplier has the capacity to collect and process large quantities of Spongilla per year. We believe our supplier will be able to supply a raw material in the quantities and of the quality necessary to support our clinical and commercial needs. 

The traditional use of Spongilla in Russia has provided a large amount of safety data. In 2003, the Russian Ministry of Health indicated that Spongilla has been used by over one million people per year, with few reported safety issues. In 2017, we submitted this safety information, along with various other publications and non-clinical studies, in an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the FDA’s Division of Dermatology and Dental Products with reference to the FDA’s Botanical Drug Development Guidance for Industry, or Botanical Guidance. This submission enabled the FDA to approve our IND for DMT310, allowing us to proceed directly into a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients due in part to historical human exposure. While we are still required to complete a majority of required non-clinical and pharmacokinetic studies, we were able to strategically conserve resources while gathering human clinical efficacy and safety data prior to beginning such work. 

Spongilla’s Multiple Mechanism of Actions 

The unique properties of Spongilla lacustris not only allows us to reference the FDA’s Botanical Guidance, but also helps ensure the regrowth of sufficient supply of raw material each year. While Spongilla is technically a part of the animal kingdom, it grows and acts more similarly to a plant in that it can completely regenerate every year, even in harsh environmental conditions. In addition to causing a regrowth of the sponge each year, the harsh environmental conditions the sponge lives in helps contribute to our Spongilla technologies’ multiple mechanisms of actions. Based on knowledge gained from over almost 18 years of harvesting Spongilla, our supplier has learned the necessary environmental conditions and Spongilla characteristics that must be present for optimal raw material harvest and to ensure the raw material contains the necessary properties for an effective pharmaceutical product. These properties include both mechanical and chemical components that are a naturally occurring part of the sponge raw material and contribute to our Spongilla technology’s mechanisms of action in the treatment of skin diseases and conditions. 


10


The mechanical components of DMT310 come from the Spongilla’s skeletal structure, which is made up of siliceous spicules that are bound together by organic material, as seen in Image 2 below. These spicules are smooth, rod-like shapes which come to a point on each end, and if the Spongilla is harvested under certain proprietary environmental conditions, the spicules can average between 150-300 micrometers in length and about 10-15 micrometers in diameter. While there are other types of freshwater and marine sponges, many of their spicules can be covered in barbs or hooks which we believe would get stuck in the skin or are blunt on each end, making skin penetration difficult. 


Image 2: Siliceous Spicules Present in Spongilla

After harvesting and further processing in the U.S., the shape and size of our spicules make them the ideal mechanism to penetrate the stratum corneum, the skins barrier, and temporarily create a micro-channel into the dermis without penetrating into subcutaneous tissue, where the larger blood vessels are located. These newly created microchannels temporarily open the skin’s barrier to allow for the targeted delivery of large and small chemical compounds into the dermis. Most topically applied products currently contain various penetration enhancers that help force the active molecule through the stratum corneum and into the dermis, such as Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO). However, these penetration enhancers are only able to help smaller molecules penetrate and are usually unable to aid larger molecules, such as botulinum toxin, in topical delivery. These penetration enhancers can also cause unwanted side effects such as dry skin or garlic like taste, breath, and body odor. We believe our Spongilla technology is differentiated by enabling the delivery of both small and large molecules through topical application with less irritation and side effects than other topically applied products. 

In addition to creating many microchannels in the skin, we believe the penetration of the spicules can open closed comedones, allowing oxygen into the anaerobic environment of the clogged pilosebaceous glands, where C.acnes and other bacteria survive. Lastly, we believe the spicules promote collagen production within the skin which accelerates the skin’s rejuvenation period, thus bringing refreshed skin to the surface at a quicker rate than the skins normal turnover cycle. Typically, the skin takes between three to four weeks to bring a new layer to the surface, while we believe our Spongilla technology may allow this process to complete in less than one week. We believe this decreases the time to treat inflammatory skin diseases and conditions while also enhancing the look of a patient’s skin. 

Our Spongilla technology also contains multiple active chemical compounds that we believe may aid in our product candidates’ treatment of multiple dermatology skin diseases and conditions. We believe part of Spongilla’s natural defense mechanism is the creation of organic material to fight off natural enemies present in the water in which it grows. This organic material binds its spicules together to form the skeletal structure of the sponge. Based on multiple in-vitro studies, we believe the organic compounds within the sponge, when separated from the spicules, have both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. We have observed anti-inflammatory activity including reduction of C. acnes, stimulated IL-8 production, and the downregulation of the production of IL-17A and IL-17F in human cell lines. Additionally, in our in-vitro studies, we observed the inhibition of lipogenesis of sebocytes, which may translate to a reduction in sebum production and oiliness of the skin in patients. 

While we believe each of the mechanical or chemical components of our Spongilla technology may be beneficial in treating various diseases, we believe the impact of each mechanism may be greatly enhanced when combined with the other. The large number spicules contained in each treatment create many microchannels through the stratum corneum, allowing for sufficient penetration and delivery of the chemical components into the treatment area to fight inflammation and bacteria.

FDA Botanical Drug Development Guidance for Industry 

Most currently approved topical dermatology products are reviewed solely by the FDA’s Office of Dermatology and Dental Products and follow a standard approval pathway. However, due to our lead product candidate, DMT310, being derived from a natural source, it will be reviewed by the FDA Office of Dermatology and Dental Products with input from the FDA Botanical Review Division. While Spongilla is not a botanical, the FDA has allowed us to reference the Botanical Guidance for raw material quality control and batch to batch consistency through development and into commercialization. We believe our ability to reference the Botanical Guidance and receive input from the Botanical Review Division on DMT310 provides us with key advantages in DMT310’s regulatory pathway to approval, if achieved. These advantages include being able to move into human clinical studies upon the FDA’s acknowledged receipt of our IND letter and subsequent study may proceed, saving us substantial financial resources to achieve human clinical data. Additionally, while we believe that our sponge contains multiple active chemical compounds, based on our regulatory analysis of the feedback from the FDA and the Botanical Guidance, we believe we are only required to provide identifiable and quantifiable active components to show quality control and batch to batch consistency. We believe this will make it more difficult for potential competitors to replicate DMT310 due to their inability to know every component of our product candidate and to show their product is similar in its composition. Thus, we believe a competitor with a similar product or product candidate would have to follow all the manufacturing, development, and regulatory steps we must complete for approval. However, there can be no assurance that we successfully navigate the development of DMT310 or that DMT310 will receive FDA approval. 
Our Product Candidates 

DMT310 

Our lead product candidate, DMT310, is a unique, once weekly, naturally derived topical product, first being developed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, or acne. It is derived from freshwater Spongilla lacustris, or Spongilla, which grows under certain environmental conditions in select locations throughout the northern hemisphere. Our Spongilla raw material is harvested by our exclusive partner in Russia abiding by strict protocols which our supplier has developed over 18 years. The result of these strict protocols is a consistent chemical structure that is reproducible year after year, which is critical in producing a material able to be used in a pharmaceutical product. After harvesting, the Spongilla is shipped to our manufacturing facility in the U.S. for further processing into a uniform powder before being packaged into sachets. Immediately prior to treatment the patient will mix the powder with a diluent (hydrogen peroxide) to form a paste which the patient can then apply to the treatment area to treat the multiple facets of their disease. DMT310 utilizes the Spongilla’s mechanical spicules to help resurface a patient’s skin while also creating microchannels through the stratum corneum to allow the penetration of the Spongilla’s naturally created organic compounds to help treat various skin diseases. We believe these organic compounds can travel through the newly created microchannels into the dermis and sebaceous gland where both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions originate. DMT310 targets treatment of the multiple facets of acne by combining the substantial mechanical and chemical activity of Spongilla into an easy to apply product that only needs to be applied once weekly. If approved by the FDA, we believe the combination of the mechanical and chemical properties of DMT310 has the potential for a more rapid time to treatment effect with fewer treatments, less side effects and better tolerability than other currently marketed topical acne products. 

DMT310 for Treatment of Acne Vulgaris 

Market Opportunity. Acne is characterized by areas of scaly red skin, non-inflammatory blackheads and whiteheads, inflammatory lesions, papules, and pustules and occasionally cysts and scarring that occur on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and upper arms. It affects approximately 50 million people in the U.S., with about 85% of teenagers experiencing some form of acne. The U.S. prescription acne market had approximately $2.3 billion in prescription pharmaceutical sales in 2019, according to IQVIA Inc. market data.

Most patients experience some form of acne during their teenage years and for some, their acne may diminish over time, or at least tends to decrease by age 25. There is, however, no way to predict how long it will take for acne to disappear entirely, with some individuals suffering from acne well into their 30s, 40s and beyond. While not life-threatening, acne causes significant trauma for those suffering from it due to social stigmas, substantial risk of permanent facial scarring, lowered self-esteem and social withdrawal. Therefore, we believe early and aggressive treatment with an effective once weekly product may lessen the overall long-term impact of this disease and may lead to an increase in a patient’s quality of life. 

Due to acne’s negative impact on a patient’s quality of life and negative impact on facial aesthetic, patients suffering from acne tend to be highly motivated to treat their acne and we believe more willing to pay more out-of-pocket for higher priced and highly effective treatments. It is our belief that patients seeking an easy to use and effective topical product will tolerate less favorable reimbursement rates than for other prescription products for other indications, allowing for favorable pricing if we are able to eventually obtain approval for and successfully commercialize DMT310 for acne. Furthermore, if approved, we believe that DMT310’s natural characteristics may allow us to expand our addressable acne market to include those patients who value using naturally derived products, such as DMT310. 

The acne market can be broken into three separate classes based on the severity of the acne: 

• | Mild Acne: characterized by few papules or pustules; typically treated with over-the-counter products or topical prescription therapies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Moderate Acne: characterized by multiple papules and pustules with moderate inflammation; typically treated with a combination of oral and topical prescription therapies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Severe Acne: characterized by substantial papules and pustules, with many nodules and/or cysts and significant inflammation; currently treated with oral and topical combination treatments and photodynamic therapy as a third-line treatment option.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of Current Standard of Care. While current treatment options may be effective for some patients, there are many limitations and drawbacks of current acne products which cause poor patient adherence. All currently approved topical therapies for the treatment of acne must be applied once or twice a day to allow an accumulation of product within the skin to effectively treat the disease. This requirement to apply multiple times per day becomes very onerous and time consuming for patients, causing many patients to fail to comply with the strict application regimen and/or skip multiple treatments. Proper use and application schedules are particularly important for topical acne products and poor patient adherence may lead to reduced treatment effect and ultimately discontinuation of treatment due to lack of effect.

Many current acne products, such as retinoids, must be applied at least once-a-day and may cause significant stinging, burning, and peeling after each application. These tolerability issues, which may start occurring after the first application, and the substantial discomfort they cause, lead many patients to discontinue the necessary daily application schedule. It is well known that benzoyl peroxide, or BPO, leads to drying of the skin and that retinoids result in many local skin reactions including erythema, burning, and peeling, after the first treatment. It has been observed in the combination study of adapalene/BPO, where more than 20% of the subjects reported moderate or severe erythema and stinging/burning. 

Lastly, most topical products have an unavoidable latency period of 6-8 weeks until patients have a definite improvement. This means they may have to endure 30 to 60 applications before observing that their acne is improving (assuming a daily, or twice daily regimen), all while dealing with the burning, stinging, and peeling that may accompany these topical products. We believe that teenagers, who make up the largest segment of the acne market, become impatient with the lack of rapid perceived effect leading to premature discontinuation of treatment. The lack of rapid treatment effect, side effects, and onerous application schedules all greatly contribute to patient compliance issues and could ultimately lead to treatment failure. We believe patients are more concerned with efficacy outcomes than costs, thus we believe patients will be more willing to pay higher out of pocket costs.

Our Solution for Moderate-to-Severe Acne. If approved, we believe DMT310’s once weekly application regimen will increase patient compliance, potentially increasing the likelihood of improved acne results. Using our multifaceted, once weekly Spongilla treatment technology, we are developing DMT310 to create a paradigm shift in how acne is treated by dermatologists by attempting to make DMT310 the preferred treatment option for all acne patients. We have designed DMT310 to treat the multiple factors of acne while also attempting to increase patient compliance. 

If approved, we believe DMT310 has the potential to remedy many of the negative characteristics associated with current topical therapies for moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris, including cumbersome treatment regimens, negative side effects (including burning, stinging, itching or dryness, which may occur as early as the first treatment and continue daily thereafter), and delayed time to effectiveness (which may take up to eight weeks). DMT310 is designed to be applied only once a week, rather than once or twice a day. We believe a once weekly schedule may be conducive to high patient compliance. In addition, in our recent Phase 2b acne trial, on average, patients experienced an approximately 45% reduction in inflammatory acne lesions after just four treatments, with continued improvement of up to 62% reduction at 12 weeks. Further, approximately 90% of patients had no, or mild, tolerability issues at the end of the 12-week trial and no patients experienced any severe tolerability issues. 

In addition, in our Phase 2b trial we observed that DMT310 started showing a statistically significant difference from placebo after just four treatments while also having a rapid reduction on inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. We believe this rapid visible response encouraged patients to continue to adhere to the once weekly application schedule leading to a continued reduction in their lesions until the end of trial at week 12. Thus, we believe that a topical product that needs to be applied only once weekly with a quicker time to perceived treatment effect and fewer tolerability issues has the opportunity to exhibit greater treatment success due to improved patient adherence leading to loyal and repeat users. 

DMT310 for the Treatment of Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis 

We believe that DMT310 could also be an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis based on the data received from our recently completed Phase 1b POC trial and the in-vitro effect seen on the down regulation of IL-17A and IL-17F, as well as its ease of application to mild-to-moderate psoriatic lesions with smaller surface areas. 

Psoriasis is characterized by “plaques,” or raised red areas of skin covered with a silver or white layer of dead skin cells referred to as “scales.” Psoriatic plaques can appear on any area of the body, but most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, trunk, and limbs, and the plaques are often itchy and sometimes painful. The psoriasis lesions are characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and a lymphocyte-rich infiltrate consisting primarily of T cells. In the dermis and epidermis, T lymphocytes interact with antigen-presenting cells and secrete Th1 and Th17 cytokines. These activated T cells and the inflammatory cytokines they secrete are believed to induce the skin lesions seen in psoriasis. In addition to the broad anti-inflammatory properties, we have observed in our clinical acne studies, DMT310’s ability exhibited in-vitro a dose dependent inhibition of both IL-17A and IL-17F, key cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Thus, DMT310 may provide a method to topically deliver targeted anti-inflammatory therapy directly to psoriatic lesions with good local tolerability in an easy to apply regimen. 

Market Opportunity. Patients are either underdiagnosed, undertreated or left untreated. This leaves patients seeking new treatment options. Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder estimated to affect up to 3.2% of the world’s population with global sales of $14.2 billion in 2020, which is projected to increase to $27.5 billion by 2030. Plaque-type psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, occurring in more than 80-90% of cases of psoriasis with approximately 80% of patients experiencing the mild disease form and 20% experiencing moderate-to-severe form of the disease. In addition to the disfigurement caused by psoriatic lesions, patients also may experience pruritus, or itching, which can be particularly common and bothersome for patients. Not only does psoriasis cause direct clinical challenges, but patients also suffer a negative impact on their quality of life. Patients can suffer substantial psychological impacts from their disease, including, social stigmas, feelings of rejections and shame, discrimination in the workplace, and reduced productivity, among many others. These patients are commonly looking for a safe and effective product to treat their disease.

Limitations of Current Standard of Care. Most of the available therapies target moderate-to-severe disease, meaning that mild patients are undertreated with one in five not being happy with their current treatments. The treatments for mild psoriasis patients are mostly generic, but are often inadequate to control a patient’s disease. Mild psoriasis patients are first treated with topical therapies due to the reduced systemic exposure. However, patients often feel that topical treatments are one of the negative aspects of psoriasis, which we believe is partly due to the limited options available like, coal tar, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids. While topical steroids are a very common treatment, drawbacks include being able to be used only for a short period of time and are associated with Hypothalamic pituitary adrena axis suppression, skin atrophy (thinning), striae (stretch marks), and telangiectasia (spider veins), among other side effects. Furthermore, some of these side effects are irreversible, persisting even after therapy is discontinued. Consequently, high-potency topical steroids are not recommended for chronic use and physicians generally will not prescribe them for treatment on the face. Also, rebound is a known challenge with steroids, where after steroid discontinuation, the psoriasis returns even worse than it was before steroid treatment was initiated.

While biologic therapies, including drugs such as Enbrel, Cosentyx, Humira, and Stelara, are available for treatment of psoriasis, their use remains highly restricted to patients with moderate-to-severe disease. In the U.S., with less than 20% of patients having moderate-to-severe psoriasis, we believe a vast majority of the psoriasis market are left without long-term effective treatment options. While additional data has caused an uptake of biologics, they remain limited due to multiple factors, including being indicated only for use in moderate-to-severe patients, high costs, consequent reimbursement and access restrictions, frequent high patient co-pays, perceived risk of side effects, and patient fear of injection. Additionally, we believe there is room for topical products that treat mild psoriasis to be priced at a premium compared to other topical products for other inflammatory skin diseases like acne. This is based on fact that when comparing the cost of biologic therapy, which can cost $50,000 per year, an effective and safe topical product for mild psoriasis could have a large impact on the market. Therefore, we believe physicians would be more likely to prescribe a topical product for psoriasis long before biologic treatment, and patients experiencing milder psoriasis would prefer using a topical product over a systemic treatment.

Non-biologic systemic therapy options for psoriasis exist, but their use is also limited due to unfavorable side effects. Apremilast (Otezla), an oral PDE4 inhibitor, generated more than $1 billion in sales in all indications in 2019, but has only achieved a small patient share in psoriasis due to limitations on its use to moderate-to-severe patients, its modest symptomatic improvement, and frequent adverse events. We believe there is still a great need to bring to market a product that addresses mild-to-moderate psoriasis. 

Due to the shortcomings of existing topical therapies and the lack of options providing robust symptomatic improvement with chronic treatment, especially in the last 25 years, we believe there remains a need for a safe, effective, and easily applicable topical treatment for chronic disease, that has a low risk of side effects, is well tolerated, and can be easily applied on all anatomical areas. 

Our solution for Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis. Similar to the needs of patients with acne, we believe patients suffering with psoriasis might comply better with a treatment that is easy to apply and requires less application time than current treatment options. DMT310, if approved, could be used as a first line therapy for patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. We believe the spicules within DMT310 will help break up the psoriatic lesions, while the anti-inflammatory components of DMT310 assist with the healing of the lesions. Due to the historical use of Spongilla and the human safety data collected to date in our clinical studies, we believe DMT310 may be suitable for long term treatment of chronic psoriasis due to its unique treatment effect and acceptable safety and tolerability profile. 

In addition to the mechanical effects of DMT310, extracts of the organic material have shown in-vitro to have a dose dependent inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F secretion. In the dermis and epidermis, T lymphocytes interact with antigen-presenting cells and secrete Th1 and Th17 cytokines, including interferon-gamma (IFN-g), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-17, IL-22, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). These activated T cells and the inflammatory cytokines they secrete are believed to induce the skin lesions seen in psoriasis and be a fundamental contributor in the disease’s immune pathway. We know that there are multiple approved IL-17A inhibitors on the market, such as secukinumab (Cosentyx®, Novartis) and ixekizumab (Taltz®, Eli Lilly and Co.), but these are both biologics and only indicated for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The limited patient population who are candidates for these biologic treatments is a small percentage of the overall psoriasis market. Therefore, a topical product that can inhibit the IL-17 pathway in the skin with minimal systemic exposure would be an ideal option for both physicians and patients.

Based on clinical and non-clinical data generated to date for DMT310, and anecdotal evidence of DMT310’s effect on psoriatic lesions, we completed a Phase 1b, open label, POC study in mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients in October 2021. This trial included once weekly treatments of DMT310 for 12 weeks in 30 mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients with lesions covering 2% to 30% of their body surface area. The primary endpoints in this trial were the Physician’s Global Assessment, which is a 6-point scale measuring the physician’s assessment of psoriasis severity of the target lesion site, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index scale is also a 6-point scale measuring the psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of surface area involvement and the Pruritus Visual Analog Scale consists of the patient’s measurement of pruritus, or itch, in addition to normal tolerability and safety assessments. We announced top-line results in October 2021, and based on the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile seen in the POC trial we initiated additional work to better inform the clinical trial design prior to moving into a larger Phase 2, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, which is anticipated to begin in 2022. 

DMT310 for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Rosacea 

Based on the positive clinical data we observed against inflammatory lesions in our Phase 2b acne trial and the many similarities between acne vulgaris and papulopustular rosacea, we are also developing our DMT310 product for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea, or rosacea. We believe the broad anti-inflammatory results seen by DMT310 in clinical trials for acne may also be seen in papulopustular rosacea patients, as it is also a disease of papules and pustules, which are inflammatory lesions on the face. We believe there currently remains a high unmet need in rosacea for a safe and effective treatment and we believe a once weekly, naturally derived topical product could be an ideal candidate to fill this void. Thus, in November 2021, we started enrolling moderate-to-severe rosacea patients in a Phase 2 trial of the once weekly treatment of DMT310. We expect to have top-line results in the second half of 2022.

Market Opportunity. Rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by repeated remissions and exacerbations of facial redness and inflammatory lesions that can be challenging to treat. The pathogenesis of rosacea is not completely understood, but factors such as microbial overgrowth, vascular abnormalities, and abnormally high levels of cathelicidin in the skin have been suggested to be involved. Rosacea is further divided into four subtypes: erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, rhinophymatous, and ocular, with many patients having a combination of the various subtypes. 

There are over 16 million patients diagnosed with one or more forms of rosacea in the U.S. and it typically affects women, although more severe forms tend to affect men due lack of treatment. Depending on the presenting symptoms and their severity, treatment ranges from oral antibiotics to topical preparations including brimonidine, oxymetazoline, azelaic acid and others, all with substandard efficacy and associated side effects including stinging and burning, pruritus, as well as dryness and erythema. These issues with current treatment options can often lead to discontinuation of treatment and a prolongation of symptoms and patients suffering. Even with such drawbacks to current therapies, current topical products most commonly used to treat rosacea generate approximately $374 million in aggregate annual revenues in the U.S. in 2019, while the oral drugs typically prescribed for more severe cases are oral antibiotics and generate about $305 million in aggregate annual revenues in the U.S. in 2019 according to IQVIA Inc. market data. 

Current rosacea treatments have some of the same limitations and compliance issues as current acne products, like cumbersome applications regimens and unwanted side effects. We believe this creates a large opportunity in the market for products that are easy to apply, such as DMT310. 

Limitations of Current Standard of Care. Since rosacea is a complex chronic disease combination therapy is typically required. Current topical treatment options for rosacea must be applied once or twice a day, and rosacea can have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life due both to the unwanted cosmetic appearance of the disease and intolerable and painful symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, with a once or twice a day application schedule, patients may experience side effects (such as dryness, stinging, burning, irritation and pruritis) after each treatment, resulting in poor patient compliance. Like acne, compliance with a product’s application regimen is critical in the treatment success of rosacea, especially because rosacea tends to intensify in the presence of certain environmental triggers. If left untreated, the hypertrophied tissue may require surgery to reshape and debulk the excess tissue. Despite the negative impact of the disease, very few rosacea patients seek treatment. We believe this is due to the limited treatment options available for these patients. Therefore, we believe an easy to apply once weekly treatment with minimal side effects and good tolerability could help alleviate some of the drawbacks with the current standard of care.

Our Solution for Moderate-to-Severe Rosacea. Like the needs of patients with acne, based on a recent survey of rosacea patients, many indicated a low level of satisfaction with current treatment options leading to intermittent use of current therapies. We believe that a once weekly product derived from a natural source that effectively treats the inflammation associated with papulopustular rosacea may be the ideal solution for patients suffering from this disease. The formation of rosacea lesions is thought to be driven by early recruitment of TH1 and TH17 lymphocytes which ultimately causes neutrophil infiltration and lesion formation. Once the T-cells arrive to area, T cell derived cytokines such as IL-17 may, together with UV radiation, activate keratinocytes to produce the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 and these chemokine cause neutrophils to migrate to the area, leading to the formation of inflammatory lesions. TH17 cells preferentially express the chemokine receptor CCR6, and its specific ligand CCL20 is upregulated by UVB irradiation stimulation in keratinocytes. This stimulation of the immune response by UV radiation may explain why sunlight exposure and IL-17 may exacerbate the lesions of rosacea. 

In addition to the promotion of neutrophil infiltration, IL-17 also promotes angiogenesis via the induction of VEGF, producing erythema and subsequent telangiectasia. Based on in-vitro data, DMT310 has shown a dose dependent inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F along with potent anti-inflammatory properties seen in our Phase 2b acne trial. We believe the combination of these features, coupled with a once weekly application schedule, could allow for DMT310 to be a leading treatment option for patients suffering with rosacea. 

We recently enrolled our first patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rosacea in November 2021. This trial will enroll approximately 180 patients across the U.S., where patients will be treated once weekly with a topical application of either DMT310 or placebo. Patients will be followed for 12 weeks, and the primary endpoints will include Investigator’s Global Assessment and inflammatory lesion counts along with tolerability and safety assessments. Conditioned upon the receipt of positive data from this Phase 2 trial, which we expect in the second half of 2022, we plan to hold an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2023 and then plan to initiate a Phase 3 program to prepare for an NDA submission. We expect to initiate the Phase 3 program in 2024. We will leverage the nonclinical studies completed for our acne program to help support the NDA submission for rosacea. There can be no assurance that DMT310 will receive FDA approval in rosacea. 

DMT400 for the Topical Delivery of Macromolecules 

DMT400 is our combination treatment regimen that utilizes the unique mechanical features of our Spongilla technology to facilitate the intradermal delivery of macromolecules, such as botulinum toxin, monoclonal antibodies or dermal fillers, by topical application rather than with injections. These macromolecules are highly effective and approved for the treatment of multiple medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases, but currently are not approved in a topical form because the molecular structures are too large to penetrate the stratum corneum, the skin’s outermost defense barrier. Thus, all current macromolecule treatment options for skin conditions and diseases must be injected, sometimes requiring numerous injections. We believe that DMT400’s topical application regimen may provide patients with a topical treatment option for both medical and aesthetic dermatology conditions using products previously unavailable to them in a topical treatment. 

DMT400 works by first topically applying our proprietary sponge powder to the treatment area wherein the mechanical spicules of the sponge penetrate the skin thereby creating microchannels into the dermis. Unlike a derma roller or other microneedle technology, our unique spicules remain in the skin for one to two days allowing the microchannel to remain open rather than close, as they would after using a derma roller, during which time a macromolecule can be applied topically to the skin. We believe this topical application of a macromolecule can be massaged into the newly created microchannels thereby facilitating the delivery of the macromolecule, through the microchannel and into the dermis, without the need for injections. This targeted delivery to the dermis rather than delivery to the systemic circulation, may decrease the systemic spread of these macromolecules thus potentially reducing side effects seen with injections, while increasing targeted application to where the disease resides.

DMT410 for the Treatment of Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis 

We initially tested our DMT400 treatment with our DMT410 program, which consists of a topical application of our proprietary sponge powder followed by a topical application of botulinum toxin. DMT410 was initially tested in a Phase 1b POC trial of ten (10) patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis to determine if our Spongilla sponge powder could successfully facilitate the intradermal delivery of botulinum toxin and potentially other macromolecules. Based on the results seen from this study we believe we were successful in delivering active botulinum toxin to the dermis for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. 

Market Opportunity. Hyperhidrosis is a life-altering disorder of excessive sweating out of proportion with thermoregulatory requirements. While many patients may exhibit this excessive sweating in response to specific triggers, such as emotional stress, others may exhibit symptoms spontaneously. Typically, the diagnosis of hyperhidrosis is based partly on subjective measures that measure how the excessive sweating affects a patient’s quality of life. Physicians also gravimetrically measure the amount of sweat produced, though there is no standardized threshold which defines hyperhidrosis. It is believed to affect an estimated 15 million people in the U.S. alone. According to a 2016 update on the prevalence and severity of hyperhidrosis in the U.S., axillary (underarm) hyperhidrosis, is the most common form of the disorder. However, patients are affected by other forms like palmar (hands) and plantar (feet) hyperhidrosis, which we believe DMT410 may be able to treat and avoid the side effects seen in studies of poor administration of intradermal injections. 
Limitations of Current Standards of Care. While the prevalence of hyperhidrosis is significant, treatment options are limited, and many come with unwanted side effects making patient acceptance low. Typical first line therapy is usually with aluminum chloride-based antiperspirants, but many have potential drawbacks. First, daily applications can be time consuming leading to poor compliance among patients. Second, many antiperspirants are irritating to the skin leading to treatment discontinuation. Lastly, topical aluminum chloride treatment has a transient duration of effect and requires frequent reapplication to maintain sweat control. More recently, topical anticholinergics have been investigated by companies such as Brickell Biotech, Inc. and Journey Medical Corporation (formerly developed by Dermira, Inc.), but we believe they tend to have the same side effects as systemic anticholinergics which are used off-label. These side effects include dry mouth, dry eyes, blurred vision, headache, urinary retention, among others. The unwanted side effects are often so intolerable that up to one third of patients are forced to withdraw from treatment. If topical or systemic treatments fail, then patients can get intradermal injections of botulinum toxin which has been shown to have a great treatment effect, but treatment is very technique driven, requiring a trained physician to administer the toxin to the thin layer of the dermis. Many times, poor treatment response with botulinum toxin is due to incorrect or insufficient dosing or incorrect administration. Patients may also experience injection site pain or discomfort, which may be accompanied by swelling and bruising. However, for the treatment of palmar hyperhidrosis with intradermal injections of botulinum toxin, the most notable adverse event is transient hand weakness, if administered incorrectly. As a last resort, patients may also seek surgery to treat their hyperhidrosis, if less invasive treatment options fail. While there are treatment options available for hyperhidrosis patients, only about half of affected individuals seek treatment due to social embarrassment associated with the diagnosis of the disease. We believe this leaves a wide gap in the market for a product that combines the efficacy of botulinum toxin with the safety and tolerability profile of topical therapies. We believe DMT410, if successfully commercialized, could address this market opportunity. 

Our Solution for Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis. While primary axillary hyperhidrosis is idiopathic, the mechanism is thought to be neurogenic overactivity of the eccrine (sweat) glands in the affected area. Based on the summary basis for approval of BOTOX, we know that botulinum toxin type A has a clinical effect on hyperhidrosis, which acts by disrupting sympathetic stimulation to the eccrine glands resulting in considerably reduced axillary sweating from four to 12 months. Based on the package insert for BOTOX, intradermal injections of 50 units of BOTOX saw a greater than 50% decrease in axillary sweat production in 81% and 41% of patients treated with BOTOX or placebo, respectively, at four weeks. While intradermal injections of botulinum toxin appear to be very effective, the treatment requires multiple injections into each axilla, which is time consuming for the treating physician and administration is very technique sensitive due to the thin nature of the dermis. Additionally, given the nature of the target tissue being more sensitive, and the number of injections required, it is believed that injection site pain is a major cause for the lack of compliance. Thus, we believe a topical application regimen, capable of penetrating the stratum corneum to deliver botulinum toxin into the dermis, may be able to exhibit similar efficacy with greater compliance and adoption. In a Phase 1b POC study of DMT410 for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis, we saw a greater than 50% decrease in axillary sweat production in 80% of patients at week four. This result supports our belief that topical application of botulinum toxin via our Spongilla technology to the dermis could be a viable alternative to intradermal injections. If approved, DMT410 could eliminate the need for intradermal injections of botulinum toxin. Therefore, we believe DMT410 could potentially be a favorable treatment option for patients suffering with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Additionally, we also believe that DMT410 may be an effective treatment for palmar or plantar hyperhidrosis due to DMT410’s delivery of botulinum toxin to the dermis without the risk of distance spread of toxin to the muscle as with intradermal injections of botulinum toxin. DMT410 could limit the side effects seen with intradermal injections including hand weakness and administration pain. There can be no assurance that DMT410 will receive FDA approval for hyperhidrosis.

DMT410 for the Treatment of Aesthetic Conditions In addition to the use of DMT410 in the treatment of hyperhidrosis and other medical dermatology conditions such as acne and rosacea, based on the data from our recent Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions such as pore size, sebum production, fine lines, luminosity, and brightness of the skin, we believe DMT410 has an opportunity to be used for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions. Botulinum toxin is known to treat a variety of aesthetic skin conditions, but to achieve these positive effects, the botulinum toxin needs to be delivered to the dermis rather than the muscle to have the desired effect. DMT410’s uniquely sized spicules create microchannels through the stratum corneum and into the dermis that are large enough for botulinum toxin to be delivered to the dermis. However, the spicules are not long enough to reach the muscle layer, which limits the potential distant spread of toxin and potential side effects. Botulinum toxin acts by blocking the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, where it binds to a cholinergic receptor, thereby inhibiting sympathetic nerve function. This ability to inhibit cholinergic transmission makes it useful to treat indications with glandular hypersecretion, like sebum production or hyperhidrosis, which are partly caused by hyperactive sympathetic nerves. For aesthetic indications, since botulinum toxin must be delivered to the dermis, intradermal injections are typically required but can require numerous injections in order to cover the larger surface area to treat these aesthetic skin conditions as compared to targeted injections to the muscle. Intradermal injections can also be difficult to effectively administer, and may be painful for patients. This tends to lead to poor adoption of this therapy, which is why we believe there are currently no approved aesthetic indications utilizing intradermal injections. Additionally, no topical formulations of a botulinum toxin have been approved, likely due to the size of the molecule and its difficulty in penetrating the stratum corneum to reach the dermis. Therefore, with no currently approved intradermal injections or topical applications methods of botulinum toxin for aesthetic skin conditions, we believe there is a large market opportunity for a product that can successfully deliver botulinum toxin by topical application into the dermis to improve a patient’s aesthetic appearance. If approved, we believe DMT410 can address this market.

Limitations of Standards of Care While injections of botulinum toxin into the muscles have been approved for many years for aesthetic treatments such as the reduction of glabellar, lateral canthal or forehead lines, there are many other aesthetic skin conditions, such as enlarged pore size, excess sebum production, fine lines, decreased luminosity, and decreased brightness that botulinum toxin has been demonstrated to improve but a botulinum toxin product, whether via intradermal injections or topical application, has yet to be approved for these indications. This may be because these aesthetic indications typically require botulinum toxin to be delivered to the dermis rather than the muscle, which due to the thin nature of the dermis, can be more difficult than injecting into the muscle. Additionally, the areas of the face requiring intradermal injections are much more sensitive and thus can be more painful for patients. These intradermal aesthetic indications typically require a wider dispersion of botulinum toxin to be delivered to the dermis rather than the few injections into the muscle needed for the deeper facial lines. Some intradermal studies have required 25-30 intradermal injections in the face to deliver sufficient quantities of botulinum toxin to the dermis. With some patients having a fear of needles, a treatment that can avoid the use of needles would be desirable for this population. Additionally, topical application of botulinum toxin has been difficult due to the size of the molecule making it difficult for the botulinum toxin to penetrate the stratum corneum, resulting in many topical applications being ineffective and discontinued. An example is Revance’s RT001 product which did not achieve the primary or other secondary endpoints in a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of crow’s feet and therefore, Revance does not plan to continue development of this program at this time. Another botulinum toxin company, Allergan (now part of AbbVie), purchased a company in 2016 to pursue development of a topical botulinum toxin program. However, Allergan has not conducted any studies with this program. We believe most botulinum toxin companies remain interested in developing a topical means of administering botulinum toxin that is less painful, easy to apply, provides wider coverage of toxin, and limits potential distant spread of toxin, but no product has yet been successfully developed.

Our Solution for the Treatment of Aesthetic Skin Conditions We believe a product candidate like DMT410, which may be able to successfully deliver botulinum toxin to the dermis covering a larger facial area than injections, would provide a new treatment option for a variety of aesthetic skin conditions, such as reduction in pore size, sebum production, and fine lines, and improvement in skin luminosity and brightness, thus potentially expanding the market for uses of botulinum toxin beyond injections into the muscle for treatment of deep lines. We believe DMT410 may be able to provide patients with a topical treatment option without the pain and discomfort typically associated with injections of botulinum toxin. Additionally, we believe administration will be easier and less time consuming for dermatologist, making it an additional value driven treatment option they can offer. While current botulinum toxins are approved for injections into the facial muscles to treat deeper wrinkles such as glabellar lines, lateral canthal lines and forehead lines, there remain many other aesthetic conditions of the face which could greatly benefit from an intradermal administration of botulinum toxin, especially via topical application. Certain aesthetic indications such as reduction in fine lines, pore size, and sebum production, and improvement in luminosity and brightness are typically not treated with injections into the muscles but need botulinum toxin to be delivered to the dermis to have the proper effect. With DMT410’s uniquely sized spicules, we believe it can create numerous microchannels into the dermis allowing a pathway for the topical application of botulinum toxin. Once in the dermis botulinum toxin is able to act on reducing sebum production which in turn may reduce pore size and overall oiliness of the skin. Additionally, botulinum toxin has been demonstrated to have a beneficial effect on the mean volume and depth of facial lines giving the skin a smoother appearance. Therefore, we believe there may be a need for a product, such as DMT410, that can facilitate the topical application of botulinum toxin into the dermis, to treat a variety of these aesthetic skin conditions.

If approved, we believe DMT410 has the potential to expand the market for botulinum toxins’ treatment to multiple additional aesthetic skin conditions. We believe DMT410 can be an effective product at delivering bioactive botulinum toxin with a topical application for treatment of pore size, sebum production, fine lines, luminosity, brightness, overall aesthetic appearance and possibly more. We recently completed a Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions where we examined improvements in pore size, sebum product, luminosity, brightness, and Global Aesthetic improvement after one treatment of DMT410. We believe this POC trial produced data which demonstrated that DMT410 was able to deliver botulinum toxin to the dermis and showed a reduction in pore size, reduce sebum production, improved luminosity, improved brightness, and improved the patients’ Global Aesthetics. This study also produced no adverse events and provided acceptable tolerability data with only mild tolerability effects seen fifteen (15) minutes post treatment. We believe this data warrants further development of this program and we are currently seeking a partner who has a botulinum toxin they are looking to develop for aesthetic skin conditions which require delivery of botulinum toxin to the dermis. There can be no assurance that DMT410 will receive FDA approval for any aesthetic indication or that we will be able to find a partner for development.

DMT310 Phase 2b Clinical Results for Acne

In June 2020, we received results from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial of once weekly treatments for twelve weeks of DMT310 for acne. We enrolled 181 moderate-to-severe acne patients at fourteen (14) sites across the U.S. Patients were required to be 12 years of age or older, have at least twenty (20) non-inflammatory lesions, twenty (20) inflammatory lesions, no more than two (2) nodules or cysts and be a moderate or severe (meaning a 3 or 4) on the IGA scale of acne. The IGA scale consists of a 5-point scale, 0-4, with 0 being clear, 1 being almost clear and 4 being severe acne as graded by the treating physician. Patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups, either to receive DMT310 or placebo. Patients were required to apply the product, whether DMT310 or placebo, to the entire face, once weekly for 12 weeks with the first two weeks of treatment applied in office under the supervision of trained study staff, then the remaining 10 weekly treatments were applied at home by the patient. 

20


The primary clinical endpoints of the trial included the absolute reduction in inflammatory lesions from baseline. The secondary clinical endpoints included: 


· | the absolute reduction in non-inflammatory lesions from baseline; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the IGA with a responder being a patient with a 2-grade change in IGA scale and being a 0 or 1 at study exit; and
· | safety and tolerability. 


All statistical analyses and data shown for our Phase 2b study are on the intent-to-treat, or ITT, population. The ITT population included all randomized subjects in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of study drug received or if they completed the study. The ITT approach provides an unbiased comparison among the treatment groups. 

The trial was completed in June 2020 and showed a statistically significant and we believe, a clinically meaningful effect for all efficacy endpoints of the trial, namely reduction in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions and IGA responders. Notably, the treatment effect for all efficacy endpoints was statistically significant at the four-week mark, after only four treatments, and continued to be statistically significant for week eight and week 12 when compared with placebo. Patients saw a rapid and sustained therapeutics treatment effect in percentage change in inflammatory lesions with a 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions at week four and reached 62% reduction in inflammatory lesions at week 12 compared to 24% and 42% reduction of inflammatory lesions for placebo at weeks four and 12, respectively. The effect on non-inflammatory lesions were also statistically significant after four weeks, with the therapeutic effect of an approximately 36% reduction in non-inflammatory lesions at week four reaching a therapeutic effect of 58% at 12 weeks, which was statistically significant when compared with placebo. In addition, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory percent reduction in lesion counts had P-values of less than 0.001 at week four and week 12 when compared to placebo. 

We also saw an early statistically significant separation in IGA with 15% of patients in the DMT310 group considered responders on the IGA scale, or who had an IGA score of 0, “clear,” or 1, “almost clear,” after only 4 treatments as compared with just over 2% of patients on placebo. This statistical separation continued for the remainder of the trial where at the completion of the trial, or week 12, 44% of patients in the DMT310 group, compared with 17% in the placebo group were IGA responders. This difference was statistically significant with a P-value of less than 0.001. 

No reported drug-related severe adverse events were reported in the trial. The drug also appeared to be tolerable by a majority of patients with greater than 92% of patients experiencing no or mild tolerability with no severe dryness, scaling, erythema, or burning/stinging reported at week 12. Of those patients who did report tolerability issues, they also reported that the issues were usually transient and resolved quickly without intervention. Based on this data, after meeting with the FDA, we expect to proceed to Phase 3 clinical trials with the same clinical endpoints and the same formulation of DMT310 for moderate-to-severe acne. 

The following diagrams and tables show the absolute reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions from baseline until the end of study, or week 12, for both DMT310 and placebo (Image 3), and percent reduction of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions from baseline until end of study, or week 12, for both DMT310 and Placebo (Image 4). Although reduction in non-inflammatory lesions was a secondary endpoint of this trial, it is a required metric for the Phase 3 acne studies necessary for FDA approval.

(1) | As used in the diagrams and table above, the reference to “P-value” (relative to placebo) means the probability of being wrong when asserting that a true difference exists between the results for the relevant patient group and the placebo group. For example, a “P-value” of less than 0.001 indicates that there is a less than one in 10,000 chance that the observed result in the treatment group and the observed result in the placebo group are the same. A “P-value” equal to or less than 0.05 means that a given difference is statistically significant.

(2) | “Success” is defined as an IGA score of “clear” or “almost clear” upon completion of the study.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additionally, the safety and tolerability profile of DMT310 appeared to be acceptable with a small number of patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events as seen in Image 6 below. In this Phase 2b trial, no subject receiving treatment with DMT310 experienced a severe local skin reaction at study end nor did any patient undergo a dose modification. Most tolerability issues were mild and resolved shortly after application without any rescue medication as seen in Image 7 below. Overall, DMT310 was generally safe and well tolerated by patients when applied once weekly for 12 weeks. 


System Organ Class Preferred Team | DMT310 (N=91)N (%) | Placebo (N=90)N (%)

DMT310 Phase 2a Clinical Results for Acne

In 2018 we conducted the first clinical trial of DMT310, a randomized, double-blind, 2x2 factorial, placebo-controlled, Phase 2a clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of acne. We enrolled 121 patients to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of DMT310 mixed with 3% H2O2 following 12 weeks of topical administration in male and female patients with moderate-to-severe facial acne. The study employed a 2x2 factorial design to assess the contribution of each component of the investigational product (i.e., Spongilla lacustris topical powder and 3% H2O2 USP). This Phase 2a clinical trial employed the same clinical endpoints as our Phase 2b clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of acne, as discussed above. 

Patients were randomly divided into one of four treatment groups, DMT310 + 3% H2O2, DMT310 + Water, Placebo + 3% H2O2, or Placebo + Water (control). The patients were required to apply the assigned study drug to their entire face up to once weekly for 12 weeks (84 days), beginning on Day 1 and through Day 78 (as applicable). During study center visits on Days 29 and 57, a determination was made for each patient, based on the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score, as to whether study drug application would continue once weekly or at a lower biweekly frequency (once every 2 weeks). Specifically, patients with an IGA > 1 at the Day 29 or Day 57 visits continued with once weekly study drug applications, while patients with an IGA 1 at these same visits were instructed to subsequently apply their assigned study drug biweekly (see Image 8 below for a presentation of the study drug application frequency algorithm). 


24

Image 8 Application Frequency Algorithm by Study Visit

This Phase 2a trial showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful effects for its endpoint, absolute reduction in inflammatory lesions when comparing DMT310 + 3% H2O2 and placebo + water (control) groups at both week 8 and week 12 or end of study. At week 12, DMT310 + 3% H2O2 had a 16-lesion reduction from baseline while placebo + water had an 11 lesion reduction from baseline, with a p-value of less than 0.05. Across all the treatment groups, there was a mean decrease from baseline (i.e., improvement) in the inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts at Days 15, 29, 57, and 85. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the DMT310 + 3% H2O2 group versus the placebo + water (control) group for the mean changes from baseline in non-inflammatory lesion counts. 

We did not observe a statistically significant difference between the DMT310 + 3% H2O2 group and the placebo + water (control) group in the percentages of patients with IGA treatment success (IGA score of 1 or 0 and a 2-grade change) or patients with 1-grade or 2-grade improvements from baseline in IGA at any visit. At Day 85 in the DMT310 + 3% H2O2, DMT310 + water, placebo + 3% H2O2, and placebo + water groups, 29.6%, 20.0%, 27.6%, and 34.5% of patients had IGA treatment responders, respectively; 66.7%, 66.7%, 65.5%, and 55.2% of subjects had a 1-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA, respectively; and 37.0%, 20.0%, 27.6%, and 34.5% of subjects had a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA, respectively. 

Analysis of Placebo: After speaking with the clinical investigators in the trial, it was determined that the higher than normal placebo response in non-inflammatory lesions may have been partially due to the stickiness of the placebo, which required patient to scrub their face, resulting in exfoliation of the skin and removal of sebaceous plugs (whiteheads and blackheads), thereby reducing non-inflammatory lesion counts. We believe this caused a placebo response rate that was much higher than the placebo response rates seen in other topical Phase 2 acne trials. As a result of the inadequate placebo, we developed a new proprietary placebo formulation for our Phase 2b clinical trial. 

25


Once weekly vs. Biweekly Treatment Schedule: Due to this being the first time DMT310 was studied in moderate-to-severe acne patients for 12 weeks, a conservative study design was chosen to ensure patient tolerability and safety while attempting to maintain efficacy. Therefore, we allowed IGA treatment responders (IGA score of 0 or 1) to move to a biweekly or every other week application schedule as discussed above. This resulted in 3 out of 27 patients in the DMT310 + 3% H2O2 group and 0 out of 29 patients in the placebo + water group moving from an IGA score of 1 (treatment responder) at week 8 and regressing to an IGA score of 2 (treatment failure) at week 12. Therefore, our Phase 2b clinical trial of DMT310 in moderate-to-severe acne patients incorporated only once weekly applications for 12 weeks with no biweekly option. 

No statistical or clinical difference was seen between the placebo + 3% H2O2 and the placebo + water groups, which we believe indicates that 3% H2O2 by itself does not have a treatment effect. 

DMT310 next steps for acne

We are currently preceding with the necessary non-clinical and pharmacokinetic studies and once complete we plan to schedule an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2023 to discuss and finalize the protocol for the Phase 3 clinical trials in moderate-to-severe acne. 

Once we are able to hold an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and we receive approval to proceed with Phase 3, we plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 program for DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. We expect this Phase 3 program to include two, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials with identical clinical endpoints to our recently successful Phase 2b clinical trial of DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. We expect to report top-line data from this program in 2024 and, assuming positive results, file a new drug application, or NDA, with the FDA shortly thereafter. This Phase 3 program is intended to be designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the treatment of DMT310 relative to placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. Prior to, or in parallel with our planned Phase 3 program, we intend to continue conducting and complete the additional non-clinical studies necessary to file the NDA. We also intend to conduct a long-term safety study. If DMT310 is approved for the treatment of acne, we believe DMT310 can eventually be an attractive prescription to over-the-counter switch, or Rx-to-OTC, target, which could provide a substantially larger sales opportunity. There can be no assurance that DMT310 will receive FDA approval for the treatment of acne. 

DMT310 Phase 1a Clinical Results for Psoriasis

We recently completed a Phase 1a POC trial of DMT310 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. This was an open-label, multi-center, 12-week study in 30 mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients with psoriatic lesions coving between 2-30% of body surface area. The trial aimed at evaluating the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of once weekly treatments of DMT310, which consists of 2 grams of Spongilla powder mixed with 6 mL of 3% H2O2. One mild or moderate lesion was selected, and patients were required to apply DMT310 to the entire lesion, once weekly for 12 weeks with the first two weeks of treatment applied in office under the supervision of trained staff, then the remaining 10 weekly treatments were applied at home by the patient.

The endpoints in this study included:


• | Physicians Global Assessment (PGA) of disease severity with success defined as absent or very mild disease, a score of 0 or 1 respectively on a 5-point scale, at the target lesion site. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) at the target lesion site defined as absent or mild, a score of 0 or 1 respectively, on a 6-point scale. This required each psoriatic sign of scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation to have a score of 0 or 1 for the subject to be considered a responder.
• | Pruritus Visual Analog Scale (VAS) looking at the mean change and percent change from baseline in pruritis (itch). 


26


All efficacy analyses were performed using the As-Treated population, which consists of all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study medication and the per protocol population, which consists of all enrolled patients with no significant protocol violations during the study that would affect the efficacy analyses.

The trial was completed in August 2021 and showed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile that we believe is clinically meaningful and warrants further investigation of DMT310 as a potential treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. DMT310 was able to achieve a PGA score of 0 or 1 for the target lesion in 29.6% of patients at week 8. DMT310 also demonstrated a total PASI score of 0 or 1 for the target lesion in 25.9% of patients at week 8. Notably, DMT310 demonstrated a 19.6% reduction from baseline in pruritus (itch) at week 8 with a peek reduction of 22.5%. We believe these findings from a POC trial are encouraging for the potential use of DMT310 as an easy to apply topical treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. 

No reported drug-related severe adverse events were reported in the trial and only two treatment emergent adverse events were reported, both being application site pruritus. Additionally, the drug also appeared to be tolerated by a majority of patients. Of those patients who did report tolerability issues, they also reported that the issues were usually transient and resolved quickly without intervention.

DMT310 next steps for psoriasis

We are pleased with data already seen in our Phase 1 POC trial, especially seeing a reduction in itch as that is one of the main complaints of patients suffering from psoriasis. We are currently in the process of designing a Phase 2 study of DMT310 for the treatment of psoriasis. The Phase 2 study will be a larger randomized, double-blind, placebo control study of DMT310 for the treatment of psoriasis. Based on the data from the Phase 1b proof of concept study we are considering adding additional arms to examine once versus twice weekly treatment, potentially enhancing the treatment effect seen in our Phase 1b trial. Additionally, due to the unique nature of psoriasis and the general thickness of psoriatic plaques, we may also examine increasing the application pressure and the length of application. We believe that the thicker psoriatic plaques may require a more intensive treatment compared to the application regimen for acne where there is no thickened skin. We believe DMT310 could be a first in class treatment option for psoriasis patients and plan to initiate the Phase 2 trial in 2022 with top-line results expected in 2023. There can be no assurance that DMT310 will receive FDA approval for the treatment of psoriasis.

DMT410 Phase 1b-Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis 

In the first quarter of 2019, we completed a Phase 1b, open-label, POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis. In this study we treated ten (10) patients with one application of our proprietary sponge powder followed by one topical application of BOTOX, reconstituted per label, to each axilla. Patients were followed for 4 weeks after which time their sweat production was measured and compared with baseline measurements. 

The endpoints for this trial included:


• | percent of patients with less than 50% reduction in gravimetrically measured sweat production from baseline,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | percent of patients with gravimetric sweat production of greater than 50 mg, and 
• | percentage change in gravimetric sweat production. 


After 4 weeks, 80% of patients saw a decrease in gravimetric sweat production greater than 50%, 85% of patients had gravimetric sweat production of less than 50mg, and patients had a 75% decrease in gravimetric sweat product from baseline. Based on this clinical data, we believe that we were able to deliver botulinum toxin into the dermis through topical application for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Treatment with DMT410 also had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. We plan to partner with a botulinum toxin to run a larger Phase 2 study of DMT410 for axillary hyperhidrosis and possibly for palmar (hand) or plantar (foot) hyperhidrosis where there is currently no approved product. There can be no assurances that DMT410 will receive FDA approval for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. 

DMT410 Phase 1b— Upper Facial Lines 

In November 2020, we enrolled our first patient in a Phase 1b open-label, POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of upper facial lines along with multiple other aesthetic skin conditions that are affected by delivery of toxin to the dermis such as pore size, sebum production, brightness, luminosity, fine lines, and Global Aesthetic Improvement. Due to the fact that we do not own rights to a botulinum toxin product, we were required by the FDA to conduct this trial using an approved indication for BOTOX, upper facial lines, an approved dose for this indication (64 units of botulinum toxin) and an approved route of administration, which is typically injections into the muscle rather than the dermis. However, we were interested in studying the clinical effect of DMT410 for the aesthetic skin conditions that require delivery of botulinum toxin to the dermis rather than the muscle, because of our belief that DMT410 only delivers botulinum toxin to the dermis and not the muscle. With these constraints, we initiated the POC trial by enrolling ten (10) female patients, age 18 or older, each receiving one treatment of DMT410, consisting of one topical application of our proprietary sponge powder followed by one topical application for BOTOX, reconstituted per label, to the upper face. Patients were followed for sixteen (16) weeks to determine the achievement of our endpoints along with the duration of effect. We also collected safety and tolerability data. We received top-line data from this study in the November 2021, and believe that we achieved results in multiple aesthetic endpoints sufficient to warrant further investigation of DM410 for the treatment of various aesthetic skin conditions. 

28


The endpoints for this trial were:


• | Portion of patients achieving a grade of none or mild on the investigator’s assessment of lateral canthal, forehead, and glabellar lines based on the Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS), which consists of a 5-point scale with 0 being none and 1 being almost none. To be considered a responder, both the patient and physician had to agree on the score. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Portion of patients achieving improvement on the physician’s assessment of pore size improvement, based on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), which consists of a 5-point scale with 0 being no improvement, 1 being less than or equal to 25% improvement, 2 being a 26-50% improvement, 3 being a 51-75% improvement, and 4 being a 76-100% improvement.
• | Mean and percent change from baseline in brightness based on the 10-point visual analog scale. 
• | Mean and percent change from baseline in luminosity based on the 10-point visual analog scale. 
• | Portion of patients achieving a two- grade improvement on the physician’s assessment of FWS of fine lines under the eye. 


The efficacy analysis was conducted on the ITT and Per Protocol (PP), meaning all patients completing the study without a major protocol violation, populations. In addition to the physician measured endpoints listed above, we also implemented 2-dimensional VISIA and 3-dimensional PRIMOS imaging technology from Canfield Scientific to provide objective analysis of many of the aesthetic endpoints. 

Based on the assessment of forehead, lateral canthal, and glabellar lines, no patient was considered a responder in this study, while some patients did achieve at least a one-grade change throughout the course of the study. This result was not unexpected as BOTOX is only approved for injections into the muscle and we did not believe that we would see any potential distant spread of toxin outside of the dermis. Seeing no potential distant spread of toxin was encouraging for us as it provides important safety data that while DMT410 can be applied over a larger treatment area than injections, it does not appear to travel beyond the dermis which may cause unwanted facial effects.

We believe the real potential of DMT410 lies in the aesthetic endpoints that can be affected by delivering BOTOX to the dermis rather than the muscles. These clinical endpoints include pore size, global aesthetic improvement, brightness, luminosity, and fine lines. The following table (Image 10) shows the improvements in pore size, or a decrease in overall pore size, with patients achieving at least a 25% improvement in pore size, for assessment of GAI, or the overall improvement in skin quality, the with patients achieving at least a 25% improvement in GAI, for assessment of brightness, or the skin’s combined uniformity of color and texture, with patients having at least a 1-point improvement in brightness, and for assessment of luminosity, or the intensity of light area reflected off the face, with patients having at least a 1-point improvement in brightness.

In addition to the physician measured endpoints, we also utilized Canfield Scientific’s 2-dimensional VISIA and 3-dimensional PRIMOS imaging technologies to gather additional objective data on some of the key endpoints. Based on the VISIA system patients saw a 14.1% reduction in pore count and a 14.3% reduction in pore area at week 4. Patients also saw a 16.5% reduction in wrinkle count and a 11.5% reduction in wrinkle area at week 4. Using the PRIMOS image analysis patients saw a percent decrease in mean line, which consist of the deeper facial lines, of 12.1% and a percent change in mean roughness, which consists of the superficial fine lines, of 6.5%. We believe the subjective effects seen by the treating physicians were further validated by the objective measures using Canfield camera systems.

No reported drug-related adverse events were reported in the trial. The drug appeared to be well tolerated by patients, with only mild stinging and erythema reported 15 minutes after treatment and no tolerability issues reported at week 4, 8, 12 or 16.

DMT410 next steps for aesthetics

We are very encouraged by the results from our Phase 1b POC trial of DMT410 for the treatment of multiple aesthetic skin conditions. This was designed to be a signal detection trial of DMT410 for the treatment of a variety of aesthetic skin conditions based on the clinical trial design constraints, including the limitation on the quantity of BOTOX that we were able to apply, the clinical endpoints that needed to be included, and the area of the face that could be treated. Even with these limitations we believe that we achieved results sufficient to warrant the continued development of this program as there remains no approved botulinum toxin, whether via injection or topical, to treat many of the endpoints in which we saw a treatment effect. We believe this is further supported by the fact that many of the endpoints saw an improvement by week eight (8) or twelve (12) and started to return towards baseline at week 16. This is consistent with the knowledge that BOTOX lasts for about three (3) months before the effect begins to fade. We believe that if we can conduct a larger Phase 2 clinical trial that consists of multiple doses of botulinum toxin, we will be able to find the optimal dose for the treatment of a variety of aesthetic skin conditions including pore size, sebum production, fine lines, luminosity, brightness, and overall aesthetic improvement. We know that botulinum toxin has shown efficacy of these endpoints but there has been very little research conducted on the optimal dose or administration procedure, likely due to challenges with intradermal injections and the lack of topical applications that can effectively deliver botulinum toxin to a large enough treatment area as required to treat many of these aesthetic skin conditions. We believe DMT410 can meet this need as shown by our Phase 1b data, so we are actively seeking a partnership with a botulinum toxin company that is interesting in helping us further develop our DMT410 program for multiple aesthetic skin conditions. There can be no assurances that we are able to successfully negotiate a partnership with a botulinum toxin company or that DMT410 will receive FDA approval for the treatment any aesthetic skin conditions.

Manufacturing 

We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities and do not plan to own any in the near future. We have been relying on our third-party partners for the manufacture of our products used in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, and will likely continue to rely on these partners in the near term for the commercial manufacturing of our drug substance and drug product, if our drug product candidates are approved. Manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for our product candidates requires a raw material that is derived from a natural source. 

To date, we have obtained naturally sourced Spongilla raw material directly from our supplier based in Russia. In February 2020, we signed an exclusive supply agreement with this supplier of Spongilla raw material. Our supplier has over 18 years of experience collecting and processing Spongilla and has the capacity to collect and process large quantities of Spongilla per year. We believe our supplier is able to harvest sufficient quantities of raw material to fulfill our development and potential commercial needs, if a product candidate is approved using this raw material. However, we are exploring alternative manufacturing sources in order to ensure that we have access to sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet potential demand for any of our product candidates in a cost-efficient manner. See “Business—Material Agreements— Supply Agreement between Dermata Therapeutics LLC and Reka-Farm LLC” for more information regarding our supply of Spongilla.

Development and commercial quantities of any drug product candidates that we may develop will need to be harvested, manufactured in facilities, and processed in compliance with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. The relevant manufacturers of our drug product candidates have advised us that they are in compliance with both current Good Laboratory Practices, or cGLP, and cGMP. 

We have relied upon our complete supply chain while supporting both our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical supply requirements and we are confident that our manufacturers have the ability to scale our processes to support our Phase 3 clinical studies and future commercial commitments. Our suppliers and manufactures were specifically selected based on the capabilities of their organization, their compliance to regulations, their personnel and the type and capabilities of their equipment. Testing methods for each stage of the manufacturing process form acquisition of raw materials through production of finished drug product have been developed and satisfactorily qualified per the FDA’s phase appropriate regulations relating to clinical materials for human use. Analytical methods and operational procedures related to each stage of our production operations including product release will continue to evolve and be validated as part of our overall development plan for Phase 3 clinical supplies and commercial production. 

Commercialization 

Given our stage of development, we do not currently have any internal sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure or capabilities. If approved, we intend to commercialize DMT310, or any other product candidates that we may successfully develop, in the United States by building a specialized sales organization focused on dermatologists. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 50-60 sales representatives would allow us to reach our targeted dermatologists in the U.S. with the highest potential for prescribing DMT310. In the future, we may develop and commercialize DMT310 for additional geographic regions, independently or with a strategic partner. If DMT310 is approved, and we are able to successfully commercialize it, we believe DMT310 can eventually become an attractive Rx-to-OTC switch target, which could provide a substantially larger addressable market and an expanded sales opportunity. 
Competition 

The medical and aesthetic pharmaceutical industries in which we plan to operate are competitive and subject to changes in practice. While we believe that our unique natural technology, knowledge, experience and resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from many different sources with respect to our current programs or any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Possible competitors may include pharmaceutical companies, academic and medical institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. These prospective competitors have the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers. 

Many of our prospective competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel, and marketing resources than we do. Our prospective competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition to product development, testing, approval and promotion, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include industry consolidation, product quality and price, product technology, reputation, customer service and access to technical information. As a result, our prospective competitors may be able to develop competing or superior products, and compete more aggressively and sustain their competitive advantage over a longer period of time than us. Our products may be rendered obsolete or may lack economic viability in the face of competition. 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of DMT310, if approved, will likely be its efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. With respect to DMT310 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne, if approved, we will primarily be competing with therapies such as other topical products, oral products, in-office procedures, such as laser surgery, off-label drugs, over the counter medication and homeopathic remedies. With regards to DMT310 for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis, if approved, we will face competition from topical therapies, oral therapies, systemic therapies, photo therapies and homeopathic treatments. However, based on our clinical trials, we believe that DMT310 has multiple competitive advantages over current treatment alternatives with significantly less adverse side effects. Our main competition in these indications will be with products from Vyne Therapeutics, Inc, Sol-Gel Technologies Ltd., Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc., Almirall S.A., Galderma S.A., Pfizer Inc. See “Business – Clinical Progress of our Lead Product Candidates” for the results of our completed and ongoing clinical trials. While we are unaware of any potential similar competitive topical products to DMT310 for the treatment of acne, psoriasis, and rosacea, it is possible that such potentially similar competitive products are currently being developed.

We are also in early stages of clinical development for DMT410 for treating various medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases, and if we obtain marketing approval in the future, we will compete with traditional therapies, such as topical products, oral products, in-office procedures, such as botulinum toxin injections, off-label drugs, over the counter medication and homeopathic remedies, as well as additional new entrants to the applicable markets. 

We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidate portfolio in our target commercial markets. 

Intellectual Property 

Overview 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for DMT310, DMT410 and any of our future product candidates, medical devices, methodologies, assays, drug development technologies, harvesting procedures, know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our strategy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our product candidate and other proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovations, exclusivity agreements, nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, license agreements, assignment of inventions and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
Patent Portfolio 

Our patent estate consists of in-licensed and solely owned patent applications. Typically, we initially file U.S. provisional patent applications and then file applications directly or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, which is an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing a single initial patent application to seek patent protection from an invention simultaneously in any one of the designated member jurisdictions and states, including in the U.S. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications filed at a later date. We currently have multiple patent or patent applications in our patent portfolio and continue to pursue and seek additional patent coverage of all our product candidates. 

DMT310 

Our DMT310 portfolio includes two families, one in-licensed and one owned by Dermata. The in-licensed family includes patents and patent applications in-licensed from Villani, Inc. related to therapeutic compositions and methods for treating skin conditions. The in-licensed portfolio consists of one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application, two granted U.S. patents, and granted foreign patents in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, the issued foreign patent in Japan, has lapsed and is no longer in force or valid. These patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2023, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Based on the anticipated timing of any potential FDA approval of DMT310 for acne, the patents that expire in 2022 and 2023 are not material to our business, as we do not expect these patents to provide any protection for our product candidates. We expect our intellectual property portfolio to be protected by any potential NCE exclusivity for DMT310 and our other product candidates, the maintaining of our exclusive supply agreement for our raw material requirements, and our continued efforts to protect our proprietary information. We also have an additional Dermata owned family related to DMT310, with applications pending in the U.S., Australia, and Canada. This family refers to specific attributes of the DMT310 API and drug product as well as treatment related attributes for the treatment of acne based on the data received prior to its filing. Patents in this patent family, if granted, are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.

DMT410 

Our DMT410 portfolio includes two families owned by Dermata. The first family consists of one pending non-provisional U.S. patent application and six pending foreign patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, the European Patent Office, Japan, and South Korea. These patent applications relate to compositions for the treatment of skin diseases using our proprietary sponge powder in combination with multiple types of botulinum toxin for both medical and aesthetic skin conditions and diseases. Patents in this patent family, if granted, are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The second family is related to certain of our clinical methods related to sponge powder and botulinum toxin. This second family consists of a US non-provisional application and a PCT application. Patents in this patent family, if granted are expected to expire in 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 

DMT400 

Our DMT400 portfolio includes two families owned by Dermata. The first family consists of pending applications in the U.S., Canada, and Japan covering our sponge powder in combination with many approved and development stage monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of skin diseases. Patents in this patent family, if granted, are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The second family consists of a pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Japan, and South Korea, covering compositions for the treatment of conditions by dermal fillers in combination with our proprietary sponge powder. Patents in this patent family, if granted, are expected to expire in 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 

Although we believe our patent portfolio offers significant protection for DMT310, DMT410 and DMT400 and additional combination regimens, the protection offered by our patents may be, to some extent, more limited than the protection provided by patents which claim chemical structures which were previously unknown. Accordingly, other parties may compete with us, for example, by independently developing or obtaining competing topical formulations that design around our patent claims, but which may contain the same or similar active ingredients, or by seeking to invalidate our patents. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest priority date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA, requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdiction where these are available and where we also have a patent that may be eligible; however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the United State Patent and Trademark Office and United States FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.

Other Intellectual Property 

In addition to patent protection, we also rely heavily on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology innovation, technical specifications and assays and other proprietary information in attempting to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We believe our ability to protect our unpatented know-how and trade secrets are as important if not more important than our patent portfolio due the complex nature and lack of expiration associated with such information. 

We seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We currently have registrations for Dermata in the United States and multiple other jurisdictions. We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our therapeutic candidates in various jurisdictions, including the United States. 

Material Agreements 

License Agreement between Dermata Therapeutics, LLC and Villani, Inc. 

On March 31, 2017, we entered into a License Agreement (or, the License Agreement) with Villani, Inc. (or, Villani), whereby Villani has granted us an exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-bearing license (or, the License) under the Licensed Patents (as defined in the License Agreement), to formulate, develop, seek regulatory approval for, make or sell products that contain Spongilla lacustris (alone or in combination with other active or inactive ingredients) for the treatment of diseases, disorders and conditions of the skin, including but not limited to acne, rosacea, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, actinic keratosis and eczema that were developed using certain licensed know-how (or, the Licensed Products).

On July 30, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment to the License and Settlement Agreement (or, the Second License Amendment), whereby, for the settlement of certain disputes arising under the First License Amendment, we agreed to exchange the shares of Series 1c Preferred Stock owned by Villani for an increase of milestone payments and royalty rates due to Villani under the License Agreement. The resulting royalty rates payable pursuant to the Second License Amendment are equal to single-digit percentages of net sales of Licensed Products and HMW Combination Products (as defined in the License Agreement), subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Second License Amendment. Royalties are payable on a country-by-country and Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, for the period of time from the effective date of the License Agreement until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim in such country (which is set to expire in 2023), (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such Licensed Product in such country, and (iii) 15 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the Licensed Product in such country. Pursuant to the Second License Amendment, if we sublicense the License, we are obligated to pay to Villani a sublicense fee of between 10% and 30% of Sublicense Revenues (as defined in the License Agreement). Such future milestone payments due to Villani (all payable to Villani in cash or in equity, at the option of Villani) are in aggregate amounts of up to $3.5 million in development milestones and $37.0 million in sales milestones. We paid to Villani $1.0 million upon the closing of our initial public offering. 

Supply Agreement between Dermata Therapeutics LLC and Reka-Farm LLC 

On February 27, 2020, we entered into an exclusive Supply Agreement (or, the Supply Agreement) with Reka-Farm, LLC (or, Reka-Farm), whereby Reka-Farm will supply us with the Spongilla raw materials necessary for use in the development of our product candidates. The Supply Agreement has an indefinite term unless and until terminated. For the term of the Supply Agreement, Reka-Farm is prohibited from supplying Spongilla for development and sale of any other product outside of the Russian Federation, other than Cosmetic Products (as defined in the Supply Agreement).
