ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
On March 31, 2011, it was announced that our board had determined it would be in the best interest of our shareholders to transfer all of our online and operational technologies to our subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently called MariMed Inc.). The assets were transferred as of May 16, 2011 and included: Worlds’ technology platform, Worlds Ultimate Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related revenue, URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures. The Company also entered into a License Agreement with MariMed Inc. to sublicense its patented technologies, which License expired upon the expiration of the underlying patents.
 
Worlds Inc. has retained all of its related Intellectual Property (IP) consisting of the nine existing patents, 6,219,045; 7,181,690; 7,493,558; 7,945,856; 8,082,501; 8,145,998; 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 and all continuance claims currently before the USPTO including any to be filed going forward. 
 
We may also seek to acquire additional patents we believe will enhance our portfolio position in the markets within which our existing patents cover.
 
There can be no assurance that will be able to acquire additional patents.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately 1.75 million shares of MariMed Inc. common stock.
 
Before the spin-off, Worlds was a leading 3D entertainment portal which leveraged its proprietary technology, which we retained through our patent portfolio, to offer visitors a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call "worlds". These worlds are visually engaging online environments featuring animation, motion and content where people can come together and, by navigating through the website, shop, interact with others, attend events and be entertained. In support of this portal and the overall business strategy, we design and develop software, content and related technology for the creation of interactive, three-dimensional ("3D") Internet web sites. Using our technology, we created our own Internet sites, as well as sites available through third-party online service providers.
 
Sites using our technology allow numerous, simultaneous visitors to enter, navigate and share interactive "worlds". Our 3D Internet sites are designed to promote frequent, repeat and prolonged visitation by users by providing them with unique online communities featuring dynamic graphics, highly useful and entertaining information content, and interactive capabilities. We believe that sites are highly attractive to advertisers because they offer access to demographic-specific user bases comprised of people that visit the site frequently and stay for relatively long periods of time.
 
Recent developments

The Company has sought damages for patent infringement of the Company’s patents in three proceedings.  The first proceeding was filed by the Company against Activision Blizzard, Inc., Blizzard Entertainment, Inc., and Activision Publishing, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 2012.  The Company also filed a complaint for patent infringement against Linden Research, Inc., d/b/a Linden Lab in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in 2019, and filed a complaint for patent infringement against Microsoft Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in September, 2020.

1. | Company’s Lawsuit Against Activision Entities
---+----------------------------------------------

 
The Company's lawsuit against the Activision entities was filed in 2012, with U.S. District Judge Casper presiding over these proceedings.  This lawsuit was stayed in 2015 pending the outcome of six Inter Partes Review (“IPR”) petitions filed by Bungie, Inc. to the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”).  Those IPR proceedings were finally concluded in Company's favor on January 14, 2020, with each of the challenged patents and the majority of the challenged claims surviving Bungie's challenges.  Returning to its District Court litigation, the Company asked that Judge Casper lift the stay and allow the Company to proceed in its lawsuit for patent infringement of the Company’s patents against the Activision entities.
 
On April 17, 2020, Judge Casper issued an Order lifting the stay, and setting a pre-trial schedule with a final pretrial conference and trial to occur at a date to be determined after September 24, 2021.  On May 19, 2020, Activision submitted a renewed motion for summary judgment of patent invalidity under 35 U.S.C. 101, and claimed that the asserted patents are directed to patent-ineligible subject matter.  Worlds opposed this motion on June 9, 2020, and a hearing was held on July 22, 2020 at 3:00 p.m.  The parties proceeded with fact and expert discovery up to and including April 30, 2021.  On April 30, 2021, Judge Casper granted Activision’s summary judgment motion, entered an Order finding that all asserted patents were invalid as directed to patent-ineligible subject matter, and terminated the Company’s lawsuit, with judgment for the Activision Entities.  The Company appealed this Order on May 28, 2021 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting in Washington, D.C.  Oral argument occurred on March 8, 2022.  On March 10, 2022, the Federal Circuit issued an Order affirming the District Court’s judgment. 
 

2. | Company’s Lawsuit Against Linden Research, Inc. d/b/a Linden Lab
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
On September 20, 2019, the Company filed a lawsuit against Linden Research, Inc., d/b/a Linden Lab (“Linden”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for patent infringement of the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 7,181,690.  This case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika.  On December 2, 2019, Linden answered the Complaint, denying that it has committed patent infringement.  On January 8, 2020, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, setting deadlines for Fact Discovery and Contentions, Claim Construction, Expert Discovery, Summary Judgment, and Trial Phase.  A claim construction hearing (“Markman” hearing) occurred on November 13, 2020.  The scheduled trial date was set for January 31, 2022.  On April 8, 2021, the Company and Linden jointly filed a stipulation to stay the Court’s deadlines for 30 days pending completion of a settlement agreement between the parties, and the Court entered an order dismissing this lawsuit on May 17, 2021.
 

3. | Company’s Lawsuit Against Microsoft Corporation
---+------------------------------------------------

 
On September 25, 2020, the Company filed a lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas for patent infringement of the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 8,082,501.  This case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Alan D. Albright. On December 4, 2020, Microsoft filed Motion to Dismiss and Motion to Stay pending completion of an IPR filed by Microsoft against U.S. Patent No. 8,082,501 with the PTAB on December 3, 2020.  On January 15, 2021, the Court entered a Scheduling Order, setting the Jury Selection and Jury Trial for March 14, 2022.  The Company filed its Opening claim construction brief on April 9, 2021. Microsoft filed its Responsive claim construction brief on April 30, 2021.  In view of the Order issued by Judge Casper in the Company’s litigation against Activision on April 30, 2021, including the Company’s intent to appeal that Order, the Company and Microsoft jointly asked that Judge Albright stay the lawsuit against Microsoft pending the Company’s appeal of Judge Casper’s Order.  The parties’ motion to stay pending appeal was filed on May 7, 2021, and the Court granted the motion on May 11, 2021.  On June 16, 2021, the PTAB instituted Microsoft’s IPR over the Company’s objections.  On September 16, 2021, the Company and Microsoft jointly stipulated to dismiss the lawsuit, and on September 20, 2021, the Company and Microsoft jointly moved to terminate Microsoft’s IPR against U.S. Patent No. 8,082,501.  The PTAB granted the motion to terminate on September 23, 2021 and terminated the IPR.

Our Technology
 
We used our technology to produce three-dimensional portals and web sites. We believe that our core technology delivers a considerably faster frame rate for user experiences and, in some cases, a meaningful productivity increase in art production and integration over its previous generation production tools. Our technology permits the development of virtual worlds which have broad applications. These applications include but are not limited to:

• | a virtual meeting place (such as a fan club);
--+----------------------------------------------


• | a 3D e-commerce store (where merchandise can be viewed in 3D and purchased online); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a virtual classroom (where content can be viewed via video streaming and then discussed in real time).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our core technology has substantial elements written in Sun Microsystem's programming language, Java, including WorldsBrowser and WorldsShaper, so we expect that it can be made portable across Windows and UNIX Platforms because of Java's platform independence.
 
Our core technology includes:
 

• | WorldsShaper: WorldsShaper is the visual authoring component of our platform. It allows for quick assembly of pieces to create multi-user, shared state, virtual worlds. The WorldsShaper is an advanced compositing 3D building tool that integrates pre-existing or custom content, such as 3D models, textures or images created in Adobe's Photoshop, or midi or wave sound files, with architectural geometry and interactive behaviors and actions written in Java. The architectural building blocks for creating 3D worlds, the flexibility and power of integrating professional modeling and imaging tools, and the extensibility via Java make the WorldsShaper a tool well-suited for rapid creation of 3D environments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsServer: WorldsServer is the scalable software that we use to control and operate our on-line virtual communities. WorldsServer manages the registration and authentication of users, the locations of users within the 3D environment, the physical structure of the 3D environment, all information regarding objects that are "shared" by the participants and any of the interactions between the users such as text chat. This platform also integrates an HTTP server for the delivery of other content such as audio and video streaming and secure e-commerce applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsBrowser: WorldsBrowser is used to access the 3D environments. The browser is optimized for speed, delivering relatively fast frame rates per second in highly textured virtual 3D worlds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsPlayer™: The WorldsPlayer allows users to view and experience our multi-user, interactive technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with the WorldsPlayer. The WorldsPlayer has a high frame rate for fast, quality graphics, an easy-to-use graphic user interface, 2D web browser integration, automatic upgrade capability over the internet and a complete communication tool set including text chat, voice-to-voice chat, e-mail and animation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Worlds Gamma Libraries: The Worlds Gamma Libraries are composed of sample worlds, textures, models, avatars, actions, sensors, sounds, motion sequences, and other behaviors.

Our Strategy
 
Worlds Inc. will be focused on monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity virtual reality worlds and on expanding our patent portfolio and to enforce our rights where it believes parties are infringing on its IP portfolio. 
Competition
 
Since all operations were transferred to Worlds Online and our business is now the expansion of our patented technology, the Company does not have any direct competition as it did in the past. However, inasmuch as we believe that multi-user, interactive 3D is becoming a “hot” area, we expect other companies, many with far more resources than us, to move into this space.
 
Currently, there are many companies collaborating to establish standardization of 3D usage on the Internet, the adoption of which may require changes to our technology.
 
Intellectual Property
 
U.S. Patents: Worlds has been granted U.S patent 6,219,045, 7,181,690, 7,493,558, 7,945,856, 8,082,501, 8,145,998, 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 for multi-server technology for 3D applications, which is our core technology.  While the patents have all expired, we continue looking into the implications and breadth of the patent in order to maximize their benefits as well as our catalog of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity worlds.
 
Trademark: Worldsplayer - The WorldsPlayer is especially designed to allow users to view and experience the multi-user, interactive Worlds Gamma technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with WorldsPlayer.  Utilizing the WorldsPlayer, a user assumes a persona (via a digital actor, or Avatars), and can then move, view, chat, play, express one's self via gestures and animations, voice chat, send email, join discussion groups, listen to music, shop at Worlds 3D stores, and watch videos, all in the company of users from around the world, within the 3D environment.  The WorldsPlayer boasts high frame rate for fast, high quality graphics, an easy to use graphic user interface, seamless 2D Web browser integration, auto-upgrade capability over the Internet, and a complete communication tool set including chat, voice-to-voice chat, email and animation. The WorldsPlayer offers users the unique and creative experience of customizing their Avatars, while maintaining the ability to animate and activate their Avatars.   
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had one full time employee, our president and chief executive officer, Thomas Kidrin.
 
Corporate History
 
We were formed as a result of the contemporaneous mergers on December 3, 1997 of Worlds Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 26, 1994 with and into Worlds Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation formed on April 8, 1997 and of Worlds Acquisition Corp. with and into Academic Computer Systems, Inc., a New Jersey corporation formed on May 20, 1968 (the "Mergers"). Academic Computer Systems changed its name to Worlds Inc. after the Mergers. In December 1999, we changed our name from Worlds Inc. to Worlds.com Inc. in order to better reflect our business as a consumer Internet web site that offers virtual "worlds" in which consumers interact, conduct e-commerce and receive entertainment. 
 
The Company created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Worlds Online Inc. on January 25, 2011. On May 16, 2011, Worlds Inc. transferred to Worlds Online Inc. the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio. Worlds Online Inc. changed its name to MariMed Inc. in 2017.
