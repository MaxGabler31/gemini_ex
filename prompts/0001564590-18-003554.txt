Item 1.  Business.
 Eldorado Resorts, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is referred to as the “Company,” “ERI,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.”
 Overview
 We are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company owning and operating 20 gaming facilities in ten states. Our properties, which are located in Ohio, Louisiana, Nevada, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi and Missouri, feature approximately 21,000 slot machines and video lottery terminals (“VLTs”), approximately 600 table games and over 7,000 hotel rooms. Our primary source of revenue is generated by gaming operations and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties. 
 We were founded in 1973 by the Carano Family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. In 1993, we partnered with MGM Resorts International on the Silver Legacy Resort Casino, the first mega-themed resort in Reno. In 2005, we acquired our first property outside of Reno when we acquired a casino in Shreveport, Louisiana, now known as Eldorado Shreveport. In September 2014, we merged with MTR Gaming Group, Inc. (“MTR Merger”) and acquired its three gaming and racing facilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The following year, in November 2015, we acquired Circus Circus Reno and the 50% membership interest in the Silver Legacy that was owned by MGM Resorts International (the “Circus Reno/Silver Legacy Purchase” or the “Reno Acquisition”).
 On May 1, 2017, we completed our most recent – and largest - acquisition to date when we acquired Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (“Isle” or “Isle of Capri”), adding another 13 gaming properties to our portfolio (the “Isle Acquisition” or the “Isle Merger”). 
 Properties
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated approximately 950,000 square feet of casino space with approximately 21,000 slot machines and VLTs, approximately 600 table and poker games and over 7,000 hotel rooms. 
 We view each operating property as an operating unit. Prior to our acquisition of Isle, we aggregated our properties into three reportable business segments: (i) Nevada, (ii) Louisiana and (iii) Eastern. Following our acquisition of Isle, we aggregated our properties into four reportable business segments: (i) West, (ii) Midwest, (iii) South and (iv) East. For further financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years ended December 31, 2017, see Note 18, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part IV, Item 15.

West Region
 The West segment consists of five properties that are located in Nevada and Colorado. Three of the properties are located in Reno, Nevada and two are located in Black Hawk, Colorado. Reno is located at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains along Interstate 80, approximately 135 miles east of Sacramento, California and 225 miles east of San Francisco, California. Reno, along with nearby Lake Tahoe, is a destination market that attracts year-round visitation by offering gaming, numerous summer and winter recreational activities and popular special events. The Eldorado Reno, Silver Legacy and Circus Reno properties (the “Reno Tri-Properties”) are connected in a “seamless” manner by enclosed, climate controlled skywalks. We believe that the centralized location and critical mass of these three properties, together with the ease of access between the facilities, provide significant advantages over the freestanding hotel/casinos in the Reno market. Of the 31 casinos currently operating in the Reno market, we believe we compete principally with four other hotel‑casinos that each generate at least $36 million in annual gaming revenues. We also compete with Native American tribes, including casinos located in northern California, which we consider to be a significant target market. 
 Black Hawk is located approximately 40 miles east of the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area which serves as Black Hawk’s primary feeder market. Our two Black Hawk properties are connected via sky bridges. When casinos having multiple gaming licenses in the same building are combined, the Black Hawk/Central City market consists of 21 gaming facilities (five of which have more than 500 slot machines).

Business Strengths and Strategy 
 Personal service and high quality amenities
 We focus on customer satisfaction and delivering superior guest experiences. We seek to provide our customers with an extraordinary level of personal service and popular gaming, dining and entertainment experiences designed to exceed customer expectations in a clean, safe, friendly and fun environment. Our senior management is actively involved in the daily operations of our properties, frequently interacting with gaming, hotel and restaurant patrons to ensure that they are receiving the highest level of personal attention. Management believes that personal service is an integral part of fostering customer loyalty and generating repeat business. We continually monitor our casino operations to react to changing market conditions and customer demands. We target both premium-play and value-conscious gaming patrons with differentiated offerings at our state-of-the-art casinos, which feature the latest in game technology, innovative bonus options, dynamic signage, customer-convenient features and non-gaming amenities at a reasonable value and price point.
 Diversified portfolio across markets and customer segments
 We are geographically diversified across the United States, with no single property accounting for more than 12% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our customer pool draws from a diversified base of both local and out-of-town patrons. We have also initiated changes to our marketing strategy to reach more potential customers through targeted direct mailings and electronic marketing. We believe we have assembled a platform on which we can continue to grow and provide a differentiated customer experience.
 Management team with deep gaming industry experience and strong local relationships
 We have an experienced management team that includes, among others, Gary Carano, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board, who has more than thirty years of experience in the gaming and hotel industry. Mr. Carano was the driving force behind ERI’s development and operations in Nevada and Louisiana and ERI’s acquisition of Isle of Capri, MTR Gaming and Circus Reno. In addition to Gary Carano, our senior executives have significant experience in the gaming and finance industries. Our extensive management experience and unwavering commitment to our team members, guests and equity holders have been the primary drivers of our strategic goals and success. We take pride in our reinvestment in our properties and the communities we support along with emphasizing our family-style approach in an effort to build loyalty among our team members and guests. We will continue to focus on the future growth and diversification of our company while maintaining our core values and striving for operational excellence.
 Governmental Gaming Regulations
 The gaming and racing industries are highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.
 Some jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.
 Under provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable, to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.
 A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Reporting and Record‑Keeping Requirements
 We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.
 Taxation
 Gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.
Internal Revenue Service Regulations
 The Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners, for keno, bingo and slot machine winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno, bingo and slot machine winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, the other games.
 Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) and the Nevada Gaming Authorities require the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.
 Other Laws and Regulations
 Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
 The sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.
 Intellectual Property
 We use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. We have registered several service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to conduct our business. We also own patents relating to unique casino games. We file copyright applications to protect our creative artworks, which are often featured in property branding, as well as our distinctive website content.
 7


Seasonality
 Casino, hotel and racing operations in our markets are subject to seasonal variation. Seasonal weather conditions can frequently adversely affect transportation routes to each of our properties and also may cause flooding and other effects that result in closure of our Southern properties and cancellations of live horse racing at the Eastern properties. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties, including the owners or operators of real property, to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could also face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance or contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, and could be subject to significant fines or penalties for any violations. We have from time to time been responsible for investigating and remediating, or contributing to remediation costs related to, contamination located at or near certain of our facilities, including contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain of our facilities are located. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, required to manage, abate, remove or contain manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations, mold, lead, asbestos‑containing materials or other hazardous conditions found in or on our properties. Although we have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, costs related to the investigation, identification and remediation of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 12,500 employees. As of such date, we had 11 collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 970 employees. Three collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire this year. There can be no assurance that we will be able to extend or enter into replacement agreements. If we are able to extend or enter into replacement agreements, there can be no assurance as to whether the terms will be on comparable terms to the existing agreements.
