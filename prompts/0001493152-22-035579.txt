ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Parks! America, Inc., through our wholly owned subsidiaries, owns and operates three regional theme parks and is in the business of acquiring, developing and operating local and regional theme parks and attractions in the United States. Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Wild Animal Safari, Inc., a Georgia corporation (“Wild Animal – Georgia”), Wild Animal, Inc., a Missouri corporation (“Wild Animal – Missouri”), and Aggieland-Parks, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas”). Wild Animal – Georgia owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park in Pine Mountain, Georgia (the “Georgia Park”). Wild Animal – Missouri owns and operates the Wild Animal Safari theme park located in Strafford, Missouri (the “Missouri Park”). Aggieland Wild Animal – Texas owns and operates the Aggieland Wild Animal Safari theme park near Bryan/College Station, Texas (the “Texas Park”). We acquired our Georgia Park on June 13, 2005, our Missouri Park on March 5, 2008, and our Texas Park on April 27, 2020.
 
Our parks are open year round, but experience increased seasonal attendance, typically beginning in the latter half of March through early September. Combined third and fourth quarter net sales were 62.1% and 60.3% of annual attendance based net sales for our 2022 and 2021 fiscal years, respectively. Since the acquisition of our Texas Park, the combined third and fourth quarter concentration of our sales has been reduced.
 
Our business plan includes expansion via the acquisition of additional local or regional theme parks and attractions. We believe acquisitions, if any, should not unnecessarily encumber the Company with additional debt that cannot be justified by current operations. We may also pursue contract management opportunities for themed attractions owned by third parties. By using a combination of equity, debt and other financing options, we intend to carefully monitor stockholder value in conjunction with the pursuit of growth.
 
Shares of our common stock trade on the OTC Markets Group OTCPink marketplace (“OTCPink”) under the symbol, “PRKA.”

On December 19, 2003, Royal Pacific Resources, Inc. acquired the assets of Great Western Parks LLC pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement that set the stage for our current corporate structure and operating strategy. We changed the name of the Company to Great American Family Parks, Inc.

Animal Park Operations
 
Park revenues are primarily derived from admission fees, food and beverage sales, gift shop and specialty item sales, and sales of animal food. During our 2022 fiscal year, we introduced private and semi-private animal keeper guided animal encounters at each of our parks. We also introduced vehicle rentals at our Missouri and Texas Parks, which have been a customer favorite at our Georgia Park for over a decade. Management’s plans to grow revenues at each of our parks include ongoing improvements to existing facilities, making each park more attractive to visitors and developing unused acreage. We also believe that increasing local and regional awareness of each park via advertising and promotion is a critical element of our revenue growth plans, especially for our Texas and Missouri Parks.
 
In addition to the animal environments, each of our parks contain a gift shop, a restaurant or concessions areas, and picnic areas. We sell food and beverages in our restaurants or concession areas, and a variety of items in our gift shops, including shirts, hats, educational books, toys and novelty items, many of which are animal themed. Our 2023 fiscal year plans include the continuing renovation of walk about animal habitats and enclosures, especially at our Georgia Park, completion of a new otter exhibit at our Missouri Park, and the completion of expanded food service capabilities and offerings at our Texas Park. Our plan to open a significant new giraffe exhibit at our Georgia Park during our 2022 fiscal year experienced delays due to a highly inflationary period for building materials and a challenging labor market. We remain committed to this showcase attraction and expect to make progress on this project during our 2023 fiscal year, however the opening date is still unknown. Increasing attendance, as well as increasing the per capita income generated in our gift shops and from concessions, continues to be a primary focus.
 
Most of the animals at each of our parks have been born on-site or domestically acquired. We rarely import animals and have not imported any animals in the past 10 years. Auctions and sales of animals across the United States occur often and we may acquire animals in these auctions if we see an opportunity to enhance the animal population at our parks. As a result of natural breeding, animal populations at our Parks tend to grow over time. Periodically, we sell surplus animals, and the proceeds are recorded as revenue. The periodic acquisition and sale of animals is also part of our herd and genetic management program. From time-to-time, we may also relocate animals between our parks as part of this program. Each park is subject to routine inspection by federal and state agencies. Each park maintains a high standard of animal care and has passed all recent inspections.
 
Employees
 
Our Georgia Park has approximately 25 full-time employees and engages a range of 20-35 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Missouri Park has approximately 12 full-time employees and engages in the range of 10-20 additional part-time and seasonal employees. Our Texas Park has approximately 14 full-time employees and engages in the range of 10-20 additional part-time and seasonal employees. We also engage consultants from time to time. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and believe our relations with our employees are good. Parks! America has three officers and one manager who oversee the strategy of the Company, the operations and capital investment activities of our Parks, as well as the overall financial activities, controls and reporting for the Company and each Park.
