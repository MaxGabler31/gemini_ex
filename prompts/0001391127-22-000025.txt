Item 1.        Business 
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003 and have operated in the Phoenix metropolitan area since 2001 and elsewhere throughout the United States since 2003. We began international operations in 2004. Our principal executive office is located at 2220 W. 14th Street, Tempe, Arizona, 85281, and our main telephone number is (602) 850-5000. We operate and report on a calendar year basis with our fiscal quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31st.
Overview 
Limelight’s goal is to provide clients with a productive, performant and protected environment to run their mission critical applications on the edge.
Limelight has a comprehensive strategic operating plan focused on evolving the company into a leading provider of edge services for outcome buyers by offering solutions that we believe provide superior performance and team productivity versus point solutions available from existing vendors. Limelight is targeting this $37 billion market with its two edge solutions: Content Delivery and AppOps.
The foundation of our strategy is supported by three pillars, each of which balance our immediate and longer-term growth and profitability objectives. The first pillar is improving our core, which focuses on network performance and operating costs; the second pillar is expanding our core, which focuses on revenue growth with existing and new clients, and the third pillar is extending our core, which focuses on introducing new solutions that will increase network utilization, growth, and gross margins.
Based on our Improve-Extend-Expand pillars, in 2021, we implemented a rigorous and disciplined process that spans all aspects of our network and client operations. This has resulted in significant sequential growth and margin expansion since implementation.
In September 2021, we announced the acquisition of Moov Corporation (Moov), a California corporation doing business as Layer0, a sub-scale SaaS based application acceleration and developer support platform. We believe this platform coupled with our global CDN network will be a catalyst in our pursuit of positioning us as an Edge Solutions platform. Our acquisition of Moov was a significant step in advancing Limelight's strategy as an edge-enabled software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions provider with the combined platform delivering sub-second web applications (Apps) and application programming interfaces (APIs) through an all-in-one Jamstack platform. This flagship product enables Limelight to capitalize on the accelerating trend of developers using the edge to better address application performance, improve overall productivity, and reduce the attack surface. We believe that the combined Moov capabilities and our proprietary global network give Limelight the best application delivery solution in the market.
Industry Trends 
The internet of the future requires the highest quality digital experiences around the world. Four major trends include:
Faster Web Apps. Consumer expectations for online experiences have never been higher. A website’s user experience needs to be fast, seamless, and uninterrupted. According to Google, 53% of visitors will abandon a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load. This puts pressure on developers to release web Apps that load at sub-second speeds. We believe having a fully integrated platform with developer workflow will be a growing requirement for businesses worldwide.
Faster Web App Teams. Teams that ship software faster, grow revenue faster. The fastest quartile of teams work at companies who grow revenue 2.5 to 5 times faster than companies with slower teams, according to a (May 2021) study by McKinsey. We believe our holistic platform allows teams to ship updates to their Apps significantly faster than today’s state-of-the-art, which requires cobbling together over a dozen point cloud services from the hyperscale cloud, web CDN, and observability vendors. 
Broadcast-Quality Online Video and rise of OTT. We believe online video and the practice of "cord cutting" is now a primary choice for people to watch video content, whether it’s via their personal computers, smartphones, tablets, smart televisions, or other connected devices. Consumers expect the same quality experience online as they would have in viewing broadcast television. This puts a significant burden on publishers to not only produce compelling content, but also to deliver it in a way that meets high consumer expectations. We believe that as more content is made available in 4K resolution, more consumers will want to consume the higher-quality content, resulting in increased strain on internet architecture and infrastructure.
Growth of Digital Downloads. We believe consumers are increasingly making purchases of movies, music, video games, and applications digitally from a variety of retailers and download sizes have increased, especially for video games. For example, releases of popular games have topped 70 gigabytes in size. As digital purchases of massive files increase further, we believe this will cause more strain on the internet’s infrastructure. We believe this will result in additional pressure on organizations and service providers to take steps to avoid congestion, latency, lengthening download times, and increasingly interrupted downloads, all of which we believe would undermine an organization’s ability to deliver the best possible digital experience.
Our Services 
Our services leverage Limelight’s high capacity, high speed private global network with distributed computing resources and extensive connectivity to last-mile broadband network providers, ideal for emerging edge compute workloads where rapid response times are needed.
Layer0 by Limelight (aka AppOps). Limelight’s extensive global network provides the infrastructure backbone trusted by large video providers. Layer0 by Limelight takes this to the next level for web applications, integrating the edge into the web developer’s environment while offering next-generation features that allows teams to ship twice as fast and the ability to deliver sub-second page loads. Layer0 by Limelight can augment or replace a site’s existing web content delivery network (CDN) and security vendor to deliver faster page loads and lower costs while the development team gains new features that cater to the shift to zero ops and programming at the edge.
Content Delivery. Global broadcasters and content rights owners trust Limelight for delivery of their big launches and high-profile live streaming events. From fast file downloads to instant loading web pages, Limelight’s ongoing investment in the development and optimization of every component of its CDN provides exceptional performance, even over congested or changing network conditions.
Video Delivery. Limelight’s live and on-demand video delivery services and online video platform integrate Limelight's global private network with advanced video delivery and management capabilities, helping clients get over-the-top video to virtually any device, anywhere in the world at high quality and with the lowest rebuffer rates in the industry.
Cloud Security. Limelight’s cloud security services offer a layered defense against malicious website attacks and unauthorized content access without impacting the performance of web applications and content delivery. Limelight DDoS Attack Interceptor defends against denial-of-service attacks, and Limelight Web Application Firewall protection guards against attacks that are intended to compromise the back-end services of applications and web sites, in order to deface, disable, or steal data. 
Limelight Global Network 
Limelight’s network has helped launch and grow many large video properties in the world and is now on the forefront of enabling a new generation of web and application development with Layer0. 
Website builders now have a dramatically simpler yet more capable infrastructure in the cloud for their websites and APIs. As the hyper scale cloud providers and the existing edge platform vendors keep offering point ‘cloud primitives’ as ‘hammers and nails,’ Limelight is delivering what clients have been asking for — an integrated solution that securely delivers outstanding productivity and performance outcomes in the market:
Our private fiber backbone enables traffic to bypass the congested public internet, resulting in faster, more reliable, and more secure content delivery. Our infrastructure is densely architected with data centers clustered around major metropolitan locations and directly interconnected with thousands of major internet service providers (ISPs) and last-mile networks. Limelight provides an exceptional user experience in a more secure infrastructure with the capacity to support the most onerous digital traffic demands:
•110 terabits per second
•More than 140 global Points-of Presence (PoPs)
•More than 1,000 ISP connections
•More than 50 countries served
•Sub-second page loads
Unlike traditional CDN vendors which rely on third-party technologies for key components of their content delivery infrastructure, Limelight’s ongoing investment in the development and optimization of every component of our content delivery platform provides outstanding delivery performance with a fully-integrated suite of software services that solve clients’ content and application delivery challenges.
Sales, Service, and Marketing 
We target media, high tech, software, gaming, enterprise, and other organizations for which the delivery of digital content and Apps are critical to the success of their business. 
Our sales, services, and marketing professionals are based in locations across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, and they focus on direct and channel sales, sales operations, professional services, account management, and technical consulting. We have been investing in growing our sales team, which has resulted in significant growth in sales pipeline and backlog.  As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 115 employees in sales positions. To support sales, service teams and architects are also available to help clients respond to changing business requirements, implement new services, facilitate training, or augment staff. 
We conduct marketing programs to support sales efforts and promote the Limelight brand. We invest in a variety of targeted digital and non-digital marketing activities and programs to build awareness, engage with prospective clients, and build pipelines for our global sales teams. As of December 31, 2021, we had 7 employees on our global marketing team.
Clients 
Our clients operate in the media, entertainment, gaming, technology and software, enterprise, retail, and other sectors. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 580 active clients worldwide, including many notable brands in the world in the fields of online video, live sports, digital music, news media, games, rich media applications, e-commerce, financial services, travel, and software delivery. 
As we provide exceptional network performance and cost efficiency, we believe there continues to be significant opportunity to expand market share with our current clients. We believe we have an opportunity to continue driving improvements in profitability and growth by extending the use of our network to new clients with new solutions that use non-peak traffic solutions. 
Both new and existing clients are focused on creating better digital experiences for their customers, and their digital builders need to load content faster, personalize it more, and protect it outside of the control environment. Our clients are seeking to augment the scale and centralization benefits the cloud offers with a low latency, real-time processing, and security-enabled edge network. Our goal as an organization is to continue to put powerful differentiated edge capabilities in the hands of all of our clients.
Competition 
Content Delivery 
We operate in the digital content delivery market, which is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. We expect this competitive environment to continue. 
The principal methods of competition in this market include scale, performance, service, ease of use, product features, and price. We primarily face competition from Akamai, Lumen Technologies, Amazon, Fastly, StackPath, and Verizon Digital Media Services.
Product feature competition is intense, requiring continuous investment in innovation. 
We believe our future success will depend on our ability to continue to innovate and enhance the performance, integration, and functionality of our existing suite of services and of our global network, and on our ability to add additional services and functionality to meet the market’s increasing expectations regarding digital content delivery.
We believe our established edge services platform is the broadest offering available. Our cloud-based software and flexible serverless computing combined with our high-speed private global network infrastructure, solves multiple challenges for clients by removing the need to install, manage, or provision software and hardware to satisfy the requirements for storing and delivering digital content. In addition, the market for digital content delivery can sometimes require multiple vendors to provide clients with a complete set of tools and services to manage and deliver all of their digital content to all audiences as part of a global digital presence. We also believe that in those situations where multiple vendors are required, Limelight offers one of the few CDNs with the scale, performance, and reach required to deliver digital content to global audiences.
Web App CDN and AppOps 
Developers want the ability to access the edge of a global network to create their front-end applications, preview their content, and deploy instantly. They also need to deliver their applications on a platform that includes basic security needs such 
as web application firewall (WAF), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), and threat detection. 
By combining the SaaS assets of Layer0 with the existing global edge platform of Limelight, our app delivery solution drives significant value for clients including better performance with website speeds four times faster than current competitive alternatives, improved developer productivity with our Jamstack tool set, simple-to-deploy web Apps built for the edge, and self-service onboarding.
While our competition focuses on static site generation as a means to accelerate websites and empower developers, Limelight focuses on dynamic site caching at the edge. Layer0 brings the full site speeds and frontend developer productivity benefits of Jamstack to large-scale, dynamic websites that have thousands or even millions of pages and frequently changing data. Layer0 makes these websites faster for end-users and easier for development teams to manage.
Research and Development 
Our research and development (R&D) organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of the software, hardware, and network architecture of our global network, as well as support of our content delivery and AppOps solutions. As of December 31, 2021, we had 161 employees and employee equivalents in our research and development group.
Our engineering efforts support product development across all of our service areas, as well as innovation related to the global network itself. We test our services to ensure scalability in times of peak demand. We use internally developed and third-party software to monitor and to improve the performance of our network in the major internet consumer markets around the world.
The acquisition of Layer0 added significant technical talent to Limelight’s R&D organization, with more than 90 new team members joining. They will be instrumental in carrying out our vision of enabling our solution sets within our global edge network for developers and for overseeing Limelight’s evolution as an edge solutions platform. 
Our research and development expenses were $21,669, $21,680, and $22,534 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, including stock-based compensation expense of $2,435, $2,589, and $1,922 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and other intellectual capital. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain registrations, and contractual protections.
As of December 31, 2021, we had received 132 patents in the United States, expiring between 2023 and 2036, and we had 3 U.S. patent application pending. We do not have any issued patents in foreign countries. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any patents that may be issued to us may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. Therefore, we cannot predict the exact effect of having a patent with certainty.
As of December 31, 2021, we had received three trademarks in the United States. Our name, Limelight Networks, Inc., has been filed for multiple classes in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union (including Benelux) India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. We have 24 non-United States trademarks registered. There is a risk that pending trademark applications may not issue, and that those trademarks that have issued may be challenged by others who believe they have superior rights to the marks.
We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including physical and electronic security, contractual protections with employees, contractors, clients and partners, and domestic and foreign copyright laws.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 552 employees and employee equivalents, a decrease of 66 from 618 on December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in workforce of approximately 16% in March of 2021. Our employees are represented by approximately 13 self-identified nationalities working in approximately 18 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak approximately 14 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, primarily experienced in the technology sector with approximately 80% of our employees working in R&D, Operations, Growth and Client Success. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our voluntary turnover rate normalized to approximately 1% monthly, below the technology industry benchmark (Culpepper, January 2022).
