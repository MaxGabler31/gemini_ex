Item 1. | BUSINESS
---------+---------

General 
 Hub Group, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on March 8, 1995. We are one of North America’s leading asset-light freight transportation management companies. We offer comprehensive intermodal, truck brokerage and logistics services. Since our founding in 1971, we have grown to become one of the largest intermodal marketing companies (“IMC”) in the United States and one of the largest truck brokers. Through our network, we have the ability to arrange for the movement of freight in and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We utilize an asset-light strategy in order to minimize our investment in equipment and facilities and reduce our capital requirements. We arrange freight movement for our customers through transportation carriers and equipment providers. 
 In April 2011, we acquired all of the capital stock of Exel Transportation Services, Inc. (“ETS”). ETS is now our wholly-owned subsidiary, operating independently and renamed Mode Transportation, LLC (“Mode LLC”). Mode LLC has approximately 182 agents, consisting of 102 IBOs, who sell services and operate the business throughout North America and 80 sales only agents. Mode also has a temperature protected services division operated out of our Oak Brook, IL headquarters and corporate offices in Memphis, TN and Dallas, TX. 
 We report two distinct business segments. The first segment is “Mode,” which includes the acquired Mode LLC business only. Mode LLC markets and operates its freight transportation services primarily through its network of IBOs who enter into contracts with Mode LLC. The second segment is “Hub,” which is all business other than Mode. Hub operates through a network of operating centers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Hub services a large and diversified customer base in a broad range of industries, including consumer products, retail and durable goods. Both segments offer intermodal, truck brokerage and logistics services. “Hub Group” includes both segments. 
 Services Provided
Our transportation services for both the Hub and the Mode segments can be broadly placed into the following categories: 
 Intermodal. As an IMC, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers and trailers, typically over long distances of 750 miles or more. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies, known as “drayage companies,” for pickup and delivery. As part of our intermodal services, we negotiate rail and drayage rates, electronically track shipments in transit, consolidate billing and handle claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of our customers. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned a total of 29,378 53-foot private containers and we had exclusive access to approximately 2,581 rail-owned containers for our dedicated use on the Union Pacific (“UP”) and the Norfolk Southern (“NS”) rails. We use our network to access containers and trailers owned by leasing companies, railroads and steamship lines. We are able to track trailers and containers entering a service area and reuse that equipment to fulfill the customers’ outbound shipping requirements. This effectively allows us to “capture” containers and trailers that we do not own or have exclusive access to and keep them within our network. 
 During 2016, our subsidiary, Hub Group Trucking, Inc. (“Hub Group Trucking”) accounted for approximately 56% of Hub’s drayage needs by assisting us in providing reliable, cost effective intermodal services to our customers. As of December 31, 2016 Hub Group Trucking had terminals in Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Chattanooga, Chicago, Columbus (OH), Dallas, Harrisburg, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Memphis, Nashville, Newark, Philadelphia, Portland (OR), Salt Lake City, Savannah, Seattle, St. Louis, Stockton and Wilmington (IL) metro areas. As of December 31, 2016, Hub Group Trucking leased or owned 984 tractors and 436 trailers, employed 971 drivers and contracted with 1,721 owner-operators.

Truck Brokerage (Highway Services). We are one of the largest truck brokers in the United States, providing customers with another option for their transportation needs. We match the customers’ needs with carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective service and price combination. We have contracts with a substantial base of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. As part of the truck brokerage services, we negotiate rates, track shipments in transit and handle claims for freight loss and damage on behalf of our customers. 
 Logistics and Other Services. Hub’s logistics business operates under the name of Unyson Logistics. Unyson Logistics is comprised of a network of logistics professionals dedicated to developing, implementing and operating customized logistics solutions. Unyson Logistics offers a wide range of transportation management services and technology solutions including shipment optimization, load consolidation, mode selection, carrier management, load planning and execution and web-based shipment visibility. Unyson Logistics operates throughout North America, providing operations through its main operating location in St. Louis with additional support locations in the Boston, Chicago, Cleveland and Minneapolis metro areas. Certain Mode LLC agents provide logistics services. Our multi-modal transportation capabilities through both the Hub and Mode segments include small parcel, heavyweight, expedited, less-than-truckload, truckload, intermodal and railcar. 
 Hub and Mode LLC Networks
 Hub’s entire network is interactively connected through Hub’s proprietary Network Management System and Mode LLC’s network is connected through its third party transportation management system. This enables us to arrange for the movement of freight into and out of every major city in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
 In a typical intermodal transaction, the customer contacts one of Hub’s intermodal operating centers or a Mode LLC IBO to place an order. The operating center/IBO determines the price, obtains the necessary intermodal equipment, arranges for it to be delivered to the customer by a drayage company and, after the freight is loaded, arranges for the transportation of the container or trailer to the rail ramp. Relevant information is entered into our system by the assigned operating center/IBO. Our predictive track and trace technology then monitors the shipment to ensure that it arrives as scheduled and alerts the customer service personnel if there are service delays. The operating center/IBO then arranges for and confirms delivery by a drayage company at the destination. After unloading, the empty equipment is made available for reloading by the operating center/IBO for the delivery market. 
 We provide truck brokerage services to our customers in a similar manner. In a typical truck brokerage transaction, the customer contacts one of Hub’s highway operating centers or a Mode LLC IBO to obtain a price quote for a particular freight movement. The customer then provides appropriate shipping information to the operating center/IBO. The operating center/IBO makes the delivery appointment and arranges with the appropriate carrier to pick up the freight. Once it receives confirmation that the freight has been picked up, the operating center/IBO monitors the movement of the freight until it reaches its destination and the delivery has been confirmed. If the carrier notifies us that after delivering the load it will need additional freight, we may notify other operating centers/IBOs. Although under no obligation to do so, those operating centers/IBOs may then attempt to secure additional freight for the carrier. 
 Marketing and Customers 
 As one of the world’s leading transportation management companies, Hub Group is committed to providing multi-modal solutions throughout North America, including intermodal, truck brokerage and logistics services.  We have transformed our organization from a traditional Intermodal Marketing Company (IMC) into a multi-modal solutions provider. This change has revolutionized our offerings and the way we service our customers.  We look at our customers’ entire networks to provide innovative multi-modal solutions to drive savings, improve service and offer full visibility.
After 45 years in business, we continue to live by the simple mantra that "good" isn't good enough. To ensure we grow and improve, we focus intently on our customers, listening to their needs, developing comprehensive transportation solutions and delivering superior service. We invest in our people and technology to maintain our competitive edge in order to be the best transportation partner for our customers.
 We face a continued need to help our customers meet consumer demands of having products and services through any buying channel. With efficiency as our guide, we have been delivering to an already leaner supply chain, with our customers reporting an increase in speed and improved visibility. We accomplish this by investing in people, technology and equipment. Our satellite tracking equipment ensures our customers have the capacity needed; state-of-the-art technology helps to maintain our high levels of service while providing 24/7 visibility into any shipment; and our people have the skills, training and information to quickly respond to our customers' changing supply chain network. Supporting every customer is a dedicated team of professionals ready to service any and all of our customers' needs. We call this our "One Hub" experience.

The majority of our business is in the retail, consumer products, durable goods and automotive verticals.  No one customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in 2016 in either reporting segment.
 The Mode LLC acquisition diversified Hub Group’s customer base with more small and medium sized customers, as Hub has traditionally focused, to a significant degree, on larger national accounts.  Mode IBOs and sales agents are often able to devote more attention to smaller and medium sized shippers and develop long-term relationships with them. 
 Management Information Systems 
 
Our technology strategy continues to prioritize our investment into solutions that deliver value to our customers while also providing advanced capabilities to our operations teams, our drivers and our 3rd party carriers.  In 2016, we moved our API based design forward allowing for the real time delivery of position information providing customers with crucial data to predict service outcomes.  In addition, we introduced our first mobile app for 3rd party carriers.  We will continue to advance both areas in 2017 with new mobile apps planned for delivery as well as continuing to mature our API offerings.  In addition, our customers will also be able to experience new capabilities and engagement options through our customer portal.  We remain laser focused on executing our cloud based approach to solutions as it is critical to dramatically changing the rate and pace at which we can deliver new and innovative solutions while lowering the total cost.  
      Unyson is known in the industry for managing and solving complex transportation networks with sophisticated solutions using world class processes and technology.  Unyson’s sophisticated solution includes creative and skilled utilization of Oracle Transportation Management (OTM). In addition, strategic investments have been made in building out an Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure that we are able to report and provide visibility to drive continuous improvement.  Unyson’s customers benefit from advanced solutions that include multi-leg order optimization, SKU level shipment management, iterative consolidation, cross customer collaboration and flexible invoicing options.  Our investments are yielding returns as we continue to onboard customers with complex supply chains that our previous TMS could not support.  We will continue to leverage our approach to bring on new customers as well as continue to transition current customers to OTM to meet our retirement goals for legacy products.  
      In 2017, we will begin the implementation of OTM for Intermodal and Truck Brokerage.  The powerful OTM solution will bring complete visibility across all of our services allowing us to provide robust solutions to complex customer needs.  In addition, through optimized planning decisions and efficiency in daily operations we will see measurable value once we have reached full rollout.  Finally, the solution allows us to scale to meet the needs of our large and complex customer base.  While we will begin the work surrounding the implementation in 2017, the rollout will take place in 2018 and complete in 2019.  We will leverage industry expertise as well as our close relationship to the OTM development team to increase the probability of success and reduce the risk that comes with transformation.
 Mode LLC utilizes a dynamic transportation management platform that integrates best in class third party technologies to manage its business.  This platform includes an execution system that provides multi-modal solutions, visibility to status of shipments, facilitation of customer billing, and a robust portal that allows exchange of information about loads, capacity, and event status information between transportation providers and our end customers.  Additionally Mode LLC’s platform consists of components that allow for optimization of our customer’s order process, management of our diverse carrier base, and robust analytics and business intelligence solutions that allow our customers to better understand outcomes and opportunities within their supply chain.  Throughout our platform we leverage flexible integrations to provide connectivity between our technology components along with available touch points across our thousands of trading partners ranging from customers to major rail carriers to numerous trucking partners.  This provides a robust and scalable technological solution that can meet the needs of a growing transportation network.
 Relationship with Railroads 
 A key element of our business strategy is to strengthen our close working relationships with the major intermodal railroads in the United States. Due to our size and relative importance, some railroads have dedicated support personnel to focus on our day-to-day service requirements. On a regular basis, our senior executives and each of the railroads meet to discuss major strategic issues concerning intermodal transportation. 
 We have relationships with each of the following major railroads: 
 
 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe | Florida East Coast 
-----------------------------+---------------------
Canadian National | Kansas City Southern
Canadian Pacific | Norfolk Southern 
CSX | Union Pacific 
Ferromex |

We also have relationships with each of the following major service providers: APL, CMA CGM (America) Inc., COSCO (China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company), Domestic Intermodal America, Evergreen Shipping Agency (America) Corp., Express System Intermodal Inc., Florens Container Services, Hamburg Sud Group, Hanjin Shipping, Hapag-Lloyd (America) Inc., Hyundai Merchant Marine, K-Line America, M+R Forwarding (HK) Limited, Maersk Sea-Land, Mediterranean Shipping Company, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (America) Inc., NYK (Nippon Usen Kaisha) Line, OOCL (Orient Overseas Container Line), Triton Overseas Transport, Westwood Shipping Lines, Yang Ming (America) Corp., and Zim Integrated Shipping Services. 
 Transportation rates are market driven. We sometimes negotiate with the railroads or other major service providers on a route or customer specific basis. Consistent with industry practice, some of the rates we negotiate are special commodity quotations (“SCQs”), which provide discounts from published price lists based on competitive market factors and are designed by the railroads or major service providers to attract new business or to retain existing business. SCQ rates are generally issued for the account of a single IMC. SCQ rates apply to specific customers in specified shipping lanes for a specific period of time, usually up to 12 months. 
Relationship with Drayage Companies 
 Hub has a “Quality Drayage Program,” under which participants commit to provide high quality drayage service along with clean and safe equipment, maintain a defined on-time performance level and follow specified procedures designed to minimize freight loss and damage. We negotiate drayage rates for transportation between specific origin and destination points. 
 We also provide drayage services with our own drayage operations, which we operate through our subsidiary Hub Group Trucking. Our drayage operations employ their own drivers and also contract with owner-operators who supply their own trucks. 
 Relationship with Trucking Companies 
 Our truck brokerage operation has a large number of active trucking companies that we use to transport freight. The Hub operating centers and Mode IBOs deal daily with these carriers on an operational level. Our corporate headquarters handles the administrative and regulatory aspects of the trucking company relationship. Our relationships with these trucking companies are important since these relationships determine pricing, load coverage and overall service. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
 We require all drayage companies participating in Hub’s Quality Drayage Program to carry at least $1.0 million in general liability insurance, $1.0 million in truckman’s auto liability insurance and a minimum of $100,000 in cargo insurance. Railroads, which are self-insured, provide limited cargo protection, generally up to $250,000 per shipment. To cover freight loss or damage when a carrier’s liability cannot be established or a carrier’s insurance is insufficient to cover the claim, we carry our own cargo insurance with a limit of $1.0 million per container or trailer and a limit of $20.0 million in the aggregate. We also carry general liability insurance with limits of $5.0 million per occurrence with a companion $50.0 million umbrella policy on this general liability insurance.
We maintain separate insurance policies to cover potential exposure from our company-owned drayage operations. We carry commercial general liability insurance with a limit of $5.0 million per occurrence, subject to a $10.0 million policy aggregate limit, and trucker’s automobile liability insurance with a limit of $5.0 million per occurrence. Additionally, we have an umbrella excess liability policy with a limit of $45.0 million. We also maintain motor truck cargo liability insurance with a limit of $1.0 million per occurrence.
 Government Regulation 
 The company and various subsidiaries, including Mode LLC, are licensed by the Department of Transportation as brokers in arranging for the transportation of general commodities by motor vehicle. To the extent that the Hub operating centers and Mode LLC IBOs perform truck brokerage services, they do so under these licenses. The Department of Transportation prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including a $75,000 surety bond that we have posted. In addition, Hub and Mode each have customs bonds. To date, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, the transportation industry is subject to legislative or regulatory changes that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services.

Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
 We achieved Custom-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) certification in 2013 and validation in 2014. C-TPAT is a voluntary supply chain security program led by U.S. Customs and Border Protection focused on improving the security of private companies’ supply chains with respect to terrorism. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risks throughout their international supply chain. This certification allows us to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of our customers’ cargo, including fewer customs examinations. 
Competition 
 The transportation services industry is highly competitive. We compete against other IMCs, as well as logistics companies, third party brokers, trucking companies and railroads that market their own intermodal services. Several larger trucking companies have entered into agreements with railroads to market intermodal services nationwide. Competition is based primarily on freight rates, quality of service, reliability, transit time and scope of operations. Several transportation service companies and trucking companies, and all of the major railroads, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. 
General 
 Employees: As of December 31, 2016, Hub Group had 2,755 employees consisting of 2,628 Hub employees, or 1,657 employees excluding drivers, and 127 Mode LLC employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. 
 As of December 31, 2016, Mode LLC had 102 IBOs and 80 sales only agents. Nearly all of the sales-only agents and IBOs are under written contracts with Mode LLC. 
 Other: No material portion of our operations is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government. Our business is seasonal to the extent that certain customer groups, such as retail, are seasonal.
