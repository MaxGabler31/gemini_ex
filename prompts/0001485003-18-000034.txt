Overview
We are a biologics oncology company focused primarily on designing, engineering and developing targeted protein therapeutics, or TPTs. Our TPTs are single protein therapeutics composed of targeting moieties genetically fused via a peptide linker domain to cytotoxic protein payloads that are produced through our proprietary recombinant one-step manufacturing process. We target tumor cell surface antigens that allow for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell and also have limited expression on normal cells. We have designed our TPTs to overcome the fundamental efficacy and safety challenges inherent in existing antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, where a payload is chemically attached to a targeting antibody.
Our most advanced product candidate is ViciniumTM, which is a locally-administered TPT. In a completed Phase 2 clinical trial, of the 45 evaluable subjects treated with Vicinium, 40% achieved a complete response or no evidence of disease at three months while 16% remained disease-free for at least 18 months. In the third quarter of 2015, we, through our subsidiary, Viventia Bio Inc., or Viventia, commenced in the United States and Canada a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium for the treatment of subjects with high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC. We completed enrollment in this clinical trial in March 2018 and anticipate reporting topline three-month data in mid-2018 and topline twelve-month data in the second quarter of 2019. In June 2017, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, for the development of Vicinium in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, for the treatment of NMIBC. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in subjects with high-grade NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicinium in combination with durvalumab. This Phase 1 trial is open and actively recruiting subjects. 
Our second most advanced product candidate is ProxiniumTM, a locally-administered TPT intended for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN. In our two Phase 1 clinical trials, 53% of evaluable subjects treated with Proxinium demonstrated antitumor activity with epithelial cell adhesion molecule, or EpCAM-expressing tumors as assessed by the investigators' clinical measurements, the investigators’ overall assessment including qualitative changes, and assessment of available radiologic data. In addition, three out of the four subjects with complete responses of injected tumors had regression or complete resolution of adjacent non injected lesions. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, we observed tumor shrinkage in 10 of the 14 evaluable subjects (71.4%). We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that will explore the potential of Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of SCCHN and are actively seeking partners for a combination program. In addition to our locally-administered TPTs, our pipeline also includes systemically-administered TPTs in development. Our systemically-administered TPTs are built around our proprietary de-immunized variant of the plant-derived cytotoxin bouganin, or deBouganin. Our lead systemically-administered product candidate, VB6-845d, is being developed for the treatment of multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. VB6-845d is administered by intravenous infusion. A Phase 1 clinical trial conducted with VB6-845, the prior version of VB6-845d, revealed no clinically relevant immune response to the deBouganin payload. We plan on submitting an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with VB6-845d, once funding or a partner is secured for this program.
We have deferred further development of Proxinium and VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium. We are also exploring collaborations for Vicinium, Proxinium and VB6-845d.
We maintain global development, marketing and commercialization rights for all of our TPT-based product candidates. We intend to explore various commercialization strategies to market our approved products. If we obtain regulatory approval for Vicinium in high-grade NMIBC, we may build a North American specialty urology sales force to market the product or seek commercialization partners. If we obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates, including Proxinium, we may seek partners with oncology expertise in order to maximize the commercial value of each asset or a portfolio of assets. We also own or exclusively license worldwide intellectual property rights for all of our TPT-based product candidates, covering our key patents with protection ranging from 2018 to 2036. See ‘‘Business-Intellectual Property’’ for additional details.
On June 10, 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we licensed our monoclonal antibody EBI-031 and all other IL-6 antagonist antibody technology owned by us. Under the License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing EBI-031 at its cost. At the time of the License Agreement, EBI-031, which was derived using our previous AMP-Rx platform, was in pre-clinical development as an intravitreal injection for diabetic macular edema and uveitis. We have received $30.0 million in payments from Roche pursuant to the License Agreement, including a $7.5 million upfront payment and a $22.5 million milestone payment as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective. We are also entitled to receive up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of other specified regulatory, development

and commercial milestones, as well as royalties based on net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 or any other potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds.
We also previously invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidate isunakinra (EBI-005) for the treatment of subjects with dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis. Based on negative results from our completed Phase 3 clinical trials in 2015 and 2016 for the treatment of dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis, we do not plan to pursue further development of isunakinra.
Our TPT Platform
Our current product candidates are based on our proprietary TPT platform and are focused on addressing areas of unmet medical need in cancer. Our novel TPTs have been designed to overcome the efficacy and safety challenges of existing ADCs and are being developed for both local and systemic administration. Our TPTs are single protein therapeutics composed of targeting moieties genetically fused via linker domains to cytotoxic protein payloads that are produced through our proprietary recombinant one-step manufacturing process. Our TPT platform uses protein binding antibody fragments, which include fragment antigen binding domains, or Fabs, single chain variable domains, or scFvs, and non-covalent scFv dimers, or diabodies, derived from the domains of antibodies that confer antigen recognition. We select antibody fragments for our product candidates depending upon the target therapeutic indication. We target tumor cell surface antigens that allow for rapid internalization into the targeted cancer cell and that also have limited expression in normal cells. For local administrations, we utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload designed to both target cancer cells and promote a heightened local immune response against the tumor. For systemic administrations, we use a deBouganin payload that we believe can be repeatedly administered via infusion without the generation of an efficacy-limiting immune response against the payload.
Locally-administered TPTs
We utilize our TPTs with immunogenic cytotoxic protein payloads for tumors that can be targeted locally rather than systemically. Local administration allows for the TPT to reach the tumor without being cleared by the immune system, which enables us to maximize the concentration of TPTs directly to tumors. Our locally-administered TPTs, including Vicinium, our lead product candidate, and Proxinium, contain a targeting moiety that is designed to bind to EpCAM, which is a protein over-expressed in many cancers. This targeting moiety is genetically fused to a truncated form of exotoxin A, or ETA, which is an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is produced by the bacterial species, Pseudomonas. These product candidates are designed to bind to EpCAM on the surface of cancer cells. The TPT-EpCAM complex is subsequently internalized into the cell, and, once inside the cell, the TPT is cleaved by a cellular enzyme to release the cytotoxic protein payload, thus enabling cancer cell-killing.
We also believe that our TPTs designed for local administration may not only directly kill cancer cells through a targeted delivery of a cytotoxic protein payload, but also potentiate an anti-cancer therapeutic immune response in cancer cells near the site of administration. This immune response is believed to be triggered by both the immunogenic cell death of the cancer cells due to our payload's mechanism of action and the subsequent release of tumor antigens and the immunologically active setting created by the nature of the cytotoxic protein payloads. We believe that this immune response may also enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors, which require a pre-existing immune response for maximum efficacy.
Our most advanced locally-administered product candidates are Vicinium and Proxinium, for the treatment of high-grade NMIBC and recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN, respectively. These TPTs are not, however, suitable for systemic administration over multiple doses because the body’s immune system would recognize and eliminate foreign proteins, such as ETA, prior to their reaching targeted cancer cells.
Systemically-administered TPTs
We also utilize our TPTs with a de-immunized payload where systemic administration is required. Our systemically-administered TPTs currently in development are built around deBouganin. Since the body’s immune system naturally recognizes and attempts to eliminate foreign proteins, we designed our systemically administered TPTs with a deBouganin payload to avoid inducing an immunogenic response. DeBouganin is constructed by mutating the immunogenic T-cell epitopes from bouganin so that they are not recognized as foreign by the immune system. However, we also believe that deBouganin may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors as a result of the promotion of a local tumor immune response following the death of cancer cells. Our systemically-administered product candidate is VB6-845d for the treatment of multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors.
Our Differentiated Approach to Targeted Therapies

Table of Contents

We believe that our TPT construct will address many challenges experienced with existing ADCs. The basic construct for our TPTs and existing ADCs is similar as each is comprised of a targeting moiety that specifically binds to cancer cells and delivers a cytotoxic payload. However, existing ADCs have been associated with limitations that we believe are addressed by our TPTs.
Limitations of existing ADC approaches to treating tumors 
We believe existing ADCs have the following fundamental efficacy and safety challenges:

• | Deliver insufficient drug to tumors. Existing ADCs utilize full-length antibodies, which, due to their large size, have a reduced ability to penetrate tumors, thereby reducing their efficacy.


• | Inability to kill a broad array of cancer cells within a tumor. Subsets of cancer cells within tumors may have mechanisms to resist and not be responsive to the cytotoxic payloads, or small molecule chemotherapies, used in existing ADCs.


• | Off-target toxicities due to unstable chemical linkage between targeting antibody and cytotoxic payload. Existing ADCs utilize chemical linkage strategies to join antibodies to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. While in the circulatory system, these chemical linkages can break and release free cytotoxic payloads in the circulation. These free small molecule cytotoxic payloads are not targeted and cannot discriminate between dividing cancer cells and non-cancerous cells, thus resulting in increased off-target toxicities.


• | Limited combination therapy potential. The release of free cytotoxic payloads in the tumor region can result in toxicity to immune cells that attack tumors. This effect on anti-tumor immune cells may limit the potential utility of existing ADCs in combination therapies, including those employing immune checkpoint inhibitors.


• | Complex and challenging manufacturing process. The multi-step manufacturing process of existing ADCs creates a non-homogeneous product that limits efficacy and drives greater costs than our manufacturing process.

Advantages of our TPT platform
We believe our TPTs offer the following key advantages:

• | Deliver a greater amount of drug to tumors. Our TPTs are designed using smaller targeting proteins that have an increased ability to exit the circulatory system and have binding properties designed to enable deeper penetration into targeted tumors, and we believe this will increase efficacy.


• | Ability to kill a broader array of cancer cells within a tumor. Our novel cytotoxic payloads consist of proteins rather than small molecule cytotoxic payloads. We believe the larger size of our cytotoxic protein payloads helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms that can make certain cancer cells resistant to small molecule cytotoxic payloads. By contrast to existing ADCs, which employ cytotoxic payloads that inhibit cellular replication and are effective at killing rapidly proliferating cancer cells, our cytotoxic protein payloads inhibit protein synthesis and are designed to kill not only rapidly proliferating, but also slowly growing cancer cells including tumor progenitor cells/cancer stem-like cells.


• | Increase safety due to a more stable linkage between targeting protein and cytotoxic payload. Our single protein molecules are designed to remain intact until they reach the inside of the cancer cell and to not release free cytotoxins into the circulatory system, thereby minimizing off-target toxicity.


• | Promote a therapeutic immune response. We believe that the potent TPT toxin-mediated killing of cancer cells in this immunologically active setting leads to the efficient presentation of cancer antigens to the immune system, thereby promoting an anti-tumor cellular immune response. Our locally-administered TPTs utilize an immunogenic cytotoxic payload that we believe promotes a heightened immune response in the local tumor environment.


• | Potential combination with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that the potential effect of checkpoint inhibitors, which are antibodies that promote the action of anti-tumor T-cells by blocking inhibitory ligand/receptor interactions that include PD-1 and PD-L1, may be enhanced when used in combination with other agents. We believe that, by mediating specific killing of tumor cells and promoting anti-tumor immune responses, our TPTs, while potentially effective on their own, may complement checkpoint inhibitors. In particular, we believe that our use of our cytotoxin payload ETA, which promotes an immune response in the local tumor environment, may facilitate the presentation of tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells, thereby providing a tumor immune response to enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

• | Utilize a simpler and more efficient manufacturing process. Our proprietary recombinant one-step manufacturing process creates a homogeneous product that we believe will improve efficacy and result in lower manufacturing costs.

Our Strategy
We are committed to designing, engineering, developing and commercializing TPTs to identify and address oncology indications that suffer from a high unmet medical need. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Rapidly advance Vicinium through clinical development and obtain regulatory approval. Based upon our September 2014 end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, in the third quarter of 2015, we, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium in subjects with high-grade NMIBC in the United States and Canada. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm studies. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm studies. We believe that our Phase 3 clinical trial design is consistent with these aspects of the FDA’s guidance. We completed enrollment of this Phase 3 clinical trial in March 2018 and anticipate reporting topline three-month data in mid-2018 and topline twelve-month data in the second quarter of 2019. If this Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, we intend to pursue regulatory approval initially in the United States and Canada. Assuming that we receive positive data in our Phase 3 clinical trial, we intend to initiate discussions with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, regarding a regulatory pathway for European Union, or E.U., approval.


• | Explore opportunities in combination therapies. We plan to continue discussions with potential partners that utilize technologies whose mechanism of action could be complementary to our TPT platform. These technologies include, but are not limited to, checkpoint inhibitors, immune modulators and other immuno-oncology agents. In June 2017, we entered into a CRADA with the NCI for the development of Vicinium in combination with AstraZeneca’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, for the treatment of NMIBC. Under the terms of the CRADA, the NCI will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in subjects with high-grade NMIBC to evaluate the safety, efficacy and biological correlates of Vicinium in combination with durvalumab. This Phase 1 trial is open and actively recruiting subjects.


• | Advance Proxinium through clinical development and obtain regulatory approval. We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that will explore the potential of Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. We anticipate that the Phase 1/2a clinical trial will explore the potential for Proxinium, due to its potential immunogenic effect, to enhance checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapy for the treatment of EpCAM-expressing SCCHN.


• | Advance our systemically-administered product candidate, VB6-845d. In April 2016, we submitted an IND to the FDA in preparation of initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB6-845d in subjects with EpCAM-positive cancers in the United States. The IND was withdrawn in July 2016 after we received initial feedback from the FDA indicating that they had identified hold and non-hold deficiencies that needed to be addressed. In December 2016, we submitted a request for a pre-IND meeting to seek input on the manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical plans for VB6-845d prior to resubmitting an IND. In February 2017, the FDA provided guidance on our manufacturing and nonclinical plans for VB6-845d. Based on this guidance, we are performing additional studies to support an updated IND submission. We believe that the deBouganin payload in VB6-845d may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors as a result of the promotion of a local tumor immune response following the death of cancer cells.


• | Expand on the value of selected product candidates through strategic partnerships. We may decide to selectively partner with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies when we believe that a partner could bring additional resources and expertise to maximize the value of one or more of our product candidates.


• | Leverage our TPT platform to develop additional product candidates. We intend to develop additional product candidates based on our TPT platform. Depending on the strategic and financial merits, we may enter into partnerships and collaborations to support these development efforts.


• | Maximize the commercial value of our product candidates. We maintain global development, marketing and commercialization rights for all of our TPT-based product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for Vicinium in high-grade NMIBC, we may build a North American specialty urology sales force to market the product in the United States and Canada or seek commercialization partners. Outside the United States and Canada, we will seek commercialization partners with urology expertise. If we obtain regulatory approval for

our other product candidates, including Proxinium, we may seek partners with oncology expertise in order to maximize the commercial value of each asset or a portfolio of assets.
We have deferred further development of Proxinium and VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium.
Our License Agreement with Roche
On June 10, 2016, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche. Under the License Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize, at its cost, our monoclonal antibody EBI-031 and all other IL-6 antagonist antibody technology owned by us. Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Roche is required to continue developing EBI-031 and any other product made from the other transferred IL-6 antagonist antibody technology at its cost.
Roche paid an upfront license fee of $7.5 million and a $22.5 million milestone payment as a result of the IND application for EBI-031 becoming effective. Roche has also agreed to pay up to an additional $240.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory, development and commercial milestones. In addition, we are entitled to receive royalty payments in accordance with a tiered royalty rate scale, with rates ranging from 7.5% to 15% for net sales of potential future products containing EBI-031 and up to 50% of these rates for net sales of potential future products containing other IL-6 compounds, with each of the royalties subject to reduction under certain circumstances and to the buy-out options of Roche.
Our Product Pipeline
At this time we are focused exclusively on the clinical development of Vicinium and have deferred further development of our other product candidates. The following table sets forth our current development stage programs:

Vicinium
Overview
Our most advanced locally-administered product candidate, Vicinium, is being developed for the treatment of high-grade NMIBC in subjects who have previously received two courses of BCG and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive. Vicinium is administered by intravesical administration directly into the bladder. Vicinium utilizes an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is a truncated form of ETA produced by the bacterial species, Pseudomonas. Vicinium also includes an anti-EpCAM ScFv targeting moiety that is required to deliver the ETA into EpCAM-expressing cancer cells. The toxicity to non-cancerous bladder cells is minimized due to their not having EpCAM over-expressed on their surface.
In a completed Phase 2 clinical trial, of the 45 evaluable subjects, 40% achieved a complete response, or CR, or no evidence of disease at three months while 16% remained disease-free for at least 18 months. Median time to disease recurrence was 274 days for subjects achieving a CR following a six-week induction phase, and this was extended to 408 days for subjects achieving a CR following a longer 12-week induction phase. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two dosing strategies (p=0.17). Vicinium was generally well-tolerated with no subjects discontinuing treatment in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials due to adverse events.
Based upon our September 2014 end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium in subjects with high-grade NMIBC who have received two courses of BCG, and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the current standard of care is the surgical removal of their bladder, or a radical cystectomy, in the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Canada. Based on safety and efficacy data observed with the longer 12-week induction in our Phase 2 clinical trial, the FDA agreed to our plan to employ more frequent dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial, in which the primary end points are CR and duration of response, or DoR, in subjects with carcinoma in situ, or CIS, whose disease is BCG-unresponsive. In November 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new drugs and biologics for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, including the use of single-arm studies. The FDA finalized this guidance in February 2018 and retained many of the recommendations from the 2016 draft guidance regarding clinical trial design, including the use of single-arm studies. We completed enrollment in this clinical trial in March 2018 and anticipate reporting topline three-month data in mid-2018 and topline twelve-month data in the second quarter of 2019. If this Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, we intend to initially pursue regulatory approval in the United States and Canada.
As part of this trial, in July 2015, we submitted a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, to Health Canada to include Canadian sites. In September 2015, we received a No Objection Letter from Health Canada, permitting us to proceed with our Phase 3 clinical trial in Canada. Assuming that we receive positive data in our Phase 3 clinical trial, we intend to initiate discussions with the EMA regarding a regulatory pathway for E.U. approval.
Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development of Vicinium to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in subjects with high-grade NMIBC. Because Vicinium contains ETA, an immunogenic cytotoxic payload that elicits an anti-ETA immune response, we believe the local administration of Vicinium may amplify the local host immune response within the tumor environment killing bladder cancer cells through an Immunogenic Cell Death, or ICD, mechanism. In addition, we believe that this ICD response, which potentiates host immune responses against neoantigens present on the cancer cells, can lead to a heightened host immune response against their own tumor and potentially complement checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our Vicinium intellectual property portfolio that provides unextended patent term until 2024, and, if our pending patent applications for Vicinium are granted patent protection until at least 2036. See ‘‘Business-Intellectual Property’’ for additional details.
Disease overview
Most cancers that form in the bladder are transitional cell carcinomas that derive from the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder can be characterized as either high-grade or low-grade. Low-grade bladder cancer often recurs in the lining of the bladder after treatment, but rarely invades the muscular wall of the bladder or spreads to other parts of the body and is unlikely to be fatal. High-grade bladder cancer commonly recurs in the bladder, has a strong tendency to invade the muscular wall of the bladder, spreads to other parts of the body and is much more likely to result in death. Bladder cancer is also divided into muscle-invasive and NMIBC, based on invasion of the muscularis propria, which is the thick muscle deep in the bladder wall. Muscle invasive disease is more likely to spread to other parts of the body.

Table of Contents

There are three forms of high-grade NMIBC, which are Ta, a papillary tumor in the innermost layer of the bladder lining, T1, a papillary tumor that has started to grow into the connective tissue beneath the bladder lining, and CIS, flat lesions of the transitional cell lining of the bladder. Papillary tumors are generally low-grade with low risk of progression, although about two to nine percent are high-grade, with a moderately high risk of progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. CIS tumors are always high-grade, with a worse prognosis than papillary tumors. CIS tumors appear irregular and abnormal under a microscope and the tumors are more aggressive, with a high probability of progression to muscle-invasive disease. Furthermore, the incidence of CIS in conjunction with Ta or T1 tumors results in a higher risk of recurrence and progression. About 75% to 85% of bladder cancers are non-muscle invasive. Of these, Ta tumors account for about 57% to 70%, CIS accounts for about 5% to 13% and T1 tumors account for about 20% to 30%.
Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and the second most common malignancy of the genitourinary system. There were an estimated 430,000 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed in 2012 and 165,000 deaths worldwide. The global prevalence of bladder cancer is estimated at 2.7 million individuals. The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 79,000 new cases of bladder cancer would be diagnosed in 2017 and there would be approximately 16,870 deaths due to bladder cancer in the United States during 2017. Based on a 2010 estimate prepared using Medicare data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, among cancers in the United States, bladder cancer has the highest per-patient treatment costs, with an estimated overall cost of $3.9 billion annually. In the United States, bladder cancer has the highest overall cost among the elderly. Based on our assessment of the market, the treatment paradigm has remained the same since those figures were generated and we believe the cost of care has increased. 
NMIBC makes up 75% to 85% of all bladder cancers. The high recurrence rate and ongoing invasive monitoring requirement of bladder cancers are the key contributors to the economic and human toll of this disease. Bladder cancer occurs predominantly in older patients (about nine of the 10 people with bladder cancer are over the age of 55 years). The median age at diagnosis is approximately 73 years. Overall, the five year survival rate for bladder cancer in the United States is 77%. While the five year survival rates are 98% for stage zero and 88% for stage one NMIBC, once the cancer becomes invasive, the rates drop dramatically with five year survival rates of 63%, 46% and 15% for stage two, three and four muscle invasive bladder cancers, respectively. We are targeting subjects with BCG-unresponsive high-grade NMIBC. Our initial target market includes the approximately 25,000 patients diagnosed annually, as well as the patients who have previously failed BCG and have refused cystectomy. We would expect that, if Vicinium is approved by the FDA, patients would receive treatment until the earlier of 2 years and disease recurrence.
Current approaches to treatment
Within high-grade NMIBC, the initial treatment of Ta or T1 is transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, or TURBT, followed by BCG treatment. For CIS, whether or not TURBT is an option, BCG is the standard of care. BCG is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, with a diminished virulence in humans. Since BCG works by utilizing an immune/inflammatory mechanism, BCG is generally initiated only two to four weeks after TURBT, allowing the urothelium to heal and lowering the risk of systemic infection. When high-grade bladder tumors have been completely resected, BCG is used as adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. In patients with residual disease after resection, BCG helps to eradicate residual disease and delay progression. The BCG regimen consists of an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase. The induction phase involves six consecutive once-weekly instillations of the drug into the bladder. The maintenance phase involves three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three to six months for at least one year. The response rate to a single induction phase of BCG is 60% to 70% with an additional 30% to 50% of the non-responders becoming responders following a second induction phase. However, BCG’s failure rate for all responders is estimated to be as high as 50% within the first 12 months of treatment and 90% within five years. 
For patients who received BCG, and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, radical cystectomy is recommended due to the risk of progression to muscle invasive disease, which greatly reduces a patient’s prognosis. Radical cystectomy is a complex surgery associated with a significant morbidity rate of 28% to 45% and a mortality rate of 8% within six months of surgery. The surgery also entails a number of short-term risks including bleeding and/or clots, infections, bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, peritonitis and injury to the urethra. More than 25% of radical cystectomy patients require readmission for surgery-related complications within 90 days following surgery, and 34% require emergency room visits. The impact of radical cystectomy is life-altering, with major lifestyle changes, including incontinence and sexual dysfunction, and daily issues related to management of the external bag for urine collection.
In 2009, Valstar was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in patients for whom radical cystectomy is not an option. Valstar is administered intravesically directly into the bladder once a week for six weeks. Due to drug resistance and toxicities, Valstar has had limited utility. Other than Valstar, there are no other approved therapies for CIS bladder cancer. However, there are various other product candidates in development for the

treatment of NMIBC, including product candidates developed by AADi, LLC (ABI-009), Altor BioScience Corp. (ALT-801), Cold Genesys, Inc. (CG0070) and FKD Therapies Oy (Instiladrin). 
Clinical trials and pre-clinical studies
Pre-clinical studies. Our in vitro studies of Vicinium in bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated activity following an exposure time equivalent to clinical dosing. The anti-tumor activity of Vicinium was also evaluated against human tumor xenografts (SCCHN, colorectal and small cell lung carcinoma cell lines) using an athymic mouse model. Mice bearing EpCAM-positive human tumor xenografts implanted subcutaneously were administered 0.25-0.5 mg/kg of Vicinium by intravenous injection, and tumor size monitored over the course of the pre-clinical study (33 to 51 days post-initiation of treatment) and compared to that of an untreated tumor-bearing group. Vicinium demonstrated significant tumor growth suppression. Vicinium is designed to be a local therapy and is administered by intravesical instillation directly to the bladder. Vicinium repeatedly administered subcutaneously in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys did not result in any product candidate-related systemic toxicity. Toxicities associated with subcutaneous administration were limited to localized irritation with skin lesions resolving by the end of the pre-clinical study. Vicinium was found to be immunogenic in all species tested with anti-drug antibodies observed after seven days of dosing.
Phase 1 clinical trial. We initiated an open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of Vicinium in September 2004 at 22 sites in Canada. We enrolled 64 subjects with high-grade Ta or T1 tumors with or without CIS (17 of which had CIS) and who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. The Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, and the recommended Phase 2 dose. The secondary objective was to explore the anti-tumor activity of Vicinium. 
Eight dose levels were initially evaluated, ranging from 0.1 to 10.56 mg dose given once weekly for six consecutive weeks. Each dose was administered by instillation and held for two hours prior to voiding. Safety data from each dose cohort was evaluated after three weeks of treatment before proceeding to the next dose cohort. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached; therefore, additional escalations through 13.73 mg, 17.85 mg, 23.20 mg and 30.16 mg were undertaken. No dose-limiting toxicities, or DLTs, were reported and no maximum tolerated dose was reached in these additional dose-escalations. Vicinium was generally well-tolerated at each of these escalated doses. 
A CR was defined in this Phase 1 clinical trial as non-positive urinary cytology and either normal cystoscopy or abnormal cystoscopy with negative biopsy. Of the 64 subjects enrolled, only 61 were considered to be evaluable for efficacy as two subjects were excluded from the analysis due to an absence of BCG treatment prior to this Phase 1 clinical trial, and there was one unrelated death for whom no final tumor assessment was obtained. Evidence of clinical efficacy, as defined by a CR, was achieved by 24 of the 61 randomized subjects (39%). Only three of the 17 subjects (18%) treated in the 0.1-<1mg/dose range were CRs. In contrast, seven of the 14 subjects (50%) treated in 1.0-<10mg/dose range and 14 of the 30 subjects (46.7%) treated in the ≥10mg/dose range experienced CRs at the three month assessment. Of the subjects with CIS, five of the 17 subjects (29%) achieved a CR, while non-recurrence was observed in seven of the 16 subjects with T1 (43.8%) and 12 of the 28 subjects with Ta (42.8%). This Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in April 2006.
Phase 2 clinical trial. Based on our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Canada, we submitted the IND for Vicinium to the FDA in August 2005, and we initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Vicinium in March 2007 at 20 sites, in Canada and the United States. We enrolled 46 subjects with CIS (with or without Ta or T1) who had previously received at least one treatment of BCG. Of the 46 subjects enrolled, 27 subjects (58.7%) had received at least two treatments of BCG. The Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to determine the tolerability and explore the potential for clinical benefit from Vicinium. Clinical benefit was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as a CR or no evidence of disease at the three month evaluation. A CR was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as no histological evidence of disease and negative urine cytology. Any cases with no histological evidence of disease on initial biopsy but atypical or suspicious urine cytology were also considered CRs only if they remained negative after being evaluated with repeat biopsy, directed and random. Vicinium showed evidence of clinical efficacy. A subject was considered to have a durable CR if that subject obtained a CR and remained disease-free for a period of at least 12 months from initiation of treatment. 
The dosing regimen for our Phase 2 clinical trial included an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase, consisting of three weekly treatments and then nine weeks of no treatment repeated every three months for at least one year and ending with nine weeks of no treatment. There were two treatment groups in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Treatment Arm A consisted of 23 subjects, of which 22 were ultimately evaluable as one subject violated eligibility requirements early in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Twenty-two subjects in the induction phase received six consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg of Vicinium. At the three-month assessment, subjects with residual disease but no disease progression-where disease progression

is defined as being muscle invasive-were eligible for either a second induction phase or a maintenance phase, which consisted of three consecutive once-weekly instillations repeated every three months for at least one year. Of the 13 subjects unable to achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, nine subjects elected additional treatment. From these nine, two became CRs after receiving maintenance dosing. Treatment Arm B was added to evaluate a longer induction cycle. In Treatment Arm B, 23 subjects in the induction phase received 12 consecutive once-weekly instillations of 30 mg Vicinium. At the three-month assessment, the CR rate for both treatment arms was 40%. At the 12-month assessment, the CR rate in Treatment Arm A was 13%, but 17% in Treatment Arm B. Of those subjects who did not achieve a CR at the three-month assessment, 73% had either a reduction in tumor size or did not experience further tumor growth.
The following charts demonstrate the responses in this Phase 2 clinical trial in Treatment Arm A and Treatment Arm B. The data below shows the percentage change in surface area of cancer within the bladder, based on bladder mapping data utilizing cystoscopy in 40 subjects.

This Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in September 2009.
Near the completion of this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2009, Valstar was re-launched in the United States for the treatment of BCG-refractory CIS bladder cancer in subjects for whom immediate cystectomy would be associated with unacceptable morbidity or mortality. However, because physicians were not widely prescribing Valstar to their patients and it was not an approved therapy in Europe, this disrupted our originally designed clinical path of a head-to-head pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium against Valstar. Due to the uncertainty of the standard of care in this space, our efforts were put on hold until a clear clinical path was established. In May 2013, the FDA co-sponsored a public workshop where it evaluated potential trial designs for the development of therapies for NMIBC and specifically provided regulatory guidance supporting the idea that a single-arm clinical trial could provide sufficient evidence of benefit if the results were robust. The panel suggested it is acceptable to include high-grade papillary subjects without CIS in a clinical trial with CIS subjects because the clinical management and outcome if left untreated is considered to be the same. Thereafter, we began discussions with the FDA and refocused our resources to commence an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium in subjects with high-grade NMIBC.
Safety data. We believe that our safety data from 110 subjects in our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials support further development of Vicinium. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigators to be related to Vicinium. There was one Grade 5 serious adverse event, or death, which was determined by the clinical investigator to be unrelated to Vicinium. The most common treatment-related adverse events were an abnormally frequent passage of small amounts of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination, the majority of which were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. No subjects discontinued treatment due to a Vicinium-related adverse event during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
Vicinium Phase 3 clinical trial development plan
Based upon our September 2014 end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we, through our subsidiary Viventia, commenced an open-label, non-randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Vicinium in subjects with high-grade NMIBC who have received two courses of BCG, and whose disease is now BCG-unresponsive, and for whom the current standard of care is the surgical removal of their bladder, or a radical cystectomy, in the third quarter of 2015 in the United States and Canada. Based

on safety and efficacy data observed with the longer 12-week induction in our Phase 2 clinical trial, the FDA agreed to our plan to employ more frequent dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial, in which the primary end points are CR and DoR in subjects with CIS whose disease is BCG-unresponsive. In November 2016, the FDA provided draft guidance regarding appropriate clinical trial design for new therapies for NMIBC, including the use of single-arm studies, and we believe that our Phase 3 clinical trial design is consistent with the FDA’s draft guidance. We completed enrollment in this clinical trial in March 2018 and anticipate reporting three-month topline data in mid-2018 and topline twelve-month data in the second quarter of 2019. If this Phase 3 clinical trial is successful, we intend to initially pursue regulatory approval in the United States and Canada.
As part of this trial, in July 2015, we submitted a Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, to Health Canada to include Canadian sites. In September 2015, we received a No Objection Letter from Health Canada, permitting us to proceed with our Phase 3 clinical trial in Canada. Assuming that we receive positive data in our Phase 3 clinical trial, we intend to initiate discussions with the EMA regarding a regulatory pathway for E.U. approval.
Our Phase 3 clinical trial protocol is as follows: 

Dose | 30 mg of Vicinium (in 50 mL of saline) 
Estimated total enrollment | Approximately 134 subjects, including 77 CIS subjects whose disease is refractory to or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment
Primary endpoint | • | Complete response rate in subjects with CIS (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is refractory or relapsed in six months or less following adequate BCG treatment, which is defined as at least two courses of full dose BCG; and 
 | • | DoR will be estimated (Kaplan-Meier Estimate) for those subjects with CIS whose disease is refractory to or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment (with or without papillary disease) who experience a complete response.

Subjects with CIS will be considered to have a complete response if at the time of any disease status evaluation (per protocol every 13 weeks or any unscheduled evaluation) there is no evidence of high-grade disease (CIS, high-grade Ta or high-grade T1 disease) or disease progression (e.g., to muscle invasive disease). Low-grade disease is not considered a treatment failure in these subjects and they may remain on study treatment following TURBT.

Secondary endpoints | • | Complete response rate and DoR in subjects with CIS whose disease is refractory to or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment (with or without papillary disease) whose disease is refractory or relapsed from six months to 11 months following adequate BCG treatment;
 | • | Complete response rate and DoR in all subjects with CIS (with or without papillary disease) following adequate BCG treatment; 
 | • | Event-free survival, or EFS, in all subjects; 
 | • | Complete response rate in subjects at three, six, nine, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months in subjects with CIS whose disease is refractory to or relapsed within 6 months of the last dose of adequate BCG treatment; 
 | • | Time to cystectomy in all subjects; 
 | • | Time to disease recurrence in all subjects; 
 | • | Progression-free survival, or PFS, in all subjects; 
 | • | Overall survival, or OS, in all subjects; and 
 | • | Safety and tolerability of Vicinium therapy in all subjects. 
Exploratory endpoint | To evaluate biomarkers that may be associated with response or disease progression or treatment failure, which may include, for example, EpCAM status, tumor subtype morphology, furin levels in tumor cell endosomes, presence of a glycosaminoglycan coat, and presence of receptors that could impede a host anti-tumor immune response such as PD-L1.

Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development of Vicinium to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in subjects with high-grade NMIBC.

Proxinium
Overview
Our second most advanced locally-administered product candidate, Proxinium, is being developed as a treatment for subjects with recurrent or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN who have received at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN. Proxinium utilizes an immunogenic cytotoxic protein payload that is a truncated form of ETA produced by the bacterial, Pseudomonas, and is designed to target EpCAM-positive cancer cells, while minimizing toxicity to non-cancerous cells. Proxinium is administered via injection directly into the targeted tumor, or intratumoral injection. Proxinium has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA and Fast Track designation from the FDA.
In our two Phase 1 clinical trials, subjects treated with Proxinium had demonstrated antiitumor activity in 53% of evaluable subjects with EpCAM-expressing tumors as assessed by the investigators’ clinical measurements, the investigators' overall assessment including qualitative changes, and assessment of available radiologic data. In addition, three out of the four subjects with complete responses of injected tumors had regression or complete resolution of adjacent non injected lesions. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, we observed tumor shrinkage in 10 of the 14 evaluable subjects (71.4%). Combined results from two Phase 1 clinical trials encompassing 44 subjects have shown complete resolution or reduction in size of injected tumors in 16 of the 30 evaluable EpCAM-positive subjects (53.3%). An additional 27% of evaluable subjects had stable disease and, therefore, the results indicate an overall tumor control rate of approximately 80%. Proxinium was generally well-tolerated during the clinical trials. Dose-limiting toxicity in the Phase 1 clinical trials was transaminase elevation in liver enzymes.
In our clinical trials involving Proxinium, we have also observed some stabilization, partial reduction and complete resolution of non-injected tumors. We believe that TPT mediated killing of cancer cells occurs via a mechanism known as ICD, which is known to enhance the presentation of neoantigens to the immune system. We believe that this, combined with the immunogenic nature of our cytotoxic protein payload creates a heightened immune response, wherein naive cytotoxic T cells are stimulated by antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, presenting tumor cell surface antigens following the death of cancer cells. We believe that this anti-tumor response may complement checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that will explore the potential of Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of SCCHN and are actively seeking partners for a combination program. We anticipate that the Phase 1/2a clinical trial will explore the potential for Proxinium, due to its potential immunogenic effect, to enhance checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapy for the treatment of SCCHN. We will be measuring both the objective response rates and immune response biomarkers in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial. Should a trial yield encouraging results and we are able to secure additional funding, we will move into later stage trials.
During a Type C meeting with FDA in 2007, the FDA noted that approval of a companion diagnostic for EpCAM expression would need to coincide with Proxinium approval. During the clinical evaluation of Proxinium, we developed an immunohistochemical test to determine whether clinical trial subjects are EpCAM-positive. Internal examination from head and neck cancer subjects showed that our EpCAM antibody bound to 84% of all subject samples. We intend to seek the FDA’s input as to whether this immunohistochemical test satisfies the FDA’s request for a companion diagnostic for EpCAM expression and whether we will need to submit this test for pre-market approval as a companion diagnostic in conjunction with Proxinium.
Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development of Proxinium to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in subjects with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic EpCAM-expressing SCCHN.
We believe the local administration of Proxinium mediates ICD of cancer cells leading to the release of tumor-specific neoantigens and attracting/activating cells of the host immune system. Further, Proxinium, like Vicinium, contains ETA, an immunogenic cytotoxic payload. The local activation of an anti-ETA response may further heighten the local immune response. We also believe that the effect of checkpoint inhibitors may be enhanced if they are used in combination with Proxinium due to its potential immunogenic effect.
We have deferred further development of Proxinium in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium. We are also exploring collaborations for Proxinium.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our Proxinium intellectual property portfolio that provide unextended patent term until 2024 and, if our pending composition of matter patent applications for Proxinium are granted, until at least 2036. See ‘‘Business-Intellectual Property’’ for additional details.

Disease overview
Head and neck cancers, which include cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx, are collectively the sixth most common cancers in the world. Head and neck cancer develops from the mucosal linings of the upper aerodigestive tract, comprising of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the nasopharynx, the hypopharynx, larynx, and trachea, and the oral cavity and oropharynx. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent malignant tumor of the head and neck region. Invasive head and neck cancers arise in most cases from preneoplastic lesions grouped under the term dysplasia. Dysplastic lesions present with an increased likelihood of progressing to squamous cell carcinoma. The altered epithelium displays architectural and cytological changes that range from mild to severe.
There are approximately 650,000 new cases annually and nearly 350,000 deaths due to head and neck cancer. In head and neck cancer, approximately 40% to 60% of deaths result from local or regional disease. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 64,690 new cases of head and neck cancers in the United States in 2018, of which 51,540 cases would be attributed to cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and 13,150 cases would be attributed to cancer of the larynx, and 13,740 deaths. Most of head and neck cancers are biologically similar with more than 90% being squamous cell carcinomas that commonly originate in the epithelium. They are strongly associated, more so than other cancers, with certain environmental and lifestyle risk factors, and worldwide incidence exceeds 650,000 cases annually.
New treatment modalities have been undermined by the approximately 10% to 25% of cured patients who subsequently develop second primary tumors due to field cancerization. These second primary tumors are one of the leading factors in the 40% to 50% five year survival rate. Based on our immunohistochemical test used during our clinical trials of Proxinium, we believe that approximately 84% of late-stage SCCHN are EpCAM-positive. We are initially developing Proxinium to potentially address late-stage SCCHN. We would expect that, if Proxinium is approved by the FDA, patients would receive treatment until disease progression.
Current approaches to treatment 
Existing treatment options for SCCHN include immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors), surgery, drug therapies, radiation therapy or a combination of therapies. There is no standard treatment option for patients who progress after receiving these treatments. Approximately 60% of patients with head and neck cancer have locally recurrent disease and distant metastases occur in 20% to 30% of patients.
Currently, Erbitux, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, is the only FDA approved tumor-targeted therapy for the treatment of late-stage SCCHN. Erbitux has been approved as a first-line therapy for late-stage SCCHN in combination with platinum-based therapy plus fluorouracil. Erbitux has also attained approval as a monotherapy or in combination with radiation therapy for second-line treatment of late-stage SCCHN in patients that have failed platinum-based therapy.
The five year survival rate for patients with locally recurrent disease is reported to be 40% to 50% and loco-regional recurrence is the predominant cause of failure and up to 70% of such patients have advanced disease. In addition, more than 50% of all patients who die from head and neck cancers have loco-regional disease as the only site of failure. If head and neck cancers are not controlled locally, they can infringe on the esophagus and airway, compromising nutrition and respiratory functions and often resulting in significant anatomic disfigurement. As such, the management of locally recurrent disease requires a multidisciplinary approach involving an array of specialists with an expertise in head and neck cancers. 
Most recently checkpoint inhibitors have entered into use in the treatment of SCCHN. Two checkpoint inhibitors that target PD-1, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have now received approval for the treatment of SCCHN. Nivolumab was granted FDA approval for the treatment of patients with SCCHN who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab-treated subjects had a 30% reduction in the risk of death; a median OS of 7.5 months for nivolumab and 5.1 months for investigator's choice, or IC. There were no statistically significant differences between the two arms for progression-free survival or objective response rate, or ORR (13.3% versus 5.8% for nivolumab and IC, respectively). Pembrolizumab was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCCHN who have progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST version 1.1, as assessed by blinded independent central review, and duration of response. The ORR was 16% (95% CI: 11, 22) with a complete response rate of 5%.

Clinical trials and pre-clinical studies
Pre-clinical studies. Pre-clinical data from in vitro and in vivo studies of Proxinium have demonstrated the potential to be safe in humans and to have clinical activity. In vitro pharmacology studies have demonstrated that Proxinium exhibits potent cytotoxicity against numerous EpCAM-positive cell lines, including SCCHN, bladder tumor and prostate tumor cell lines. Proxinium has also demonstrated anti-tumor activity in several human tumor xenograft animal models expressing EpCAM, including those derived from human squamous cell carcinomas and in a lung cancer subject derived xenograft, or PDX, model. In the PDX model, mice engrafted with human bone marrow cells were each implanted with two subcutaneous EpCAM-positive human PDX tumors. Tumor-bearing animals were treated with Proxinium alone in one tumor, an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor alone given systemically, or a combination of the two. Intratumoral injection of Proxinium into the tumor xenograft located on one side of the animal was able to block the growth of the tumor while also having a quantifiable anti-tumor effect on the uninjected tumor on the opposite flank. In contrast, the checkpoint inhibitor alone had little effect on tumor growth but appeared to amplify Proxinium’s activity on the uninjected tumor.

Proxinium treatment alone was also observed to increase the numbers of CD8+ T cells, an important cytotoxic immune cell population, in the blood. We believe that this indicates that the checkpoint inhibitor alone was ineffective in initiating the anti-tumor effects of immune cells without the prior activation of cancer specific immune cells by a cytotoxic regimen, such as Proxinium.
Further, synergistic and additive effects were observed in these in vitro pharmacology studies with Proxinium in combination with various anti-cancer agents, as well as with radiation therapy. Toxicological studies in Sprague-Dawley rats showed no clear evidence of systemic toxicity whether given via intradermal or subcutaneous injection. The only dose-related reactions were at the injection site with most lesions resolving by the end of the observation period. Plasma concentrations of animals in a seven-day toxicology study conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats were 50 ng/mL at four hours after squamous cell injection and approximately 1,000 ng/mL at 10 minutes following intravenous injection on day one. These blood levels were approximately 5- and 100-fold higher, respectively, than the mean Cmax measured in subjects administered 700 mg weekly for four weeks (10,936 pg/mL) through the intratumoral route. In in vivo pharmacology studies in human tumor xenograft mouse models, we observed evidence of tumor growth suppression.
In summary, in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical data have shown that the anti-cancer agent Proxinium preferentially binds to tumor cells and has an acceptable safety profile. The local and systemic toxicological profile for Proxinium in Sprague-Dawley rats has been defined with toxicological effects at doses 1,000-fold greater than the IC50 for activity on tumor cells.
First Phase 1 clinical trial. We initiated an open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of Proxinium in December 2003 at three sites in Russia. We enrolled 24 subjects with late-stage SCCHN who had previously undergone prior radiation therapy, with a majority having completed at least one chemotherapy cycle. In addition, based on our immunohistochemical test 
15

Table of Contents

used during this Phase 1 clinical trial of Proxinium, 17 of the 24 subjects (70.8%) enrolled in this Phase 1 clinical trial had tumors that tested positive for EpCAM. The Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK profile and efficacy endpoints.
In addition, information on PK properties and immunogenicity, as well as a preliminary assessment of tumor response, was obtained.
Subjects received two cycles of Proxinium administered once per day for five consecutive days, with doses ranging from 20 µg to 280 µg, followed by 23 days off. Two DLTs occurred at the 280 µg dose level, establishing 200 µg as the maximum tolerated dose. The DLTs observed in the two subjects were elevated liver enzyme tests, which were not associated with any signs of liver damage or toxicity, were asymptomatic and were transient as they resolved to baseline values.
Objective anti-tumor responses were measured by caliper, CT scans and digital photography from baseline to final assessment. Anti-tumor responses and stable disease were observed in six of the 14 (42.9%) and four of the 14 (28.6%) evaluable subjects with EpCAM-positive tumors, respectively, for an overall response rate of 71.4% (10 of the 14 evaluable subjects). All six of the evaluable subjects with EpCAM-negative tumors had progression of their target tumors. In addition, the 10 subjects with EpCAM-positive tumors and who had responses or stable disease had a survival time of 278 days compared with a survival time of 124 days for the six subjects with EpCAM-negative tumors. The 14 evaluable EpCAM-positive subjects had a survival time of 207 days. This Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in October 2004.
Second Phase 1 clinical trial. We initiated a second open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 clinical trial of Proxinium in June 2004 at four sites in Brazil. We enrolled 20 subjects with late-stage SCCHN. All of the subjects enrolled in this Phase 1 clinical trial had undergone prior radiation therapy, with a majority having completed at least one chemotherapy cycle. Eighteen of the 20 subjects (90%) tested positive for EpCAM, of which two subjects were non-clinically evaluable. Preliminary efficacy data indicated 14 of the 16 evaluable EpCAM-positive subjects (87.5%) had either a ‘‘complete resolution,’’ ‘‘response,’’ or ‘‘stable’’ disease of injected tumors following Proxinium treatment, with 25% of subjects achieving a ‘‘complete response’’ of the injected tumor. The second Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, tolerability, PK profile and efficacy endpoints.
Subjects received Proxinium once weekly for four weeks with initial doses ranging from 100 µg to 930 µg, followed up by four weeks with once weekly doses ranging from 100 µg to 930 µg. The maximum tolerated dose was established at 700 µg, based on the occurrence of DLTs in two of the five subjects at the 930 µg dose level cohort. The DLTs observed in the two subjects were elevated liver enzyme tests. In both cases, the elevated liver enzyme tests were not associated with any signs of liver damage or toxicity, were asymptomatic, and resolved to baseline values.
Therapeutic exploratory endpoints were analyzed to evaluate the tumor response and anti-tumor activity of Proxinium. RECIST criteria were not used in this Phase 1 clinical trial and instead the clinical investigator used the following definitions for tumor responses: ‘‘complete response’’ was the complete clinical resolution of a tumor (injected or non injected), ‘‘response’’ was defined as clinically and radiologically documented reduction in the size of the target tumor indicative of anti-tumor activity from baseline to final, ‘‘stable’’ was defined as no change in the disease state captured through clinical or radiological assessments from baseline to final and ‘‘progression’’ was defined as an increase in the size of the target tumor from baseline to the final assessment. 
The following table demonstrates the response rate of subjects with EpCAM-positive tumors in this Phase 1 clinical trial:

Number of | Complete | | Stable | Response of
evaluable subjects | response | Response | response | progression
16................................. | 4 of the 16 | 6 of the 16 | 4 of the 16 | 2 of the 16
 | (25.0%) | (37.5%) | (25.0%) | (12.5%) 

An example of a ‘‘complete’’ response obtained in a Proxinium injected tumor in the second Phase 1 clinical trial can be seen in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 4 below:

Table of Contents

A non injected tumor response was observed in four of the 20 subjects (20%) in the second Phase 1 clinical trial where subjects were administered Proxinium weekly and one of the 15 subjects (6.7%) in the Phase 2 clinical trial, which is discussed below, where subjects were administered Proxinium weekly. In such cases, tumor responses were seen in loco-regional tumors that themselves had not been injected with Proxinium, but were adjacent to, and in one case bi-lateral to the injected tumor. An example of a non-target tumor response is shown in FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 4 above. We believe that this non-target tumor response may be a consequence of surrounding cancer cells dying in response to Proxinium through diffusion (or the local spread of Proxinium) and cross priming of the immune system or the selective release of cancer antigens into the local immune tumor environment. This Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in March 2005.
Phase 2 clinical trial. We submitted the IND for Proxinium to the FDA in August 2005. We initiated an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Proxinium in March 2006 at nine sites in Canada and twenty-one sites in the United States. We enrolled 15 subjects with refractory locally recurrent disease, which means that the subject must have progressed on or after receiving, or was unable to tolerate, at least one anti-cancer treatment regimen or had to have previously documented refusal of treatment for locally recurrent disease. The Phase 2 clinical trial was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended dose of intratumorally injected Proxinium. Secondary objectives were to evaluate principal target tumor and target tumor response rates, determine the time to progression of the principal target tumor, overall survival time and progression-free survival, and also to confirm the PK profile and assess immunogenicity of intratumorally injected Proxinium.
The dosing regimen for our Phase 2 clinical trial included intratumoral injections once per week at 500µg or 700µg. Although the small sample size does not allow for statistical evaluation of treatment effects, it was expected that the Phase 2 clinical trial would provide some additional evidence of the therapeutic effect of Proxinium for control of local or regional late-stage SCCHN, as well as a survival benefit for those subjects. To be eligible for measurement of a radiographically confirmed response, a subject had to have a radiographic assessment at baseline/day one and at least two additional radiographic assessments, not less than four weeks apart, after day one. According to this definition, eight subjects were eligible for a principal tumor radiological response evaluation. In order to assess best tumor response, at least two CT scans, one at baseline and one post-baseline, were required. Best tumor response was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as the greatest degree of 
17

Table of Contents

decrease in tumor size observed throughout the clinical trial. Bidimensional tumor measurements were used to determine tumor size. Bidimensional measurements of a tumor were based on its longest diameter and the greatest perpendicular measurement from this diameter from CT scans.
RECIST criteria were not used in this Phase 2 clinical trial and instead the clinical investigator used the following definitions for tumor responses. A ‘‘complete response’’ was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as the clinically and radiologically documented complete disappearance of the principal target tumor or other target tumors, based on bidimensional measurement as determined by two radiological observations not less than four weeks apart. A ‘‘partial response’’ was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as a 50% or more decrease of the bidimensional measurements in the principal target tumor that had been measured as compared to baseline. ‘‘Progressive disease’’ was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as either: at least a 25% increase of the bidimensional measurements for tumors greater than four cm2 or at least a 50% increase of the bidimensional measurements for tumors less than four cm2 in the principal target tumor as compared to the nadir, which was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as the smallest radiologically determined tumor size achieved during the clinical trial. ‘‘Stable disease’’ was defined in this Phase 2 clinical trial as disease that meets neither the ‘‘partial response’’ nor the ‘‘progressive disease’’ criteria during or following active treatment and based on the sum of its bidimensional measurements, includes a less than 25% increase in tumor size for tumors greater than four cm2, or a less than 50% increase in tumor size for tumors less than four cm2. Tumor measurements that were radiographically confirmed showed that four of the eight evaluable subjects (50%) demonstrated ‘‘stable disease’’ for their principal tumor.
When radiographic best responses were evaluated at any two treatment time points, including baseline, 13 of the 14 evaluable subjects (92.9%) showed ‘‘stable disease’’ or partial response, with 10 of the 14 evaluable subjects (71.4%) showing a decrease in tumor size ranging from 4% to 85%. Measurements of the principal target tumors taken at baseline and at final visit showed that three of the eight evaluable subjects (37.5%) had decreases in principal tumor size ranging from 4% to 35%. Of five subjects with multiple tumors who achieved primary tumor responses, four of those subjects also achieved responses in subsequently injected non-primary tumors. These results suggest that Proxinium may be effective in the treatment of EpCAM-positive late-stage SCCHN.
This Phase 2 clinical trial was completed in August 2007.
Phase 3 clinical trial. We initiated a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial of Proxinium in January 2006 at 75 sites globally. Total enrollment was planned for 292 subjects with late-stage SCCHN and the protocol included two periods: a Phase 2 lead-in period comprised of 30 subjects and a Phase 3 period comprised of 262 subjects. Each subject’s locally recurrent disease had to be refractory, which means that the subject must have progressed on or after receiving, or was unable to tolerate, at least one anti-cancer treatment regimen or had to have previously documented refusal of treatment for locally recurrent disease.
This Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted to compare the overall survival time associated with intratumorally injected Proxinium and safety and efficacy data of Proxinium in combination with BSC versus BSC alone, in subjects with locally recurrent disease who had received at least one anti-cancer treatment regimen for such locally recurrent disease. Secondary objectives were to compare the loco-regional response rate and duration of loco-regional response, the local progression-free survival, symptomatic benefit and safety profile for subjects from the Proxinium in combination with BSC arm and the BSC alone arm.
During the treatment phase of this Phase 3 clinical trial, all subjects were assessed weekly and treated according to institutional standards of BSC, which included treatment measures such as the use of pain medication, hydration, antiemetics and nutritional support, but did not include the use of radiotherapy (except as needed for the palliation of distant metastases) or any agent that may have had an impact on tumor response. Subjects who were randomized to the BSC alone arm were either seen in the clinic or had weekly assessments conducted by phone; provided that at least one in-person visit was conducted every four weeks. Subjects who were randomized to Proxinium in combination with the BSC arm were also to receive BSC, as well as a once weekly intratumoral injection of Proxinium at 700 µg per dose. Subjects in both arms of this Phase 3 clinical trial continued in the treatment phase until either complete resolution of all target tumors or radiographic tumor progression occurred. All subjects were then to remain in the follow-up phase until one of the following occurred: (i) 12 months from the date that the last subject required for efficacy analyses had been randomized, died, withdrew or we terminated the trial or (ii) termination of the trial for safety reasons due to DLTs.
The intention of the Phase 2 period of the clinical trial was evaluation of available data once the first 30 subjects reached the four week treatment time point. Of the first 30 subjects enrolled, 15 were randomized to each study arm. The Phase 2 lead in period was specifically designed for the assessment of safety, with an independent review of the safety data by the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB. Following the review by the DSMB, they recommended the continuation of

enrollment and monitoring as mandated by the protocol since the available data indicated that intratumoral administration of Proxinium was generally well-tolerated by the subjects. The Phase 3 period began immediately after the conclusion of the Phase 2 period, with no pause in enrollment.
There were 62 subjects for which post-treatment tumor measurements were available, 36 subjects in the Proxinium in combination with the BSC arm and 26 subjects in the BSC alone arm. Responses in FIGURE 5 below represent the best percentage change in radiographically determined bidimensional measurement from baseline at any time point for the injected tumor. Of the Proxinium in combination with BSC arm, 19 of the 36 subjects (52.8%) showed tumor reduction with a median reduction in bidimensional tumor measurement of 48.3%. In contrast, only 10 of the 26 subjects (38.5%) of the BSC alone arm showed a median reduction in tumor size of 21.9%. With respect to the subjects for whom the best bidimensional percent change showed an increase in tumor size, the Proxinium in combination with BSC arm had 12 of the 36 subjects (33.3%) showing a median increase of 31.7%. The increase in tumor size was more pronounced in the BSC alone arm with 11 of the 26 subjects (42.3%) showing a median increase of 60.8%.
Targeted tumor responses in FIGURE 5 below were categorized as ‘‘complete,’’ ‘‘partial,’’ ‘‘stable,’’ or ‘‘progressive’’ disease. A ‘‘complete’’ response was defined as radiographically confirmed complete disappearance of disease, ‘‘partial’’ response as a 50% or more decrease of the sum of the product of the bidimensional measurements as compared to baseline, and ‘‘progressive’’ disease as at least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of the bidimensional measurements compared to the radiographic nadir, when the sum at baseline was greater than four cm2 or at least a 50% increase of the sum of the product(s) of the bidimensional measurements compared to the radiographic nadir, when the sum at baseline was less than or equal to four cm2. ‘‘Stable’’ disease was defined as the response when neither the complete response, partial response nor the progressive disease criteria were met.
This Phase 3 clinical trial was terminated in April 2008 because of challenges relating to subject enrollment and retention for reasons specific to emerging markets, but not due to safety or efficacy concerns. Clinical trial subject enrollment and retention in emerging markets presents unique challenges compared to North America. With fewer established options for communicating with existing and new subjects, emerging market study centers have difficulty acquiring new subjects as well as maintaining consistent contact with existing subjects, making follow up very difficult. We do not believe these issues will pose the same challenges in a North American clinical trial. In the United States, study centers have established multiple options to enroll and remain in communication with subjects.

At the time this Phase 3 clinical trial was terminated, 166 subjects had been randomized in the trial. Of these, 82 subjects were randomized to the Proxinium treatment in combination with the BSC arm and 84 subjects were randomized to the BSC alone arm (as discussed below).
Safety data. We believe that our safety and anti-tumor activity data in our two Phase 1 clinical trials, our Phase 2 clinical trial, and our partially completed Phase 3 clinical trial support further development of Proxinium. There were no Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigator to be related to Proxinium. The serious adverse events that were reported in the clinical trials of Proxinium and were considered to be possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment consisted of abnormal tumor growth, anorexia, cancer pain, decrease in red blood cells, difficulty swallowing, elevated calcium levels, facial pain, fatigue, high blood sugar, influenza like illness, injection site pain, liver function abnormalities, low albumin level, low sodium concentration, nausea, rash, swelling, tumor hemorrhage and tumor necrosis. 
Seven subjects died during the clinical trials of Proxinium, but none of the deaths were deemed to be related to Proxinium. Eleven subjects discontinued treatment due to liver function test abnormalities; however, the serum levels were transient and they eventually returned to baseline without any evidence of permanent liver damage. Four subjects withdrew from the clinical trials. Three of the four subjects withdrew at their request and one of the four subjects withdrew at the request of the investigator.
Proxinium Proposed Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial Plan
We intend to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial that will explore the potential of Proxinium in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor and are actively seeking partners for a combination program. We anticipate that the Phase 1/2a clinical trial will explore the potential for Proxinium, due to its potential immunogenic effect, to enhance checkpoint inhibitors in combination therapy for the treatment of SCCHN.
Overall, we believe that our efficacy and safety data support the continued clinical development of Proxinium to fulfill a significant unmet medical need in subjects with late-stage SCCHN.
We have deferred further development of Proxinium in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium. We are also exploring collaborations for Proxinium.
Potential future indications
Based on the safety and efficacy data in our two Phase 1 clinical trials, our Phase 2 clinical trial and our previous partially completed Phase 3 clinical trial of Proxinium, we also believe that there are several other potential applications for Proxinium that we may elect to pursue, including colon, thyroid and prostate cancers.
VB6-845d
Overview
Our lead systemically-administered product candidate, VB6-845d, is being developed as a treatment for multiple types of EpCAM-positive solid tumors. VB6-845d is a TPT consisting of an EpCAM targeting Fab genetically linked to deBouganin, which is administered by intravenous infusion. EpCAM is over-expressed on the cell surface of many solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, gastric, lung, ovarian and prostate. EpCAM overexpression has been shown to be involved in promoting malignant progression. In addition, EpCAM overexpression is associated with increased tumor grade, disease progression, increased proliferative phenotypes and diminished survival. EpCAM is also a cancer stem cell marker. A Phase 1 clinical trial conducted with VB6-845, the prior version of VB6-845d, revealed no clinically relevant immune response to the deBouganin payload, and five of seven subjects (71.4%) maintained stable disease (meaning no change in tumor size from baseline) after one completed cycle of treatment (four weeks) two subjects had decreases in target tumor size, and one subject who continued treatment through a third cycle (12 weeks) maintained stable disease. Interim safety data from our Phase 1 clinical trial was consistent with expectations for the study population of subjects with advanced solid tumors and the anticipated effects of targeted biological therapies containing immunogenic sequences.
Based upon the hypersensitivity reactions seen in our Phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Russia and in the country of Georgia, we de-immunized the Fab portion of VB6-845 to create VB6-845d. In April 2016, we submitted an IND to the FDA in preparation of initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB6-845d in subjects with EpCAM-positive cancers in the United States. The IND was withdrawn in July 2016 after we received initial feedback from the FDA indicating that they had identified hold and non-hold deficiencies that needed to be addressed. In December 2016, we submitted a request for a pre-IND meeting 
20

Table of Contents

to seek input on the manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical plans for VB6-845d prior to resubmitting an IND. In February 2017, the FDA provided guidance on our manufacturing and nonclinical plans for VB6-845d. Based on this guidance, we are performing additional studies and we plan on submitting an updated IND, once funding or a partner is secured for this program.
Overall, we believe that our pre-clinical data and the interim Phase 1 clinical data support further clinical investigation of VB6-845d to explore whether it may fulfill the significant unmet medical need in the treatment of subjects with EpCAM-positive solid tumors. Specifically, we believe that VB6-845d has potential to be a first-in-class TPT capable of providing clinical benefit in these difficult to treat patient populations.
We are currently developing VB6-845d, a recombinant fusion protein consisting of an anti-EpCAM fragment fused to a deBouganin payload for the systemic treatment of advanced solid tumors. DeBouganin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis and helps circumvent multi-drug resistance mechanisms. Solid tumors form an abnormal and discrete tumor mass in the body that usually does not contain cysts or liquid areas.
We believe that our TPTs utilizing our de-immunized deBouganin payload may be enhanced if combined with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe that deBouganin’s potential effect on cancer cells could promote an immunogenic response that may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors.
We have deferred further development of VB6-845d in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of Vicinium. We are also exploring collaborations for VB6-845d.
We own or exclusively license worldwide rights to our VB6-845d intellectual property portfolio that provides unextended patent term until at least 2025 and, if our pending composition of matter patent applications for VB6-845d are granted until at least 2036. See ‘‘Business-Intellectual Property’’ for additional details.
Clinical trials and pre-clinical studies
Pre-clinical studies. VB6-845, the prior version of VB6-845d, demonstrated strong binding and potent activity with small doses of the product candidate against numerous EpCAM-positive solid tumor cell lines, including those derived from tumors of the breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, gastric, lung and ovary, in in vitro pharmacology studies. In vitro and in vivo pre-clinical data have also demonstrated that VB6-845 preferentially binds to tumor cells expressing EpCAM and is effective in inhibiting tumor growth and increasing survival in mouse models. These xenograft studies demonstrated that VB6-845 was able to selectively affect EpCAM-expressing tumors without observed systemic toxicity. 
Phase 1 clinical trial. We received regulatory approval from the Federal Service on Surveillance in Healthcare and Social Development of the Russian Federation (Roszdravnadzor) to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial in Russia in March 2007 and from Ministry of Labour Health and Social Affairs of Georgia in April 2007. We initiated an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial of VB6-845 in May 2007 at five sites in Russia and one site in Georgia. We enrolled 15 subjects with EpCAM-positive solid tumors, including breast, colorectal, kidney, non-small cell lung, ovary, pancreas and stomach cancers. All subjects enrolled in this Phase 1 clinical trial had tumors that tested positive for EpCAM as confirmed by our immunohistochemical test used during this Phase 1 clinical trial of VB6-845. The Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to define the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate immunogenicity, safety. Secondary objectives included information on PK properties and assessing exploratory efficacy of VB6-845.
Subjects were treated over three dose cohorts in this Phase 1 clinical trial. VB6-845 was administered as a monotherapy intravenous infusion (for a period of over three hours), once weekly in four-week cycles, to subjects with EpCAM-positive advanced solid tumors. Subjects were evaluated at the end of each cycle. Three subjects at the first cohort dose level received 1.00 mg/kg, 10 subjects at the second cohort dose level received 2.00 mg/kg and two subjects at the third cohort dose level received 3.34 mg/kg. Following treatment of the subjects in the second cohort, the clinical reporting company reviewed the safety data and unanimously decided to escalate to the third cohort at a dose of 3.34 mg/kg. Out of the first group of five subjects in the second cohort, one DLT (an infusion-related reaction) was reported and confirmed by the clinical trial monitoring company. As the study was stopped early, no maximum tolerated dose was reached. VB6-845 was generally well-tolerated up to the third dose cohort (3.34 mg/kg).
One of our primary objectives in this Phase 1 clinical trial was to validate the extensive pre-clinical data supporting de-immunization of the deBouganin cytotoxic protein payload in humans. For a payload to be viable systemically it must be de-immunized to prevent rapid clearance by the immune system. Subject blood samples for the assessment of an anti-VB6-845 response were collected pre-infusion for the first cycle and every four weeks thereafter. An analysis of the antibody titers at each time point revealed a minimal immune response directed against the deBouganin moiety for only two subjects after eight 
21

weeks. Moreover, the titer of the immune response was just above the threshold of the assay (ranging between a titer of 1500 to 1800). These findings are consistent with significant de-immunization of the parent Bouganin cytotoxic protein payload via T-cell epitope depletion.
For all cohorts, exploratory efficacy data (CT and radiographic) were available for seven subjects who completed one full cycle (four weeks) of treatment. Five of the seven subjects showed stable disease, which means tumor measurement is unchanged relative to baseline, on CT scans one week after the completion of a fourth dose of VB6-845. Of the three subjects who continued to receive treatment past the first cycle, one subject continued to have stable disease at the completion of their second (eight weeks) and third (12 weeks) cycles. There was radiographic evidence of decreases in tumor size in two subjects with renal cell carcinoma and breast carcinoma. For one subject, six measurable target tumors in the lungs as well as a measurable target tumor in a pulmonary lymph node and pelvic mesentery showed decreases by CT scan ranging from 11% to 29% on a final visit relative to the baseline. Other non-target, non-measurable tumors appeared unchanged; although there was an appearance of disease progression as a potentially new brain tumor, which was inaccessible to treatment. In one other subject, CT scan results revealed decreases in four of the five measurable target tumors in the liver, with decreases in individual tumors ranging from 4% to 15%. Non-target, non-measurable tumors in lungs, liver and bones showed stable disease.
This Phase 1 clinical trial was terminated in April 2008. Subjects in this Phase 1 clinical trial exhibited little to no immune responses to the deBouganin payload, thereby demonstrating de-immunization of deBouganin. Subjects did, however, generate antibodies against the Fab molecule in the product candidate, specifically against mouse amino acid sequences that were left in the Fab to increase the thermal stability in this early version of the molecule. Taken together, we believe this demonstrated that the subjects were fully immunocompetent, which means that they were capable of rejecting the deBouganin payload if their immune system recognized it as foreign. Furthermore, it is important to note that the deBouganin payload was presented to the subjects’ immune system as a fusion with the immunogenic Fab fragment. The ‘‘hapten-carrier effect’’ principal in immunology dictates that presenting a non-immunogenic ‘‘hapten’’ protein (deBouganin) to the immune system as a conjugate or fusion to an immunogenic ‘‘carrier’’ protein (Fab with mouse amino acid sequences) is an effective way to amplify the immunogenicity of the non-immunogenic protein. Our observation of a lack of immunogenicity of deBouganin in this setting is further evidence of its de-immunization. We have since engineered these mouse amino acid sequences out of VB6-845, which we refer to as VB6-845d, and based upon a binding specificity pre-clinical study, VB6-845d retained biologic activity.

The chart below demonstrates why we believe that we have successfully de-immunized VB6-845 to create VB6-845d as shown by in a Phase 1 clinical trial that revealed no clinically relevant immune response to the deBouganin payload.

Safety data. We believe that the interim safety data from the 15 subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial support further development of VB6-845d. There were no Grade 5 serious adverse events that were considered by the clinical investigator to be related to VB6-845. The Grade 3 and Grade 4 serious adverse events that were reported in the Phase 1 clinical trial of VB6-845 and considered to be possibly, probably or definitely related to treatment, consisting of an infusion related reaction and an infusion site reaction that are consistent with the immunogenic nature of the Fab fragment. The subject’s condition improved and the event was considered to be resolved one day after onset without any further clinical concerns. The subject with the infusion related reaction was discontinued from the Phase 1 clinical trial in accordance with the protocol treatment stopping criteria defined for Grade 4 serious adverse events. The adverse event data reported for the subjects at the time the Phase 1 clinical trial was terminated was based upon interim data.
VB6-845d Phase1/2 clinical trial development plan
In April 2016, we submitted an IND to the FDA in preparation of initiating a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VB6-845d in subjects with EpCAM-positive cancers in the United States. The IND was withdrawn in July 2016 after we received initial feedback from the FDA indicating that they had identified hold and non-hold deficiencies that needed to be addressed. In December 2016, we submitted a request for a pre-IND meeting to seek input on the manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical plans for VB6-845d prior to resubmitting an IND. In February 2017, the FDA provided guidance on our manufacturing and nonclinical plans for VB6-845d. Based on this guidance, we are performing additional studies and plan on submitting an updated IND.
Overall, we believe that our pre-clinical data and the interim Phase 1 clinical data support further clinical investigation of VB6-845d to explore whether it may fulfill the significant unmet medical need in the treatment of subjects with EpCAM-positive solid tumors. We also believe that the deBouganin payload in VB6-845d may enhance the action of checkpoint inhibitors as a result of the promotion of a local tumor immune response following the death of cancer cells.

License Agreements
License agreement with The University of Zurich
Overview and exclusivity. We have a license agreement with Zurich, which grants us exclusive rights, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use, and sell under certain patents primarily directed to our targeting agent, including EpCAM chimera, and related immunoconjugates and methods of use and manufacture of the same. These patents cover some key aspects of our product candidates Vicinium and Proxinium. Under the terms of the agreement, we may be obligated to pay $750,000 in milestone payments, for the first product candidate that achieves applicable clinical development milestones. Based on current clinical status, we anticipate that these milestones may be triggered by Vicinium’s clinical development pathway. As part of the consideration, we will also be obligated to pay a 4% royalty on the net product sales for products covered by or manufactured using a method covered by a valid claim in the Zurich patent rights. We have the right to reduce the obligation to pay royalties in a particular country expires upon the expiration or termination of the last of the Zurich patent rights that covers the manufacture, use or sale of a product. There is no obligation to pay royalties in a country if there is no valid claim that covers the product or a method of manufacturing the product. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, aggregate license fees of $250,000 have been paid to Zurich by Viventia prior to our acquisition of Viventia. There were no payment made for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Patent rights. We are responsible for the patent filing, prosecution and maintenance activities pertaining to the patent rights, at our sole expense, while Zurich is afforded reasonable opportunities to review and comment on such activities. If appropriate, we shall apply for an extension of the term of any licensed patent where available, for example, in at least the United States, Europe and Japan. In the event of any substantial infringement of the patent rights, we may request Zurich to take action to enforce the licensed patents against third parties. If the infringing activity is not abated within 90 days and Zurich has elected not to take legal action, we may take legal action (in Zurich’s name, if necessary). Such action will be at our own expense and Zurich will have the opportunity to join at its own expense. Recoveries from any action shall generally belong to the party bringing the suit, but (a) in the event that we bring the action and an acceptable settlement or monetary damages are awarded, then Zurich will be reimbursed for any amount that would have been due to Zurich if the products sold by the infringer actually had been sold by us, or (b) in the event a joint legal action is brought, then the parties shall share the expense and recoveries shall be shared in proportion to the share of expense paid by the respective party. Each party is required to cooperate with the other in litigation proceedings at the expense of the party bringing the action.
Term and termination. The term of the agreement expires as of the expiration date of the last patent to expire within the Zurich patent rights. We are currently projecting an expiration date for the U.S. licensed patents in 2024, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available on a jurisdictional basis. Zurich has the right to terminate

the agreement if we breach any obligation of the agreement and fail to cure such breach within the applicable cure periods. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time and for any reason by giving 90 days written notice to Zurich.
License Agreement with Merck KGaA
Overview and exclusivity. In March 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Biovation Limited, subsequently acquired by Merck, which was subsequently amended and restated in October 2015. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents and technology relating to the de-immunization of our cytotoxin Bouganin for therapeutic and in vivo diagnostic purposes in humans. The de-immunized cytotoxin is known as deBouganin, and has been incorporated into our product candidate, VB6-845d. We have the worldwide exclusive right, with the right to sublicense, under the licensed patents and technology to, among other things, make, have made, use or sell products incorporating deBouganin.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, aggregate license fees of $225,000 have been paid to Merck by Viventia prior to our acquisition of Viventia. There were no payments made for the year ended December 31, 2017. Under the agreement, we may be obligated to pay certain clinical development and regulatory milestones for each ‘‘licensed product’’: (A) $2,000,000 upon the start of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for a licensed product; (B) $2,000,000 upon submission of the first BLA for a licensed product; (C) $2,000,000 upon the approval of the first BLA in certain countries for a licensed product and $1,000,000 upon each of the second and third approvals of a BLA in certain additional countries for the same licensed product (total of $4,000,000); and (D) $2,000,000 upon the approval of the second BLA in certain countries for a licensed product; and $1,000,000 upon each of the second and third approvals of the second BLA in certain additional countries for the same licensed product (total of $4,000,000). As part of the consideration, we are obligated to pay a 1.5% royalty on the net product sales up to $150,000,000 and a 2% royalty on the net product sales above such amount. 
Patent rights. We have the first right to file, prosecute and maintain licensed patents relating to de-immunized plasmids and proteins, including, among other things, our deBouganin and Merck has the first right to file, prosecute and maintain any other licensed patents. We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the licensed patents against third parties for suspected infringement, and, after repayment of costs and expenses, any recoveries under such suit will be treated as net product sales and we shall pay a royalty on the same. We may not settle such patent infringement suit without the prior written consent of Merck, but such consent shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. If we decline to enforce the licensed patents against third parties for suspected infringement, Merck may bring such a patent infringement suit and any recoveries will be retained by Merck.
Term and termination. The agreement expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the longer of (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent within the licensed patent rights that covers a licensed product and (ii) 10 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country; provided that no royalty is payable for more than 15 years from the first commercial launch of a licensed product anywhere in the world. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement for breach of the agreement and if the other party fails to cure such breach within the applicable cure period. We have the right to terminate the agreement by giving Merck six months prior written notice.
Manufacturing
We maintain an approximately 31,400 square foot manufacturing, laboratory, warehouse and office facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. We have three 15 liter fermentors, one 150 liter fermentor, one 500 liter fermentor and one 1,500 liter fermentor. Our classified fermentation suite and post-production processing capabilities were dedicated to producing our pre-clinical study and clinical trial batches. In September 2017, we completed the manufacturing of all Vicinium necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 registration trial in patients with NMIBC, and for our CRADA with the NCI. In conjunction with this achievement, we are ending our large-scale manufacturing activities and redirecting resources toward completing our Phase 3 trial. In the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market any of our product candidates, we will need to outsource our commercial scale manufacturing to contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. We are currently in the process of identifying a CMO and evaluating the manufacturing technology transfer process to that CMO. 
Commercial Operations
We do not currently have an organization structured for the sales, marketing and distribution of products. We may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic collaborators for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would 
28

have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to the approval of any of our product candidates.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and has a strong emphasis on developing proprietary products. While we believe that our next generation TPT platform, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations; specifically with companies, institutions and organizations that are actively researching and developing products that attach proprietary cell-killing payloads to antibodies for targeted delivery to cancer cells. Our competitors include, but are not limited to:

• | NMIBC: Aadi, LLC (ABI-009), Altor Bioscience Corporation (ALT-801), Cold Genesys, Inc. (CG0070), Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Valstar) (approved drug), FKD Therapies Oy (Instilidrin), Merck and other pharmaceutical companies (BCG) (approved drug), Eli Lilly and Company (Gemcitabine) and Telormedix SA (Vesimune);


• | SCCHN: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (nivolumab)(approved drug), Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux, pembrolizumab) (approved drugs);


• | Multiple types of solid tumors: Amgen Inc. (Panitumumab) (approved drug), Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals (Sorafenib) (approved drug), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, and Merck (Erbitux) (approved drug), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Bevacizumab) (approved drug), Genentech, Inc. (Bevacizumab, Erlotinib and Trastuzumab) (approved drugs), Pfizer, Inc. (Sunitinib) and Trion Research GmbH (Removab); and


• | In addition to competition from alternative treatments, we may also face competition from products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, our product candidates. Biosimilar products are expected to become available over the coming years. Even if our product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive biosimilar products if any have been approved by then and insurers or other third party payors may encourage or even require the use of lower priced biosimilar products. Even if our treatments receive market authorization, they may not be listed on the formularies of payors (public or private insurers) or reimbursed. This may impact the uptake of the drug as a treatment option for patients and/or the price at which the drug can be sold at. Further, if the drug is reimbursed it may be at a narrower indication than the full scope of market authorization.

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. These competitors are also active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Moreover, specialized biologics, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or cheaper than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our product’s entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the drug design, effectiveness against multi-drug resistance mechanisms, efficacy, safety, price and convenience of our product candidates.
Government Regulation
As a clinical-stage biologics company, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and other national, supranational, state, provincial and local regulatory agencies. We are also subject to extensive regulation by similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we operate. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, post-approval monitoring and reporting, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope to that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the E.U. are addressed in a centralized way through the European Commission following the opinion of the EMA, but country-specific regulation in the individual European Union Member States, or the E.U. Member States, remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the 
29

Table of Contents

subsequent compliance with appropriate supranational, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and we may not be successful in any given jurisdiction.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, drug products are regulated by the FDA under the FDCA and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the PHSA. Drug products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. A failure to comply with any applicable requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, including, among other things, the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, or administrative, civil and/or criminal investigation, penalties or prosecution.
In the United States, all of our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a BLA, and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. Manufacturers of biologics may also be subject to state and local regulation.
The steps required before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally include:

• | completion of pre-clinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies, some in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations, and the Animal Welfare Act administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;


• | approval by an IRB before each trial may be initiated at each clinical site;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials under protocols submitted to FDA for review and approval by each IRB, conducted in accordance with federal regulations and with current Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biologic for each targeted indication;


• | submission of a BLA to the FDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.

Pre-clinical studies
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including, as applicable, GLP and the Animal Welfare Act. The results of the pre-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA evaluates the IND to determine whether there is an adequate basis for starting the drug in initial clinical studies, and the IND must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced. Additional pre-clinical studies may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If during this 30-day period the FDA does not raise any concerns or issues that must be addressed prior to the commencement of clinical trials or does not impose a clinical hold, the IND becomes effective 30 days following the FDA’s receipt of the IND and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation and must be conducted in compliance with (i) federal regulations, (ii) GCP standards, which set safeguards to protect the rights and health of patients and establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting results of clinical trials, and (iii) protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if any. Foreign studies conducted under an IND generally must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. 
30

Table of Contents

The informed written consent of each study subject must be obtained before the subject may begin participation in the clinical trial. The study protocol, study plan, and informed consent forms for each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an IRB for each trial site. Investigators and IRBs must also comply with FDA regulations and guidelines, including regarding oversight of study subject informed consent, complying with the study protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. The clinical trial program for a product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases are as follows:

• | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically conducted in healthy human subjects, but in some situations are conducted in subjects with the target disease or condition. These clinical trials are generally designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PK properties and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s PK properties and pharmacological effects may be obtained to inform and support the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80;


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to obtain initial evidence of effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication(s) in subjects with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, gather additional information on possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited subject population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants; and


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product candidate has been obtained and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate, although a single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances.

The decision to suspend or terminate development of a product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, by an IRB, or by a company for various reasons and during any phase of clinical trials. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by a DSMB, which is an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor to evaluate at designated points in time whether or not a trial may move forward and/or should be modified. These decisions are based on unblinded access to data from the ongoing trial and generally involve determinations regarding the benefit-risk ratio for study subjects and the scientific integrity and validity of the clinical trial.
In addition, there are requirements for the registration of certain clinical trials of product candidates on public registries, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, and the submission of certain information pertaining to these trials, including clinical trial results after trial completion.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, a sponsor submits extensive information about the product candidate information to the FDA in the form of a BLA to request marketing approval for the product candidate in specified indications.
Biologics License Applications
In order to obtain approval to market a biologic in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. For example, in November 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document on developing new drugs and biologics for treating BCG-unresponsive NMIBC, and 
31

Table of Contents

finalized this guidance in February 2018. Our BLA for Vicinium may have to meet the expectations set forth in this guidance document to obtain approval. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing an original BLA, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial, subject to certain limited deferrals, waivers and reductions that may be available. The FDA has 60 days from receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to accept for filing any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, in which case the BLA will have to be updated and resubmitted. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal is to review 90% of priority BLA applications and original efficacy supplements within six months of filing and 90% of standard applications and original efficacy supplements within 10 months of filing, whereupon a decision is to be made, but the FDA can and frequently does extend this review timeline to consider certain later-submitted information or information intended to clarify or supplement information provided in the initial submission. The FDA may not complete its review or approve a BLA within these established goal review times. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured or the facilities that are significantly involved in the product development and distribution process, and will not approve the product candidate unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain BLAs must include an assessment, generally based on clinical trial data, of the safety and effectiveness of the biological product in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at a company’s request or by its own initiative, including waivers for certain products not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. Products with orphan drug designation are exempt from these requirements for orphan-designated indications with no formal waiver process required.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA’s PDUFA review goal to review such resubmissions is two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval of a resubmitted BLA. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include Medication Guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and also may include elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the biologic. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the biologic’s safety, purity, or potency, which can be costly.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or a supplemental BLA before the change can be implemented. A supplemental BLA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing a supplemental BLA as it does in reviewing a new BLA.
Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, new or modified government requirements, including from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development or affect our ability to maintain product approvals we have obtained.

FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a product candidate depends on identifying appropriate patients through an in vitro diagnostic test, then the FDA generally will require approval of a diagnostic test, known as an in vitro companion diagnostic device, or companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the product candidate. The FDA issued an August 2014 guidance document addressing companion diagnostics. The FDA has required sponsors using companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for those diagnostics. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. During a Type C meeting with FDA in 2007, the FDA noted that approval of a companion diagnostic for EpCAM expression would need to coincide with Proxinium approval. We intend to clarify whether the FDA still believes that a companion diagnostic is necessary for approval of Proxinium.
PMA applications involve a rigorous premarket development program during which the applicant must generate and provide the FDA with extensive data, including from pre-clinical and clinical studies, supporting the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. For a diagnostic device, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a denial of approval or a “not approvable” letter based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA may issue an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue an approval letter for the approved indications, which may be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Medical devices remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements after being approved or cleared, including under the QSR.
Biosimilars and market exclusivity
Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, the FDA can approve products that are biosimilar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. To be biosimilar, a biological product can have no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy from the reference product. An interchangeable biosimilar product must meet additional standards for interchangeability and, if approved, may be substituted for the reference product. At this juncture, it is unclear whether any product deemed ‘‘interchangeable’’ by the FDA, in fact, will be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, a manufacturer may file an application for approval of a ‘‘biosimilar’’ version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA under the PHSA. The BPCIA also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA. Although the patents for the reference biologic may be challenged by the biosimilar applicant during that time period pursuant to the BPCIA statutory patent challenge framework, no biosimilar or interchangeable product will be licensed by the FDA until the end of the exclusivity period. The first biologic product candidate submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against any other determinations of interchangeability to the reference product for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the interchangeable biosimilar product, (ii) 18 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the interchangeable biosimilar product applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the reference product’s patents, and (iv) 42 months after approval of the interchangeable biosimilar product if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
33

Table of Contents

The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which established abbreviated pathways for the approval of generic drugs. The FDA has published several guidance documents providing direction on developing and obtaining approval of biosimilar product candidates. The guidance documents to date explain, among other things, that the FDA will approve a biosimilar product if there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. A determination of biosimilarity may be based upon: (1) analytical studies showing that the biological product is highly similar to, with no clinically meaningful differences from, the reference product, (2) animal studies, including toxicity assessments, and/or (3) a clinical trial or trials (including assessment of immunogenicity and PKs or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency. The FDA recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach to developing the data and information needed to support biosimiliarity. At each step, the sponsor should evaluate the extent of residual uncertainty of biosimilarity that remains and incorporate the FDA’s advice for additional studies to address remaining uncertainty. To meet the higher standard for interchangeability the sponsor must demonstrate, in addition to biosimilarity, that the proposed biological product can be expected to produce the same clinical result and, if administered more than once to any given patient, the safety risk and potential for diminished efficacy associated with switching between the proposed biological product and the reference product is not greater than continuing to use the reference product. A biological product that is determined to be interchangeable may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. In March 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar product under the BPCIA, and it has approved other biosimilar products since then. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, the approval of a biologic product biosimilar to one of our products could have a material impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our products, if approved by the FDA.
The ‘‘Purple Book,’’ first published by the FDA in September 2014, lists biological products, including any biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed by the FDA under the PHSA. The lists include the date a biological product was licensed under Section 351(a) of the PHSA and whether the FDA evaluated the biological product for reference product exclusivity under Section 351(k)(7) of the PHSA. The Purple Book will also enable a user to see whether a biological product licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA has been determined by the FDA to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference biological product (an already-licensed FDA biological product). Biosimilar and interchangeable biological products licensed under Section 351(k) of the PHSA will be listed under the reference product to which biosimilarity or interchangeability was demonstrated.
Advertising and promotion
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of biologics through standards and regulations for, among other things, direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A biologic cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, promotion of a biologic can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA.
Healthcare providers are permitted, however, to prescribe products for unapproved uses (also known as ‘‘off-label’’ uses) – that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling – because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA restricts manufacturers’ communications regarding unapproved uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for an unapproved use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding unapproved uses under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, or the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, as well as state authorities. Such enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes products.
Post-approval regulation
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that subjects in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the product. In addition, as a holder of an approved BLA, a company would be required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products.

The manufacturing of our product candidates is required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. Our product candidates were manufactured at our production plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In September 2017 we completed the manufacturing of all Vicinium necessary for our ongoing Phase 3 registration trial in patients with NMIBC, and for our CRADA with the NCI. In the event we obtain approval from the FDA to market any of our product candidates, we will need to outsource our commercial scale manufacturing to CMOs. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to assure and preserve the long term stability of the biological product. Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. The FDA and certain state agencies periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements, and other laws.
Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product or the manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, as well as lead to potential market disruptions. These restrictions may include suspension of product manufacturing until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a ‘‘consent decree,’’ which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. Other potential consequences include interruption of production, issuance of warning letters or other enforcement letters, refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, product seizure or detention, and injunctions or imposition of civil and/or criminal penalties.
In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation, correction, and reporting of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as additional post-market clinical trials to assess new safety risks or distribution-related or other restrictions under a REMS.
Patent Term Extension
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. The provisions of the Hatch-Waxman act permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Many other countries also provide for patent term extensions or similar extensions of patent protection for biologic products. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in Europe, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Canadian Government Regulation
In Canada, Health Canada is responsible for the regulation of pharmaceuticals under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act and the Food and Drug Regulations. Any compound that fits under the definition of ‘‘drug’’ as defined in the Food and Drugs Act must undergo a series of trials (for example, Phase 1, 2 and 3, similar to the United States) to demonstrate it is both safe and effective before it can be marketed in Canada. Approval is based on a risk-benefit assessment, in which the therapeutic benefits are weighed against the risks associated with taking the drug.
All clinical drug trials taking place in Canada are regulated through the Food and Drug Regulations, which is supplemented by the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidelines. A failure to comply with any requirements during product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include fines, suspension or cancellation of regulatory approvals, closure of a clinical trial, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, criminal penalties, and criminal prosecution. Our product candidates are biologics and therefore come under the purview of the Biologics and Genetic Therapies Directorate of Health Canada. To receive approval from Health Canada, biologics, like all drugs, must be shown to be safe and effective. In addition, biologics must be shown to be of suitable quality in terms of both chemistry and manufacturing. This latter requirement increases the regulatory burden, requiring additional submissions and mandatory inspections with respect to the method of manufacture, similar to that in the United States. Health Canada also has rules relating to the approval of subsequent entry biologics in Canada, following the expiry of an innovator biologic’s data exclusivity and/or patent protection.
The Canadian drug approval process requires submission and approval of a CTA as well as approval by a Research Ethics Board before each phase of human clinical trials is commenced. Canadian clinical trial development is similar to the clinical trial phases of the United States.
Exclusivity
Under the Food and Drug Regulations there are data exclusivity provisions for ‘‘innovative drugs’’ that have not been previously approved in a drug by the relevant Minister and that is not a variation of a previously approved medicinal ingredient such as a salt, ester, enantiomer, or polymorph. The term of data exclusivity is presently eight years from the date of first market approval which can be extended to an additional six months for pediatric indications if an innovator includes, in its new drug submission, or any supplement to that new drug submission filed within the first five years of the eight-year data protection period, results of clinical trials which were designed and conducted with the purpose of increasing knowledge about the use of the drug in pediatric populations and which will lead to a health benefit for children.
Also, provided certain requirements are met, the newly implemented Certificate of Supplementary Protection regime in Canada (intended to partly compensate for time spent in research and obtaining marketing authorization) can provide for up to two years of additional protection from the expiry of a patent, for drugs containing a new medicinal ingredient, or a combination thereof, protected by an eligible patent.
In addition, Canada, similar to the United States, has patent/regulatory linkage provisions. The Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations enable a patent with claims to the medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage form or use to be listed on the Patent Register. A second person who files a drug submission that directly or indirectly compares itself to a drug wherein there is a patent on the Patent Register will not obtain market authorization for their product until the patent term has expired, it is determined that they will not be infringing the patent, the patent is held invalid or the inclusion of the patent on the Patent Register is found to have been made through certain false statements. Although a stay pending the outcomes of any associated proceedings (up to two years) may be obtained, it can be costly, and success is not guaranteed. If a company is not successful in any such proceeding, they may be liable for damages and also may result in a competitor’s product receiving market authorization.
Advertising, Promotion and Compliance
Advertising and promotion of health products, particular prescription drugs/biologics is regulated primarily by Health Canada pursuant to the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, by standards set by the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board, Advertising Standards Canada and industry associations, such as Innovative Medicines Canada, the national association representing Canadians who work for Canadian research-based pharmaceutical companies, and their Code of Ethical Practices. In addition, Canada has the Competition Act and the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act. All of these define how drugs can be advertised and what are or are not permitted activities and interactions with public officials, healthcare professionals, the public and other stakeholders. For example, in Canada direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs is generally prohibited. Failure to comply can result in sanctions, fines, suspension or cancellation of regulatory approvals, closure of a

clinical trial, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, criminal penalties, and criminal prosecution.
European Union and other international government regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a CTA much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the E.U., for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States where the clinical trial is conducted and to an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
Marketing authorization application for biologic medicinal products in the European Union and in other foreign countries
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under E.U. regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application.
In the E.U., a marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (single country). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products and biologic products and optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health.
In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission takes a final decision to grant a centralised marketing authorization which permits the marketing of a product in all 28 E.U. Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Under the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP).
For other countries outside of the E.U., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCPs, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Advertising, Promotion and Compliance
In the E.U., the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to E.U. laws and E.U. Member States’ national laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Other E.U. Member State national legislation may also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. The SmPC forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion and is prohibited in the E.U. The applicable laws at the E.U. level and in the individual E.U. Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the E.U. could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These penalties imposed by the European Commission, the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could include the imposition of a clinical

hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Regulation of in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the European Union
In the E.U., companion diagnostics are regulated as in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or IVDs. Manufacturers of IVDs are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or the IVD Directive. Compliance with these requirements entitles manufacturers to affix the CE mark to their IVDs, without which they cannot be commercialized in the E.U. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the IVD Directive and obtain the right to affix the CE mark to the IVDs, manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of IVDs. The IVD Directive groups IVDs into four categories based on the risks associated with relative dangers to public health and / or patient treatment by an IVD failing to perform as intended:

• | General IVDs;


• | IVDs for self-testing;


• | IVDs falling within the scope of Annex II, List A:


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining the following blood groups: ABO system, rhesus (C, c, D, E, e), or anti-Kell; and


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for the detection, confirmation and quantification in human specimens of markers of human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, infection (HIV 1 and 2), human T-lymphotropic virus I and II, and hepatitis B, C and D.


• | IVDs falling within the scope of Annex II, List B:


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining the following blood groups: anti-Duffy and anti-Kidd;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining irregular anti-erythrocyte antibodies;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for the detection and quantification in human samples of the following congenital infections: rubella, toxoplasmosis;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for diagnosing the following hereditary disease: phenylketonuria;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining the following human infections: cytomegalovirus, chlamydia;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining the following human leukocyte antigen tissue groups: DR, A, B;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators and control materials, for determining the following tumoral marker: prostate-specific antigen;


• | reagents and reagent products, including related calibrators, control materials and software, designed specifically for evaluating the risk of trisomy 21; and


• | the following device for self-diagnosis, including its related calibrators and control materials: device for the measurement of blood sugar.

Following determination of the appropriate category for an IVD, manufacturers are required to follow the related conformity assessment procedures laid down in Article 9 of the IVD Directive.
For general IVDs, a self-assessment process in accordance with Annex III of the IVD Directive and a related Declaration of Conformity by the manufacturer prior to affixing the CE mark is sufficient. In the Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer certifies that its product complies with the Essential Requirements provided for in Annex I to the IVD Directive.
38

Table of Contents

For IVD for self-testing and those falling within List A or B of Annex II to the IVD, a notified body must undertake an assessment of the conformity of the manufacturer and/or the device with the applicable provisions of the IVD Directive.
The notified body would commonly audit and examine a product Technical File and the quality management system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of a medical device before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the IVD Directive. Following the issuance of a CE Certificate of Conformity, manufacturers can draw up the Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by the CE Certificate of Conformity and the Declaration of Conformity.
In the European Union, companion diagnostics for EpCAM expression are regulated as general IVDs. The involvement of a notified body during the conformity assessment procedure is not, therefore, currently required. This situation will, however, change with the new Regulation on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices, or IVDR, which will be applicable from May 26, 2022. The Regulation, which will replace the IVD Directive from May 2022, will substantially impact IVD manufacturers. In accordance with the new IVDR, companion diagnostics will be regulated as Class C IVDs and a notified body will be required to participate in the related conformity assessment procedure.
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the E.U., the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants Orphan Drug Designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the E.U. community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the E.U. would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the biologic.
In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for the same biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. The FDA can revoke a product’s orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the product sponsor is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the product to meet patient needs. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition.
In the E.U., medicinal products: (a) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect no more than five in 10,000 people in the E.U.; or (b) that are used to treat or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and that, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives; and (c) where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned exists, or, if such a method exists, the medicinal product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, may be granted an orphan designation in the E.U. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved by the European Commission before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, Orphan medicinal product designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. Moreover, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following biologic approval. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the E.U. Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. This period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years, at the end of the fifth year, if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the ten-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:
39

Table of Contents


• | The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

There is currently no orphan drug designation in Canada.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval or marketing authorization. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Proxinium has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the EMA.
Expedited Programs in the United States and Other Jurisdictions
In the United States, a product may be granted fast track designation if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition. With fast-track designation, the sponsor may be eligible for more frequent opportunities to obtain the FDA’s feedback, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This ‘‘rolling review’’ is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. Even if a product receives fast-track designation, the designation can be rescinded and provides no assurance that a product will be reviewed or approved more expeditiously than would otherwise have been the case, or that the product will be approved at all.
FDA may designate a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if it finds that the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other product candidates or approved products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. For product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies, more frequent interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review. We may apply for breakthrough therapy designation for some of our product candidates. However, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and, in any event, does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for designation.
Accelerated approval under FDA regulations allows a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available therapies to be approved on the basis of either an intermediate clinical endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for confirmatory clinical trials to be conducted with due diligence to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm clinical benefit, and for all promotional materials to be submitted to the FDA for review prior to dissemination.
FDA may grant priority review designation to a product candidate, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA filing, or eight months from the sponsor’s submission. Priority review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in safety or efficacy compared to available therapy. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA filing, or 12 months from sponsor submission. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
In Canada, Health Canada has a Priority Review Process, allowing for shortened review targets of eligible drug submissions. Eligibility for Priority Review is similar to that of the United States. The drug submission must be for a serious, life-threatening or severely debilitating disease or condition for which there is substantial evidence of clinical effectiveness that the drug provides (a) effective treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease or condition for which no drug is presently 
40

Table of Contents

marketed in Canada; or (b) a significant increase in efficacy and/or significant decrease in risk such that the overall benefit/risk profile is improved over existing therapies, preventatives or diagnostic agents for a disease or condition that is not adequately managed by a drug marketed in Canada. Priority Review does not change the quality, safety, or efficacy requirements of the submission; it just shortens Health Canada’s target review timeline from 300 days down to 180 days.
Under the Centralized Procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding ‘‘clock stops,’’ when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: (1) the seriousness of the disease (for example, heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated, (2) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and (3) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of CHMP is given within 150 days.
Proxinium has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any collaborators, may receive for any approved products.
In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or Medicare Modernization Act, established the Medicare Part D program and generally authorized prescription drug plan sponsors to impose limits on the number of covered drugs under their plans in a therapeutic class. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage and reimbursement rate that we may receive for any of our product candidates, if approved. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency that runs the Medicare program, also may revise reimbursement and implement coverage restrictions. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which would then affect the price we can receive. Private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement from federal legislation or regulation may lead to similar reductions in private payor reimbursement.
In addition, in March 2010, the President of the United States signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades. The Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act has impacted existing government healthcare programs and has resulted in the development of new programs. For example, the Affordable Care Act provides for Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program.
Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

• | an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription products and biological products;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% for innovator drugs and 13% for non-innovator drugs of the average manufacturer price;


• | a new methodology by which average manufacturer price is calculated and reported by manufacturers for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies;


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;


• | a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, or Medicare Part D, coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;

41

Table of Contents


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service 340B pharmaceutical pricing program;


• | new requirements to report to CMS annually specifying financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any ‘‘payments or other transfers of value’’ made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year;


• | a new requirement to annually report product samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;


• | a mandatory non-deductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents;


• | establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payments and service delivery models;


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and


• | a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents.

The Affordable Care Act also establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for pharmaceutical products. A proposal made by the IPAB is required to be implemented by the U.S. federal government’s CMS unless Congress adopts a proposal with savings greater than those proposed by the IPAB. IPAB proposals may impact payments for physician and free-standing services beginning in 2015 and for hospital services beginning in 2020.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, for example, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. Subsequent legislation has extended the reduction through 2025. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2% per fiscal year.
In January 2013, the President signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additional legislative changes, FDA or CMS regulations, guidance or interpretations could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement of our product candidates. For example, in November 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives formed an Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force to advance legislation intended to control pharmaceutical drug costs and investigate pharmaceutical drug pricing, and the U.S. Senate has requested information from certain pharmaceutical companies in connection with an investigation into pharmaceutical drug pricing practices.
Certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, beginning in 2019. Additional legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible. We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any

approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a biologic may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the biologic. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the products approved by the FDA, Health Canada or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for a particular indication or if a product is included it may not be listed on the formulary for all the indications or it may be listed on a narrower basis than what is approved by the FDA, Health Canada or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA, Health Canada or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the United States Congress enacted legislation providing Medicare Part D, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the United States continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In Canada, the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board evaluates and controls excessive pricing of patented products. Further, there are national, provincial and territorial formularies funded by government healthcare systems, in addition to formularies for private payors (private insurers) and hospitals or hospital groups. Listing on the formularies and price depend on evidence and submissions regarding the cost-benefit of the drug and comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies and is often subject to negotiations.
In the E.U., once a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product the applicant is required to engage in pricing and reimbursement discussions and negotiate with a separate pricing authority in each of the E.U. Member States. The E.U. Member States governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of the E.U. Member States may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other E.U. Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly pharmaceuticals, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Furthermore, an increasing number of E.U. Member States and other foreign countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of medicinal products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere. The E.U. Member States have discretion to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An E.U. Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our products, if approved, from lower priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The sole legal instrument at the E.U. level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Transparency Directive. The aim of the Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and 
43

Table of Contents

reimbursement mechanisms established in the E.U. Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the E.U. and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual E.U. Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing nor reimbursement levels in individual E.U. Member States.
Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some E.U. Member States. These E.U. Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in European Economic Area, or EEA, countries is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual E.U. Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between E.U. Member States.
In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the EU. Pursuant to this Directive, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual E.U. Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between E.U. Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some E.U. Member States.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third party-payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, value assessment for cancer treatments
On May 31, 2016, ASCO published a framework to assess the value of cancer treatment options. The framework was developed in response to concern that new, expensive cancer treatments may not be supported by adequate medical evidence. The purpose of the framework is to provide a standardized quantification of cancer treatments and assist oncologists and patients in deciding between new cancer treatments and the standard of care. The framework takes into account a medication’s (i) efficacy, (ii) safety and (iii) cost, to derive an overall treatment value.
This framework is described by ASCO as providing a basis for a new software tool that doctors can use to assist shared decision-making with their patients. While we believe that the safety and efficacy profiles of our product candidates are potentially better than that of the standard of care and, if approved, we intend to price our products competitively, we do not know how the data will be assessed by ASCO. It is also unknown whether use of this application could adversely affect the assessment of any of our product candidates. If this framework and software were adopted and utilized by payors and physicians, and if our product candidates were to receive low ratings, this could adversely affect the price and reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, reduce prescriptions and harm our business.
Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we 
44

conduct our business. We have described below some of the key federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, clarified that liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes ‘‘any request or demand’’ for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal civil False Claims Act for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, a claim can be deemed to be false due to failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements material to the government’s payment decision. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $10,781 to $21,563 per false claim or statement for violations occurring after November 2, 2015. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to have started tracking such payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
Many states have adopted analogous laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs; file periodic reports with the state, including reports on gifts and payments to individual health care providers; make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities; and/or register their sales representatives. Some states prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing. Some states prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices, including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers, and/or offering co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no 
45

place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Other jurisdictions, including Canada, have corresponding laws and regulations governing the handling of personal information and third party communications that may be more or less stringent than those of the United States. In Canada, such laws include the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, similar provincial legislation regarding privacy and personal health information and anti-spam legislation, wherein the failure to comply or breaches can result in notification requirements or corrective action, including civil and criminal fines and sanctions.
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual United States Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
If we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we will have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid drug rebate program, and we may have obligations to report average sales price, or ASP, figures to the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include average manufacturer price, or AMP and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions.
Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid drug rebate program report ASP information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B and the resulting Medicare payment rate.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid drug rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its “covered drugs” (biologics or innovator drugs) available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, that is no higher than the statutory federal ceiling price. The requirements under the 340B and FSS programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Pricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. The Medicaid rebate amount for each manufacturer is computed each quarter based on the manufacturer’s submission to CMS of its current AMP and, in the case of 
46

Table of Contents

innovator products, best price figures, for the quarter. If we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program and become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed, we will be obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due. Such restatements and recalculations would increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid drug rebate program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we would be required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the 340B drug discount program.
If we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program or our products are covered under Medicare Part B, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP, ASP, or best price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP, ASP, and best price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we would participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for our covered outpatient drugs that we are able to successfully commercialize.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private ‘‘qui tam’’ actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
In the E.U., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual E.U. Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the E.U. Member States. One example is the UK Bribery Act 2010. This act applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
The national laws of certain E.U. Member States require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed. Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual E.U. Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual E.U. Member States.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Environmental and safety laws
We are subject to a variety of federal, provincial and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. Our operations involve such 
47

Table of Contents

hazardous materials and produce such hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal, provincial and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. Radioactive materials in Canada come under federal jurisdiction. Canada’s Nuclear Safety and Control Act 1997 c.9 contains a general prohibition against any activity, including possession of radioactive material, except in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The Nuclear Substances and Radiation Devices Regulation does however, exempt licensing requirements for small quantities of radioactive substances that either meet concentrations set out in a schedule to the Regulation or, for radioactive substances not set out in the schedule, that meet certain regulatory criteria. Our operations do not currently require a federal license issued by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Our operations in Canada may be subject to license approvals, notification requirements and investigation and enforcement for air and water and waste matters.
Corporate History - Acquisition of Viventia
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2008. We were formerly known as Denovo Therapeutics, Inc. and Newco LS14, Inc. before changing our name to Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 245 First Street, Suite 1800, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, and our telephone number is (617) 444-8550. 
On September 20, 2016, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Viventia, the shareholders of Viventia named therein - collectively referred to herein as the Selling Shareholders - and, solely in its capacity as seller representative, Clairmark, an affiliate of Leslie Dan, one of our directors, pursuant to which we agreed to and simultaneously completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Viventia from the Selling Shareholders, referred to herein as the Acquisition. In connection with the closing of the Acquisition, we issued 4,013,431 shares of our common stock to the Selling Shareholders according to their pro rata share of Viventia’s then-outstanding shares of common stock, which represented approximately 19.9% of our voting power as of immediately prior to the issuance of such shares of common stock.
In connection with the Acquisition, we are obligated to pay to the sellers certain post-closing contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified milestones and based upon net sales, in each case subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement, including: (i) a one-time milestone payment of $12.5 million payable upon the first sale of Vicinium or any variant or derivative thereof, other than Proxinium (referred to herein as the "Purchased Product"), in the United States; (ii) a one-time milestone payment of $7.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in any one of certain specified European countries; (iii) a one-time milestone payment of $3.0 million payable upon the first sale of the Purchased Product in Japan; and (iv) and quarterly earn-out payments equal to two percent (2%) of net sales of the Purchased Product during specified earn-out periods. Such earn-out payments are payable with respect to net sales in a country beginning on the date of the first sale in such country and ending on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2033 and (ii) fifteen years after the date of such sale, subject to early termination in certain circumstances if a biosimilar product is on the market in the applicable country. 
Under the Share Purchase Agreement, we, our affiliates, licensees and subcontractors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts, for the first seven years following the closing of the Acquisition, to achieve marketing authorizations throughout the world and, during the applicable earn-out period, to commercialize the Purchased Product in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Japan, China and Canada.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 17 full-time employees and no part-time employees, six hold Ph.D. degrees and one is a medical doctor. This number consists of two employees engaged in administration, six employees engaged in clinical activities, three employees engaged in research and development, three employees engaged in operations (two in manufacturing and one in facility/engineering) and three employees engaged in quality and support. Three of our employees are located in our corporate headquarters in Boston, 11 of our employees are located in our Winnipeg facility, and three of our employees are located in our Philadelphia office. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
