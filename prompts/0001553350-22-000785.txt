BACKGROUND
 
In February 2021 Okmin entered into a Joint Venture Agreement and Operating Agreement committing $100,000 in the initial phase to acquire working interests in ten oil and gas leases located in Okmulgee and Muskogee Counties in Oklahoma. Under the Operating Agreement, Okmin had a 50% Working Interest in 710 acres and a 25% interest in 80 acres. The Company’s Joint Venture partner, Blackrock Energy LLC (“Blackrock”) is the Operator of the project. Pursuant to a further agreement entered into on June 10, 2022, the Company added an additional five oil and gas leases across 739 acres to its joint venture with Blackrock, thereby expanding the overall project to fifteen leases covering over 1,500 acres.
 
In July 2021, the Company through its wholly owned Kansas subsidiary, Okmin Operations, LLC entered into an agreement to acquire a 72.5% Net Revenue Interest in the Vitt Lease located in Neosho County, Kansas. Okmin Operations, LLC acquired the lease with a cash payment of $25,000 together with a commitment to make additional expenditures to rework the wells on the lease. The lease covers 160 acres and currently includes eleven existing oil and gas wells and four water injection wells.
 
In August 2021, the Company entered into an option agreement with Blackrock to acquire a 50% joint venture interest in the West Sheppard Pool Field, a series of leases totaling 1,930 acres located in Okmulgee County, Oklahoma. In November 2021, the Company exercised its option and entered into a definitive joint venture and operating agreement with Blackrock at a cost of $150,000 in cash. The 24 existing wells on the leases range from 850 feet to 1,950 feet in depth with gas production from several zones as their main objective.
 
In December 2021, the Company exercised its option and entered into a definitive joint venture and operating agreement with Blackrock to acquire 50% of Blackrock’s interest in the Pushmataha Gas Field, comprising 6 leases covering an area of 3,840 acres located in Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. Blackrock had previously entered into a separate option to acquire working interests ranging from 92%-100% in the existing wells and lease acreage from a third party. In connection with the initial acquisition, the Company expended approximately $253,000 in cash.
 
Subject to the Company being able to secure adequate additional financing, Okmin may also acquire the rights to and participate in drilling and/or other mining operations. The Company will evaluate exploration and mining opportunities and other strategic corporate opportunities as they become available from time to time.

In the 2023 fiscal year we anticipate cash needs of a minimum of $550,000, of which we attribute approximately $250,000 to maintain general corporate overhead and $300,000 for continued work on our existing lease properties including but not limited to workovers and re-activations of existing non-producing wells. Based on the Company’s cash position as of June 30, 2022, additional financing will be required to meet its budgeted expenditures for fiscal 2023. Management intends to raise such additional financing through private sales of the Company’s securities, but no assurance can be given that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all.
