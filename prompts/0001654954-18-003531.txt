 Going Concern
 
Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  These factors include the following:
 
   ● 
 Final GEL Arbitration Award – As previously disclosed, LE was involved in arbitration proceedings (the “GEL Arbitration”) with GEL Tex Marketing, LLC (“GEL”), an affiliate of Genesis Energy, LP (“Genesis”), related to a contractual dispute involving a Crude Oil Supply and Throughput Services Agreement (the “Crude Supply Agreement”) and a Joint Marketing Agreement (the “Joint Marketing Agreement”), each between LE and GEL and dated August 12, 2011.  On August 11, 2017, the arbitrator delivered its final award in the GEL Arbitration (the “Final Arbitration Award”).  The Final Arbitration Award denied all LE’s claims against GEL and granted substantially all the relief requested by GEL in its counterclaims.  Among other matters, the Final Arbitration Award awarded damages and GEL’s attorneys’ fees and related expenses to GEL in the aggregate amount of approximately $31.3 million.


As previously disclosed, a hearing on confirmation of the Final Arbitration Award was scheduled to occur on September 18, 2017 in state district court in Harris County, Texas. Prior to the scheduled hearing, LE and GEL jointly notified the court that the hearing would be continued for a period of no more than 90 days after September 18, 2017 (the “Continuance Period”), to facilitate settlement discussions between the parties. On September 26, 2017, LE and Blue Dolphin, together with LEH and Jonathan Carroll, entered into a Letter Agreement with GEL, effective September 18, 2017 (the “GEL Letter Agreement”), confirming the parties’ agreement to the continuation of the confirmation hearing during the Continuance Period, subject to the terms of the GEL Letter Agreement.
 
The GEL Letter Agreement has been amended to extend the Continuance Period through April 30, 2018.  The GEL Letter Agreement, as amended to date, prohibits Blue Dolphin and its affiliates from making any pre-payments on indebtedness, other than in the ordinary course of business as described in the GEL Letter Agreement, and from making any payments to Jonathan Carroll under the Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements between November 1, 2017 and the end of the Continuance Period.  (Jonathan Carroll has received no cash payments since August 2016 and no common stock payments since May 2017 under the Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements.)  If the parties are unable to reach an acceptable settlement with Genesis and GEL, and GEL seeks to confirm and enforce the Final Arbitration Award against LE, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially affected, and LE would likely be required to seek protection under bankruptcy laws.
 
   ● 
 Veritex Secured Loan Agreement Event of Default – Veritex Community Bank (“Veritex”), as successor in interest to Sovereign Bank by merger, delivered to obligors notices of default under secured loan agreements with Veritex, stating that the Final Arbitration Award constitutes an event of default under the secured loan agreements.  The occurrence of an event of default permits Veritex to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available.  Veritex informed obligors that it is not currently exercising its rights and remedies under the secured loan agreements considering the ongoing settlement discussions with GEL and the continuance of the hearing on confirmation of the Final Arbitration Award and to allow Veritex to evaluate any proposed settlement agreement related to the Final Arbitration Award, which would require Veritex’s approval. However, Veritex expressly reserved all its rights, privileges and remedies related to events of default under the secured loan agreements and informed obligors that it would consider a final confirmation of the Final Arbitration Award to be a material event of default under the loan agreements. Any exercise by Veritex of its rights and remedies under the secured loan agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and would likely require us to seek protection under bankruptcy laws. The debt associated with loans under secured loan agreements was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 due to existing events of default related to the Final Arbitration Award as well as the uncertainty of LE and LRM’s ability to meet financial covenants in the secured loan agreements in the future.


We are currently evaluating the effects of the Final Arbitration Award on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  In addition to the matters described above, the Final Arbitration Award could materially and adversely affect our ability to procure adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate or our relationships with our customers.  The contract-related dispute has negatively affected our customer relationships, prevented us from taking advantage of business opportunities, disrupted refinery operations, diverted management’s focus away from running the business, and impacted our ability to obtain financing.

----------------------------+-------------------



We can provide no assurance as to whether negotiations with GEL will result in a settlement, the potential terms of any such settlement, or whether Veritex would approve any such settlement.  If LE is unable to reach an acceptable settlement with GEL or Veritex does not approve any such settlement and GEL seeks to confirm and enforce the Final Arbitration Award, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected and LE would likely be required to seek protection under bankruptcy laws.
 
 Operating Risks
 
Successful execution of our business plan depends on several key factors, including reaching an acceptable settlement with GEL, having adequate crude oil and condensate supplies, , maintaining the safe and reliable operation of the Nixon Facility, improving margins on refined petroleum products, and meeting contractual obligations. (See “Business Strategies” within this Part I, Item 1. Business for information related to our business plan.)  For the year ended December 31, 2017, execution of our business plan was negatively impacted by several factors, including:
 
   ● 
 Net Losses – For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $22,328,390, or a loss of $2.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $15,767,448, or a loss of $1.51 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The $0.58 per share increase in net loss between the periods was the result of the Final Arbitration Award, which was partially offset by improved margins for refined petroleum products and increased sales volume. The amount expensed in the period related to the Final Arbitration Award was $24,338,628, which represented $2.28 per share.  Excluding the Final Arbitration Award, we would have reported net income of $0.19 per share.


   ● 
 Working Capital Deficits – We had a working capital deficit of $69,512,829 at December 31, 2017 compared to a working capital deficit of $37,812,263 at December 31, 2016. Excluding long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $29,968,427 at December 31, 2017, compared to working capital of $5,599,927 at December 31, 2016. The significant increase in working capital deficit between the periods primarily related to the Final Arbitration Award and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents.


   ● 
 Crude Supply Issues – We currently have in place a month-to-month evergreen crude supply contract with a major integrated oil and gas company. This supplier currently provides us with adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate, and we expect the supplier to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  However, our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate is dependent on our liquidity and access to capital, which have been adversely affected by the contract-related dispute with GEL and other factors, as noted above.  The Final Arbitration Award could have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate from our current supplier or otherwise.


   ● 
 Financial Covenant Defaults – In addition to existing events of default related to the Final Arbitration Award, at December 31, 2017, LE and LRM were in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Veritex. Covenant defaults under the secured loan agreements would permit Veritex to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing obligors’ obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. The debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 due to existing events of default related to the Final Arbitration Award as well as the uncertainty of LE and LRM’s ability to meet the financial covenants in the future. There can be no assurance that Veritex will provide a waiver of events of default related to the Final Arbitration Award, consent to any proposed settlement with GEL or provide future waivers of any financial covenant defaults, which may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.

----------------------------+-------------------



During the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued aggressive actions to improve operations and liquidity.  We began selling certain of our refined petroleum products immediately following production, which minimizes inventory, improves cash flow, and reduces commodity risk/exposure. We completed construction on several new petroleum storage tanks at the Nixon Facility. Increased petroleum storage capacity: (i) assists with de-bottlenecking the facility, (ii) supports increased refinery throughput up to approximately 30,000 bpd, and (iii) provides an opportunity to generate additional tank rental revenue by leasing to third-parties. We also reduced our working capital requirements in a rising cost environment by decreasing costs, reducing inventory levels, improving our sales cycle, and requiring pre-payments from certain customers.  Management believes that it is taking the appropriate steps to improve operations at the Nixon Facility and our overall financial stability.  However, there can be no assurance that our business plan will be successful, LEH and its affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs, or that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.  Among other factors, the Final Arbitration Award could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan.

 Refining Industry Overview
 
Crude oil refining is the process of separating the hydrocarbons present in crude oil into usable or refined petroleum products such as naphtha, diesel, jet fuel and other products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business where both crude oil and refined petroleum products are commodities with prices that can fluctuate independently for short periods due to supply, demand, transportation and other factors. To increase profitability, or improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of higher value petroleum products and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. There are also several operational efficiencies that can be deployed to improve margins. These include selecting the appropriate crude oil or condensate to fulfill anticipated product demand, increasing the amount and value of refined petroleum products processed from the crude oil or condensate, reducing downtime for maintenance, repair and investment, developing valuable by-products or production inputs out of materials that are typically discarded, and adjusting utilization rates.
 
A refinery's product slate depends on the refinery's configuration and the type of crude oil and/or condensate being refined, and can be adjusted based on market demand. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil generally results in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, typically there is a time lag between the comparable increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on a refinery’s results of operations depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum products prices adjust to reflect these changes.

 Refinery Operations
 
Nixon Facility
 
The Nixon Facility is comprised of assets owned by LE and LRM.  LE owns the land, crude oil distillation unit, certain refined petroleum product storage tanks and related piping, and loading and unloading facilities and utilities.  LRM owns the naphtha stabilizer and depropanizer units, as well as certain petroleum product storage tanks and related piping.  Together, LE and LRM own more than 1,000,000 bbls of crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity at the Nixon Facility. Since 2015, the Nixon Facility has been undergoing a capital improvement expansion project to construct over 800,000 bbls of petroleum storage tankage.  Increased petroleum storage capacity: (i) assists with de-bottlenecking the facility, (ii) supports increased refinery throughput up to approximately 30,000 bpd, and (iii) provides an opportunity to generate additional tank rental revenue by leasing to third-parties.  The Nixon Facility is pledged as collateral under certain of our long-term debt as discussed in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (10) Long-Term Debt, Net”.
 
A regional electric cooperative supplies electrical power to the Nixon Facility. Fuel gas that is produced at the Nixon Facility is primarily used as fuel within the refinery.  In addition, small amounts of propane are occasionally acquired for use in starting-up the Nixon Facility.
 
Nixon Facility Process Summary
 
The Nixon Facility is considered a “topping unit” because it is primarily comprised of a crude oil distillation unit, the first stage of the crude oil refining process. The Nixon Facility’s current level of complexity allows crude oil and condensate to be refined into finished and intermediate petroleum products.  The below diagram represents a high-level overview of the current crude oil and condensate refining process at the Nixon Facility.
 

 Example represents a simplified plant configuration.  The specific configuration will vary based on various market and operational factors.

----------------------------+-------------------

Turnaround and Refinery Reliability
 
We are committed to the safe and efficient operation of the Nixon Facility.  Turnarounds are used to repair, restore, refurbish or replace refinery equipment such as vessels, tanks, reactors, piping, rotating equipment, instrumentation, electrical equipment, heat exchangers and fired heaters.  Typically, a refinery undergoes a major facility turnaround every three to five years.  Since the Nixon Facility is still in the recommissioning phase, one or more of the units may require additional unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds.
 Crude Oil and Condensate Supply
 
Operation of the Nixon Facility depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate on favorable terms.  We currently have in place a month-to-month evergreen crude supply contract with a major integrated oil and gas company.  This supplier currently provides us with adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate, and we expect the supplier to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.  However, our ability to purchase crude oil and condensate is dependent on our liquidity and access to capital, which have been adversely affected by net losses, working capital deficits, the contract-related dispute with GEL, and financial covenant defaults in secured loan agreements.
 
Management believes that it is taking the appropriate steps to improve operations at the Nixon Facility and our overall financial stability.  If our business plan is unsuccessful, it could affect our ability to acquire adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate under the existing contract or otherwise.  Among other factors, the Final Arbitration Award could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate from our current supplier or otherwise.  Further, because our existing crude supply contract is a month-to-month arrangement, there can be no assurance that crude oil and condensate supplies will continue to be available under this contract in the future.
 
 Products and Markets
 
Products
 
The Nixon Facility’s product slate can be moderately adjusted based on market demand. We currently produce a single finished product – jet fuel. We produce several intermediate products, including naphtha, HOBM, and AGO.
Markets
 
The Nixon Facility is in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which is represented by the Energy Information Administration as Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3 (“PADD 3”).  Our products are primarily sold in the U.S. within PADD 3.  However, with the opening of the Mexican refined products market to private companies, we occasionally sell refined products to customers that export to Mexico. LEH, which is HUBZone certified, purchases our jet fuel and resells the jet fuel to a government agency.  Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing.  (See “Part I, Item 1. Business – Management” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (8) Related Party Transactions, Note (10) Long-Term Debt, Net, and Note (19) Commitments and Contingencies – Financing Agreements” for additional disclosures related to LEH.)
Customers
 
Customers for our refined petroleum products include distributors, wholesalers and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms, in place with most of our customers. Certain of our contracts require us to sell fixed quantities and/or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products and many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation, which could result in higher or lower relative prices for our refined petroleum products. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (14) Concentration of Risk” of this Annual Report for disclosures related to significant customers.

----------------------------+-------------------

Competition
 
Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and are engaged on a national or international basis in many segments of the petroleum products business, including exploration and production, refining, transportation and marketing. These competitors may have greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes occurring in one or more of these business segments. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined petroleum products slate because of changing commodity prices, market demand, and refinery operating costs.
 Business Strategy
 
Our overall business strategy is to improve operations, increase refinery throughput, improve refining margins, and continue the safe and reliable operation of the Nixon Facility.  Successful execution of our business strategy depends on several key factors, including reaching an acceptable settlement with GEL, having adequate crude oil and condensate supplies and continuing to meet contractual obligations.
Nixon Facility Capital and Efficiency Improvements
 
In 2015, LE and LRM secured $35.0 million in the aggregate in 19-year financing to expand the Nixon Facility. Since 2015, the Nixon Facility has been undergoing a capital improvement expansion project to construct over 800,000 bbls of petroleum storage tankage. At December 31, 2017, the refinery had more than 1,000,000 bbls of crude oil, condensate, and refined petroleum product storage capacity in 27 tanks. Overall improvements at the Nixon Facility will position us for long-term growth by: (i) having crude and product storage to support refinery throughput and future expansion of up to 30,000 bpd; (ii) increasing the processing capacity and complexity of the Nixon Facility for expanded refined product opportunities; and (iii) generating additional revenue from leasing product and crude storage to third parties.  Capital expenditures at the Nixon Facility are being funded primarily through borrowings under credit bank facilities that were secured in 2015.
 
See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (10) Long-Term Debt, Net” for additional disclosures related to borrowings for capital spending.
 
Improved Financial Stability
 
As noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, we began selling certain of our refined petroleum products immediately following production, which minimizes inventory, improves cash flow, and reduces commodity risk/exposure.  We also reduced our working capital requirements in a rising cost environment by decreasing costs, reducing inventory levels, improving our sales cycle, and receiving pre-payments from certain customers.  Management believes that these efforts, combined with favorable margins, will improve operations and liquidity.  (See “Part I, Item 1. Business – Going Concern” for certain factors that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.)
 Pipeline Transportation
 
Our pipeline transportation operations involve the gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas for producers/shippers operating offshore near our pipelines, as well as leasehold interests in oil and natural gas properties, in the Gulf of Mexico. We derived no revenue from our Pipeline Transportation operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Our pipeline transportation operations represented less than 1% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
We fully impaired our pipeline assets at December 31, 2016. All pipeline transportation services to third-parties have ceased, existing third-party wells along our pipeline corridor are being permanently abandoned, and no new third-party wells are being drilled near our pipelines. However, management believes our pipeline assets have future value based on large-scale, third-party production facility expansion projects near the pipelines. Our oil and gas properties had no production during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All leases associated with our oil and gas properties have expired, and our oil and gas properties were fully impaired in 2011.

----------------------------+-------------------

 Acquisition, Disposition and Restructuring Activities
 
We regularly engage in discussions with third-parties regarding the possible purchase of assets and operations that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. However, we do not anticipate any material acquisition activity in the foreseeable future.
 
In 2013, the Board established a Master Limited Partnership (“MLP”) Conversion Special Committee to oversee a potential conversion of Blue Dolphin from a Delaware “C” corporation to a Delaware MLP. Due to a shift in market conditions over the past three years, the MLP Conversion Special Committee was dissolved in March 2018.
 
 Insurance and Risk Management
 
Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in crude oil and condensate refining operations, as well as in the transportation and storage of crude oil and condensate and finished and intermediate petroleum products. We have property damage and business interruption coverage at the Nixon Facility. Business interruption coverage is for 24 months from the date of the loss, subject to a deductible with a 45-day waiting period. Our property damage insurance has deductibles ranging from $5,000 to $500,000. In addition, we have a full suite of insurance policies covering workers’ compensation, general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, environmental liability, and other business risks. These are supported by safety and other risk management programs. See also, “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business” in this Annual Report.
 Governmental Regulation
 
Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety statutes, regulations, and ordinances.  These rules govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and hazardous substances; the emission and discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection; waste management; characteristics and composition of diesel and other fuels; and the monitoring, reporting and control of greenhouse gas emissions. These laws impose costly obligations on our operations, including requiring the acquisition of permits and authorizations to conduct regulated activities, restricting the way regulated activities are conducted, limiting the quantities and types of materials that may be released into the environment, and requiring the monitoring of releases of materials into the environment.
 
Failure to comply with environmental, health or safety laws and our existing permits or other authorizations issued under such laws could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, injunctive relief compelling the installation of additional controls, a revocation of our permits, and/or the shutdown of our facilities.
 
We cannot predict the extent to which additional environmental, health, and safety laws will be enacted in the future, or how existing or future laws will be interpreted with respect to our operations. Many environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. The cost of compliance with and governmental enforcement of environmental, health, and safety laws may increase in the future. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures or incur increased operating costs to achieve or sustain compliance with applicable environmental, health, and safety laws.  This Governmental Regulation section should be read in conjunction with “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, which discusses our expectations regarding future events based on currently available information.
 
Air Emissions
 
Toxic Air Pollutants.  The federal Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) is a comprehensive law that regulates toxic air pollutants from stationary and mobile sources. Among other things, the law authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) to establish National Ambient Air Quality Standards to protect public health and public welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The CAA, as well as corresponding state laws and regulations regarding emissions of pollutants into the air, affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations and impact certain emissions sources located offshore. Under the CAA, facilities that emit volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) or nitrogen oxides face increasingly stringent regulations.
 
  

14

 
 
BLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY | FORM 10-K 12/31/17
----------------------------+-------------------



Refineries, which are major stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants, have historically been high-visibility targets for enforcement by the EPA under the CAA.  Petroleum refineries are subject to the EPA’s National Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. These standards require petroleum refineries to meet emission standards reflecting the application of the maximum achievable control technology. The affected sources at petroleum refineries are defined to include all process vents, storage vessels, marine tank vessel loading operations, gasoline rack operations, equipment leaks, and wastewater treatment systems located at the refinery.  To meet emission standards, we are required to obtain permits, as well as test, monitor, report, and implement control requirements.
 
Under the EPA’s Mobile Source Air Toxics regulations most refineries are required to produce transportation fuels for highway use at or below 15 ppm sulfur for “on-road” and “off-road” diesel and 30 ppm sulfur for gasoline. The Nixon Facility does not produce gasoline, and the facility ceased production of nonroad, locomotive, and marine, a transportation-related diesel fuel product in 2014 – when the new regulations took effect.  Since 2014, the Nixon Facility has produced HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product.  “Topping units,” like the Nixon Facility, typically lack a desulfurization process unit to lower sulfur content levels within the range required by the EPA’s sulfur control standards, and integration of such a desulfurization unit generally requires additional permitting and significant capital upgrades. We can produce and sell diesel with sulfur content levels above the EPA’s sulfur control standards: (i) in the U.S. as a feedstock to other refineries and blenders and (ii) to other countries as a finished petroleum product.
 
The EPA issued three (3) final rules to cut emissions of methane from the oil and gas industry.  These final rules curb emissions of methane, VOC’s, and air toxics from new, reconstructed and modified oil and gas sources, while providing greater certainty about CAA permitting requirements for the industry.  The EPA also issued an Information Collection Request (“ICR”) to operators in the oil and natural gas industry to obtain extensive information for developing regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. In March 2017, the EPA withdrew the ICR request, effectively immediately.  As a result, responses to the ICR were no longer required.
 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Emission of Greenhouse Gases (“GHGs”) is regulated by the EPA under the CAA. By allowing the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, the EPA’s findings also indirectly impacted many other carbon-intensive industries, which would potentially become subject to federal New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting requirements under the CAA (the “CAA Permitting Requirements”). 
 
The EPA established GHG emissions thresholds to define when permits under the CAA Permitting Requirements are required for new and existing industrial facilities (the “Tailoring Rule”). Emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all but the very largest commercial facilities are not covered by the Tailoring Rule. The Tailoring Rule established a schedule that: (i) initially focused on the largest stationary sources with the most CAA permitting experience, (ii) then expanded to cover the largest stationary sources of GHG that may not have been previously covered by the CAA for other pollutants, and (iii) finally described the EPA’s plan for any additional steps in this process. Without this tailoring rule, the lower emissions thresholds would have taken effect automatically for GHGs in 2011, leading to dramatic increases in the number of required permits. The EPA implemented the Tailoring Rule in phases.
 
In 2016, the EPA updated New Source Performance Standards by setting emission limits for methane, covering additional sources, such as hydraulically fractured oil wells, and requiring owners/operators to find and repair leaks.  The EPA also updated the Source Determination rules to clarify when multiple pieces of equipment and activities must be deemed a single source when determining whether major source permitting programs apply.
 
Although we are not currently subject to reporting requirements under GHG-related regulations, the future adoption of any regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from the Nixon Facility could require us to incur significant costs and expenses or changes in operations, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
 
Renewable Fuels
 
Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA issued Renewable Fuels Standards (“RFS”) that require the blending of biofuels into transportation fuel. Since the compliance mechanism for RFS - Renewable Identification Numbers – would have created a burden on the Nixon Facility related to its nonroad, locomotive, and marine production through 2014, LE applied for an extension of the temporary exemption afforded small refineries through December 31, 2010 under the CAA Section 211(o)(9)(B).  The EPA granted the Nixon Facility a small refinery exemption from RFS requirements for 2013 and 2014.  In 2014, the Nixon Facility began producing HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product that does not fall under RFS.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on responsible parties with uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites, as well as accidents, spills, and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment. The law authorizes two kinds of response actions: (i) short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response, and (ii) long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. As of the filing of this Annual Report, neither we nor any of our predecessors have been designated as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state and local laws impose requirements related to the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Our refining operations generate petroleum product wastes, solid wastes, and ordinary industrial wastes, such as from paint and solvents, that are regulated under RCRA and state law. Certain wastes generated by the Nixon Facility are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes, but are subject to non-hazardous waste regulations. In the future, these wastes could be designated as hazardous wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes and therefore may become subject to more rigorous and costly requirements.
 
The Nixon Facility has been used for refining activities for many years. Although prior owners and operators may have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and various wastes may have been released on or under the Nixon Facility site. A 2008 third-party environmental study determined that petroleum hydrocarbon and VOC concentrations were below Tier 1 protective concentration levels (“PCLs”).  However, RCRA-8 metals were found to be above Tier 1 PCLs.  An additional third-party study determined that metal concentrations from the soil would not leach beyond groundwater concentrations exceeding their respective PCLs.  As a result, groundwater resources were not threatened, and no further reporting was required.
 
Water Discharges
 
Stormwater from the Nixon Facility is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable stormwater permits.  Process wastewater from the Nixon Facility is tested and discharged to a nearby municipal treatment facility pursuant to applicable process wastewater permits. Wastewater from our offshore facilities, including our oil and natural gas pipelines and anchor platform, are tested and discharged pursuant to applicable produced water permits.
Spill Prevention and Control
 
The Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and stringent controls on the discharge of pollutants, including oil, into federal and state waters. These laws affect our crude oil and condensate processing operations and petroleum storage and terminaling operations, as well as our pipeline, facilities, and exploration and production assets. The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters except as authorized by the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency with delegated authority. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements mandate the use of structures, such as berms and other secondary containment, to prevent hydrocarbons or other pollutants from reaching a jurisdictional body of water in the event of a spill or leak. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA or analogous state laws and regulations.
 
The EPA covers inland oil spills. In 2015, the EPA published a final rule expanding the definition of “Waters of the United States” under the CWA.  Waters that are specifically excluded from the EPA’s jurisdiction include, among others, depressions incidental to mining or construction that may become filled with water, puddles, groundwater, and stormwater control features constructed to convey, treat, or store stormwater on dry land. See “Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight” within this governmental regulation section for information on oil spills that occur in coastal waters.

Offshore Safety and Environmental Oversight
 
In addition to the CAA, our pipeline, exploration and production assets are also subject to the requirements of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (the “OCSLA”). The OCSLA is administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the “BSEE”) and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The BSEE has partnered with the U.S. Coast Guard for oil spill response. The BOEM and the BSEE have been more aggressive in proposing and implementing several reforms to offshore oil and gas regulations.
 
Spill Liability.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “OPA”) and the CWA, combined with the OCSLA, impose liability on owners or operators of vessels and facilities that discharge oil into the navigable waters of the U.S., adjoining shorelines, waters of the contiguous zone, or when the discharge may affect natural resources of the U.S. With limited exceptions, responsible parties are liable for all removal costs and damages arising from oil spills.  Damages may include: injury or economic losses resulting from destruction of real or personal property, damages or loss of use of natural resources used for subsistence, lost tax revenue, royalties, rents, or net profit shares suffered by federal, state, or local governments due to injury to real or personal property, lost profits or impaired earning power because of injury to real or personal property or natural resources, and the net costs of providing increased or additional public services during or after removal activities.
 
The BOEM has increased the offshore limit of liability for damages under the OPA from $75 million to $133.65 million, plus all clean-up costs, to reflect the significant increase in the Consumer Price Index.  The onshore facilities limit of liability for damages under the OPA is $350 million plus all clean-up costs.  A party cannot take advantage of the liability limits if the spill is caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from a violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. If a party fails to report a spill or cooperate in the clean-up, liability limits do not apply.  The OPA requires responsible parties to provide proof of financial responsibility for potential spills. The amount required for certain types of offshore facilities located seaward of the seaward boundary of a state, including properties used for oil transportation, is $35 million. BDPL currently maintains the statutory $35 million coverage.
 
Spill Response.  Pursuant to the OPA, the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan, provides a blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases.  The National Contingency Plan requires, among other things, that responsible parties have an oil spill response plan in place. We have an oil spill response plan in place.
 
Decommissioning Requirements.  To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the BOEM generally requires that lessees and rights-of-way holders demonstrate financial strength and reliability per regulations or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied, unless the BOEM exempts the lessee or rights-of-way holder from such financial assurance requirements.  Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by the BOEM.
 
Under a newer financial assurance program model, the BOEM no longer: (i) grants waivers from additional security obligations and (ii) considers the combined strength and reliability of co-lessees when determining a lessee’s additional security requirements.  Also, provided guidance and clarification regarding submission of certified decommissioning cost expenditure summaries following permanent plugging of any well, removal of any platform or other facility, and clearance of any site.
 
The BOEM requested that BDPL provide additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance of approximately $4.6 million related to five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-way. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, BDPL maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM.  Of the five (5) existing pipeline rights-of-ways related to BOEM’s request, the pipeline associated with one (1) right-of-way was decommissioned in 1997. The BSEE approved BDPL permit requests to decommission in place the pipelines for three (3) of these rights-of-way.  As a result, management is seeking a reduction in the amount of BOEM’s request for additional financial assurance.  There can be no assurance that the BOEM will accept a reduced amount of supplemental financial assurance or not require additional supplemental pipeline bonds related to our existing pipeline rights-of-way.  If BDPL is required by the BOEM to provide significant additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance, we may experience a significant and material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition.

Offshore Safety.  Under the Workplace Safety Rule, BSEE requires operators to employ a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (“SEMS”).  SEMS and a subsequent revision to SEMS (“SEMS II”) reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work-related accidents and offshore spills, develop protocols as to who at the facility has the ultimate operational safety and decision-making authority, and establish procedures to provide all personnel with “stop work” authority. SEMS II must be periodically audited by an independent third-party auditor approved by the BSEE.  BDPL has a SEMS II plan in place.
 
Health, Safety and Maintenance
 
We are subject to several federal and state laws and regulations related to the health and safety of workers pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. These laws and regulations are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the “OSHA”) and, in states not participating in OSHA-approved state safety plans, comparable state regulatory bodies.
 
Our refinery operations are also subject to OSHA process safety management regulations and the National Emphasis Program for Petroleum Refineries (the “RNEP”).  RNEP requires refineries to be inspected for compliance with process safety management regulations. Inspections may last from two to six months, including one to three months onsite. Inspectors primarily focus on process safety management implementation and recordkeeping. The Nixon Facility was inspected by OSHA in 2013 and again in June 2016.  Following the 2013 inspection, LE was assessed a civil penalty of $38,500. Following the 2016 inspection, LE was assessed a civil penalty of $6,006.  Citations issued by OSHA primarily related to failure to comply with documentation and notice posting requirements.
 
We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by personnel at all levels of the organization. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely monitor our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
