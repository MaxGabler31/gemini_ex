ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview:
 
Capital Park Holdings Corp., which we refer to as “the Company,” “our Company,” “we,” “us” or “our,” commenced its current business operations in January 2019. Previously, our name was LifeLogger Technologies Corp., which was incorporated in Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the original name Snap Online Marketing Inc. The Company converted to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Capital Park Holdings Corp. effective April 10, 2019.
 
The Company is structured as a holding company with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business.
 
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
 
Our operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis with there essentially being no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and there is minimal involvement by the Company’s corporate headquarters in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. The Company’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. It also is responsible for establishing and monitoring our corporate governance practices, monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed.
 
The Company’s activities are managed by a small company staff that seeks out attractive investment opportunities; delegates responsibilities to competent and motivated managers; sets operating subsidiary goals; assists managers in the achievement of those goals; defines risk parameters and appropriate incentive schemes and monitors progress against long-term objectives.
 
We believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many stakeholders in potential control transactions may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that securities or whole businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term corporate objectives of increasing shareholder value.
 
Our objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management’s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return.
 
Our Strategy
 
We will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at a discount to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company’s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns. We will target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles, and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence. We will largely target investments in businesses headquartered or with significant operations in North America.
 
We believe that an investment strategy focused on these industries with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value.
 
Management Strategy
 
Our management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we own in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn, to increase shareholder value. In general, we will oversee and support the management teams of each of our businesses by, among other things:

i. | recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business;

ii. | regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;

iii. | assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies; 
iv. | identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and 
v. | forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives. 

Investment Strategy
 
Our investment strategy centers around our ability to consistently seek to acquire securities and/or companies at a discount to intrinsic value as determined by various metrics, including without limitation, replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
 
We utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investing approach. This approach generally involves three (3) critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation, capital structure and security analysis; (ii) intense analysis of fulcrum issues, such as litigation, taxes and regulation, that often affect valuation; and (iii) a deep understanding and analysis of contextual factors that often affect the risk-adjusted attractiveness of an investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market price dislocations that create attractive buying opportunities. These dislocations may be caused by such factors as broad-based market drawdowns; busted auction processes; out of favor, short term industry perceptions; market euphoria; litigation; complex contingent liabilities; corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance; general bearish economic conditions; and / or complex and inappropriate capital structures.
 
While we will principally focus on deploying a material portion of our investable capital into acquiring controlling interests in privately held and/or thinly traded middle market operating businesses, we may employ a number of acquisition strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities including: (i) publicly traded equities; (ii) publicly traded bonds and privately issued, non-investment grade debt, bank debt and other corporate obligations; and (iii) privately issued and publicly traded structured equity and other preferred equity securities.
 
Business Strategy:
 
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
 
Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets. We intend to continue to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies/assets that experience busted sell-side auction processes, disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
 
Utilize a Low-Cost Model. We believe our low overhead model allows us to more effectively utilize excess cash flows from our portfolio of operating businesses and securities to enhance shareholder value through efficient capital allocation activities.
 
Internal Resources and External Network Sufficient to Drive Accretive Opportunities. We believe our internal management team and their strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us a strong pipeline of opportunities. Additionally, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.
 
Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our management team is accountable directly to our Board of Directors and has day-to-day responsibility for general oversight of our business and for capital allocation decisions of our operating businesses. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner’s perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we look for senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors.

Our Corporate History and Recent Developments
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as Snap Online Marketing Inc. on June 4, 2012 and subsequently changed our name to Lifelogger Technologies Corp., which we refer to as “Lifelogger.” On April 10, 2019, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and changed our name to Capital Park Holdings Corp. Our principal business address is 8117 Preston Road, Suite 300, Dallas, Texas 75225, and our telephone number is (972) 525-8546. We registered as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) on April 26, 2013. In 2014, we were listed for trading on the OTCQX under the trading symbol “LOGG.” Pursuant to the conversion of the Company to a Delaware corporation under a new name, as stated below, we anticipate registering a new trading symbol on the OTCQX.
 
On January 9, 2019, Capital Park Opportunities Fund LP, which we refer to as “Capital Park Opportunities Fund,” acquired (i) from SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability corporation (“SBI”) and Old Main Capital, LLC, a Florida series limited liability corporation (“Old Main,” together with SBI, the “Selling Shareholders”) 335,183 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) owned by the Selling Shareholders and (ii) from Stewart Garner (the “Series A Preferred Stock Holder”) 1,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), collectively representing 84.4% of the voting power of the Company’s voting stock. Capital Park Opportunities Fund is managed by Eric Blue, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Investment Officer (“CIO”).
 
On January 9, 2019, Eric C. Blue was elected as our sole director, CEO and CIO. On March 13, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Mike Kubic of The CFO Suite, LLC to be the Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
 
On April 10, 2019, we converted from a Nevada corporation to a Delaware corporation and adopted new bylaws and a new certificate of incorporation, which amended and restated the company’s Articles of Incorporation in Nevada. Under the new certificate of incorporation, we effected a 7:1 reverse stock split of our Class A common stock and created an additional series of our stock now named Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share. Each share of Class B common stock is identical to the Class A common stock in liquidation, dividend and similar rights. The only difference between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock is that each share of Class B common stock has 10 votes for each share held, while the Class A common stock has a single vote per share, and certain actions cannot be taken without the approval of the holders of the Class B common stock.
 
Corporate Structure
 
The Company is structured as a Delaware corporation that we expect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Your rights as a holder of shares, and the fiduciary duties of the Company’s Board of Directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto are set forth in the documents governing the Company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, the documents governing the Company specify that the duties of its directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation.
 
The Company’s Board of Directors will oversee the management of the Company and our businesses. Initially, the Company’s Board of Directors will be comprised of five (5) directors, with three (3) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class A common stock and two (2) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company’s Class B common stock, and at least three (3) of whom will be the Company’s independent directors.
