General
 
Evans & Sutherland focuses on the production of high-quality advanced visual display systems used primarily in full-dome video projection applications, dome projection screens, dome architectural treatments, and unique content for planetariums, schools, science centers, other educational institutions, and entertainment venues. With a 50-year history in computer graphics, we are widely regarded as both a pioneer and a leader in providing the world’s most compelling full-dome digital theater and planetarium systems as well as original full-dome shows. With our subsidiary, Spitz, Inc. (“Spitz”), and its over 70-year history as a leading supplier of planetarium systems, dome projection screens and other dome displays, E&S supplies premier total system solutions for its digital theater markets as well as customized domes and other unique geometric structures in the architectural market.
 
We continue to maintain a significant share of the overall planetarium market.  We estimate that the annual market for our planetarium products ranges from $65 million to $100 million and varies each year depending on the timing of customer projects. We estimate our share of the planetarium market has ranged from 30% to 50% each year.  Additionally we sell related products into tangential markets that are less defined which make up the balance of our revenue. 
 
Description of Products 
 E&S offers a range of products and services primarily for dome and planetarium theaters in educational institutions, training, and entertainment venues. These products include state of the art planetarium and dome theater systems consisting of proprietary hardware and software, and other unique visual display systems primarily used to project digital video on large curved surfaces. We also produce unique show content both for our own library which we license to customers and for specific customer requirements for planetarium and dome theaters.  Additionally, we manufacture and install metal domes with customized optical coatings and acoustical properties that are used for planetarium and dome theaters as well as many other unique custom applications. Our dome engineering and manufacturing resources also design and supply geometrically complex structures for customized architectural treatments, often involving curved metal shapes with unique optical and acoustical properties.
Description of Markets
 We are an industry leader in providing full-dome hardware and software to an international customer base in the digital theater, planetarium, entertainment, training and educational markets. In each of these markets, we face highly competitive conditions where we compete on features, performance, and responsiveness to customer needs as well as on price. E&S is unique among its competitors by virtue of its capability as a single source that can directly supply and integrate all of the equipment in the planetarium theater, including the projection system, sound, lighting, computer control system and domed projection screen. We believe our range of visual systems and services at various price and performance levels, our research and development investments and capabilities, our responsiveness to customers, and our ability to design and manufacture value-added visual systems enable us to compete effectively. Our competitive strengths with visual systems and services aid the sale of our dome projection

screens as customers often require a new dome projection screen with their visual system. We also believe our capabilities to design and manufacture domes and certain other architectural structures are very unique and enable us to compete effectively in all of the markets where these products are sold. 
Digital Theater
 In the digital theater market our products compete with traditional optical-mechanical products and digital display systems offered by GOTO Optical Mfg. Co., Konica-Minolta Planetarium Co. Ltd., Carl Zeiss Inc., and Sky-Skan, Inc. The Company’s digital display systems are configured with standard commercial projectors similar to systems sold by our competitors. Our proprietary Digistar full-dome digital system, along with other customized software tools differentiate our digital theater systems and compete favorably with competitive digital display systems. Our SciDome planetarium system, which uses a dome theater version of a retail desktop astronomy product with curriculum tools for teachers, creates a unique competitive advantage when targeting smaller classroom planetarium theaters. 
Advanced Displays
 Our capabilities and products sometimes are used for special advance display applications primarily for wide audiences in specialty theaters and other visitor attractions. This includes the integration of the most advanced video projectors with customized lenses, software and unique application techniques to serve customers who are in search of extraordinary display of visual content. Our competition in these markets includes various specialty audio visual systems integrators and alternative solutions using other technologies. 
Giant Screen Cinema
 E&S supplies digital display systems for educational and entertaining giant screen cinema experiences, focused on the market commonly defined by established competitors like IMAX. We bring unique capabilities and strengths to this market, including ultra-high resolution projection systems.
Domed Structures
 Our Spitz subsidiary is the world's leading producer of domed projection screens. At Spitz we design, manufacture, and install domed projection screens used in planetarium theaters and a variety of other applications such as ride simulators, special or large format film theaters, simulation training systems and architectural treatments. We have developed proprietary dome products such as our NanoSeam dome which we believe provides the smoothest, most uniform projection surface available. Our experience with dome projection screens enables us to advise on the architectural integration of domed projection screens and solve complex optical problems involving reflectivity and image distortion on compound curved surfaces. We believe that these skills are important to buyers of domed projection screens. The principal customers of our dome business are entities in the entertainment, educational and commercial and military simulation markets. Customers include major theme parks, casinos, world expositions, museums, schools, and military defense contractors. There is currently one known domestic competitor that manufactures domed projection screens. In addition, construction or metal fabrication contractors occasionally supply domed projection screens, particularly in foreign markets. The structures we design and supply for architectural treatments are sold as complements to our dome screen products or into the architectural market for a wide variety of interesting venues. Competition for our architectural treatment products usually comes from construction or metal fabrication contractors often with an alternative design idea. 
Intellectual Property
 
We own a significant number of patents and trademarks and we are a licensee under several others.  Our portfolio of patents and trademarks, as a whole, contributes to our business.  However, no one piece of intellectual property is critical to our business, thus no individual piece of our intellectual property is separately discussed.  In the U.S. and internationally, we hold active patents that cover many aspects of our visualization technology.  Several patent applications are presently pending and routinely other patent applications are in preparation. We actively pursue patents on our new technology and we intend to vigorously protect our patent rights.  We often trademark key product names and brand names to protect our equity in the marketplace. We routinely copyright software and documentation and institute copyright registration when appropriate. Currently we retain a total of 18 active U.S. patents.

Research and Development
 
We consider the timely development and improvement of our technology to be essential to maintain our competitive position and to capitalize on market opportunities.  We continue to fund essentially all research and development (“R&D”) efforts internally.  
 R&D efforts continue to improve Digistar, our popular full-dome digital system and a key component to our planetarium and dome theater products. We also explore the possibility of other commercial applications for Digistar technology as opportunities arise. We conduct ongoing R&D to improve the functionality of SciDome to keep pace with updated versions of the desktop software it emulates and to take advantage of the latest digital display and theater technology. Some noteworthy specific R&D activities for our advance display and planetarium products include the development of unique techniques to display three dimensional digital video and the expansion of educational curriculum tools to cover new subject matter in addition to astronomy such as chemistry and earth sciences. We continue to develop improvements to our dome products including optical coatings and ways to make the projection surface more uniform. There are also R&D efforts ongoing to enhance components of the systems we sell, such as improvements to theater lighting. 
 We continually work with the new digital projection technologies to develop advanced visual display systems primarily to be used by wide audiences in specialty theaters and other visitor attractions. This includes the integration of the most advanced video projectors with customized lenses, software and unique application techniques to serve customers who are in search of extraordinary display of visual content. 
 Dependence on Suppliers
 Most of our current parts and assemblies are readily available through multiple sources in the open market; however, a limited number are available only from a single source.  In these cases, we either stock adequate inventory to cover future product demands, obtain the agreement of the vendor to maintain adequate stock for future demands, or develop alternative components or sources where appropriate.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, Evans & Sutherland and its subsidiaries employed a total of 96 persons of which 95 were employed full time.  
 Environmental Standards
 We believe our facilities and operations are within standards fully acceptable to the Environmental Protection Agency and that all facilities and procedures are operated in accordance with environmental rules and regulations, and international, federal, state and local laws.
Strategic Relationships
 In the normal course of business, we develop and maintain various types of relationships with key customers and technology partners. The teaming agreements are with industry partners and are intended to improve our overall competitive position. The product development agreements enhance our products by the cooperative development of new features and capabilities necessary to maintain our industry leading position.
