Overview
Shutterstock is a global technology company that offers an e-commerce platform for high-quality digital content, tools and services to creative professionals. The digital content licensed by our customers includes: (a) imagery, consisting of licensed photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips that customers use in their visual communications, such as websites, digital and print marketing materials, corporate communications, books, publications and video content; and (b) music, consisting of high-quality music tracks and sound effects, which is often used to complement digital imagery. We also offer digital asset management services through Webdam, our cloud-based digital asset management service. Webdam provides tools for customers to better manage creative content and brand management assets. 
Our platform brings together users and contributors of creative content by providing a readily-searchable collection of content that our customers may pay to license and incorporate into their work and by compensating contributors as their content is licensed to our customers. For customers seeking specialized content, we also create custom, on-brand content through our platform by matching our global contributor network against the unique needs of our customers. This model allows us to offer customers a fast and scalable way to produce cost-effective content that is in line with the visual footprint of their brand. The processes we maintain to properly license content and the indemnification protections we provide allow individuals and businesses of all sizes, including media agencies, publishers and creative service providers, to license creative content with the confidence to utilize the licensed content to meet their unique commercial or editorial needs.
We believe that our licensing model and e-commerce platform drive a high volume of download activity that in turn provides a high volume of search, download and other customer behavioral data that enables us to continuously improve the quality and accuracy of our proprietary search algorithms, including keyword and similar image identification, and encourages the creation and contribution of new content to meet our customers’ needs. We enable users to search and discover content to meet their unique needs by searching our collection and previewing our content at no cost prior to licensing.
Our Products
We offer licenses for a variety of content types, including current, archival and commissioned photographs, illustrations, vector art, video clips and music tracks. Generally, we provide our content under a royalty-free non-exclusive license and each piece of content available for license has been vetted by a team of reviewers to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and can be appropriately licensed for commercial or editorial use. We provide several content offerings across our e-commerce platform, as follows:

• | Shutterstock - Shutterstock is our flagship brand and the majority of our revenue is generated through the shutterstock.com website. We continuously work to expand the collection of photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips available on shutterstock.com to establish Shutterstock as a top source of high quality digital imagery for multimedia producers world-wide.


• | Bigstock - Bigstock maintains a separate, extensive library of unique photographs, vectors, illustrations and video clips that is specifically curated to meet the needs of independent creators and others seeking to incorporate cost-effective digital imagery into their projects.


• | Offset - For high-impact use cases that require extraordinary imagery, our Offset brand provides authentic and exceptional imagery, featuring work from top assignment photographers and illustrators from around the world, in addition to work from established and respected collections such as National Geographic® and The Licensing Project™. Every image in the collection is hand-selected, chosen for its artistic distinction and narrative quality, and is curated into specific categories such as lifestyle, food, travel and fashion.


• | Shutterstock Custom - Shutterstock Custom is a complementary offering of Shutterstock’s creative platform that fulfills marketers’ need to scale high-quality and unique branded content including photos, videos, GIFs, cinemagraphs and 360° video. Shutterstock Custom is powered by the expertise and proprietary technology that we acquired through our acquisition of Flashstock Technology, Inc. (“Flashstock”) in 2017, and which we expect to grow in the future as we continue our expansion in the market for custom content creation.


• | Shutterstock Editorial - Shutterstock Editorial provides editorial imagery, such as entertainment, sports and news images, to a broad range of customers from independent bloggers to traditional media outlets by providing a real-time feed of editorial content and an extensive archive of photos and videos. We acquired Rex Features in 2015 and in the past several years, we have entered into distribution agreements with a number of leading editorial image agencies and industry partners, continuing our expansion into the market for editorial content.

• | Shutterstock Music - Shutterstock Music provides thousands of high-quality audio tracks and sound effects at affordable prices, giving businesses, marketers, producers and filmmakers access to the audio content they need to bring their ideas to life. We acquired PremiumBeat in 2015 to enhance the depth of our existing music library and the quality of our overall offering in the marketplace.

In addition to our content products, we also provide workflow tools and digital asset management services for enterprise businesses:

• | Editor - Shutterstock Editor is a free in-browser cloud-based tool that provides a robust solution for creative professionals to quickly size, edit and enhance content for immediate social media and other publishing.


• | Webdam - Webdam provides tools to marketing and creative teams through its digital asset management service. Webdam’s products help organizations manage, search, distribute and collaborate on creative and other brand-building activities to reach new audiences.

On February 15, 2018, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the Webdam business for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $49.1 million. The purchase price, subject to adjustments typical for transactions of this type, is payable in cash at closing, which is expected to occur on or about February 26, 2018.
Sales and Distribution Channels
We strive to offer simple, transparent purchase options that remove complexity from a customer’s workflow. The majority of our licenses come through our e-commerce platform, with customers typically paying in advance or at the time of license. This has historically resulted in favorable timing of cash flows relative to the time that revenue is recognized and contributor royalties are earned and paid.
 Customer sales are made through the following channels:

• | E-commerce: The majority of our customers purchase content directly through our web properties. E-commerce customers have the flexibility to purchase a subscription plan that is paid on a monthly or annual basis or to purchase content à la carte. These customers generally license content under our standard license, with additional licensing options available to meet customers’ individual needs. E-commerce customers typically pay the full amount of the purchase price in advance or at the time of license, generally with a credit card.


• | Enterprise: Our base of enterprise customers is mainly composed of creative professionals and large organizations with unique content, licensing and workflow needs. Customers of this size benefit from dedicated sales, service and research teams which provide a number of enhancements to their creative workflows including non-standard licensing rights, multi-seat access, invoicing and the ability to pay on credit terms, increased indemnification protection, multi-brand licensing packages and content licensed for use-cases outside of those available on our e-commerce platform.


• | Other: Other sales channels include sales of Webdam’s digital asset management offerings which are made available through annual software-as-a-service subscription plans, and content licensed outside of our e-commerce and enterprise channels, including through application program interfaces that allow our content to be licensed through third-party websites, applications and software.

Revenues generated from each of the sales channels are as follows (in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,

Our Customers
We serve a diverse array of customers across a variety of industries, organizational sizes and geographies. For the year ended December 31, 2017, more than 1.8 million customers in more than 150 countries licensed revenue-generating content, with approximately 39%, 33% and 28% of revenue coming from customers in North America, Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. Our top 25 customers in the aggregate accounted for less than 5% of our revenue in 2017. Our customers are classified among three categories, as follows: 

• | Marketing Agencies. Marketing agencies incorporate licensed content in the work they produce for their clients’ business communications. Whether providing graphic design, web design, interactive design, advertising, public relations, communications or marketing services, our marketing agency users range from independent freelancers to the largest global agencies. 


• | Media Professionals. Media organizations and professionals incorporate licensed content into their work, which includes digital publications, newspapers, books, magazines, television and film, as well as to market their products effectively. Our media users range from independent bloggers to multi-national publishing and broadcast organizations. 


• | Other Organizations. Organizations of all sizes utilize content for a wide range of internal- and external-use communications such as websites, print and digital advertisements, annual reports, brochures, employee communications, newsletters, email marketing campaigns and other presentations. These organizations range in size and type of organization, from sole proprietors to large not-for-profit organizations and Fortune 500 companies. 

Content Contributors and Content Review Process
Our collection of creative content is provided by a community of contributors from around the world and is vetted by our proprietary technology and specialized team of reviewers to ensure that it meets our standards of quality and licensability. Whether photographers, videographers, illustrators, designers or musicians, our community of more than 350,000 approved contributors as of December 31, 2017 ranges from part-time enthusiasts to full-time professionals, and all of them must meet the content standards that our customers have come to expect from Shutterstock. Supplementing the content in our collection, enabled by our acquisition of Flashstock, we launched Shutterstock Custom in 2017, which connects business customers with a vast network of contributors from whom to request custom branded imagery to meet their most specific content needs. The content contributed by our five highest-earning contributors was together responsible for less than 5% of downloads in 2017.
The breadth and quality of our content offerings are critical to our success, and we have created an easy-to-use online account creation process, through which we enable contributors to create an account, become verified, submit content, and once approved for submission, upload content onto our platform for licensing. We evaluate content submissions based on certain technical and legal criteria to ensure we maintain the quality and integrity of our content library, including whether applicable releases have been obtained, whether third-party intellectual property is excluded and seeking to minimize other technical concerns such as excess noise or focus issues. As of December 31, 2017, over 260 million images and video clips have been submitted from verified contributor accounts. For each content submission that is not approved during the review process, we notify the contributor by email with an explanation why the image was not published, including guidance on our standards and insight into customers’ expectations; we believe that this feedback is valuable to contributors and enhances the quality of future content submissions as well as our customers’ experience. 
We use proprietary computer vision technology along with a trained team of reviewers to complete a comprehensive evaluation of all content submissions. Our content review process is highly efficient, and our content review team strives to evaluate and process images and video clips within 24 hours of submission to make them available for license on our sites, while working to continually improve our process to reduce review time.
Contributors are required to add a descriptive title and up to 50 keywords to each image and video clip submitted. We guide our contributors to provide terms that not only describe literally the objects in the image or clip, but also what is conveyed conceptually and thematically. We provide technical keywording assistance to contributors through our suggested keyword tools, which include a tool that leverages our proprietary computer vision technology to automatically suggest keywords based on visually similar images. We have compiled a vast amount of data relating to the content in our collection, including keywords and aggregated customer behavioral data, which combined with our proprietary computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, drives discovery of content through our search algorithms and search engine optimization (SEO), therefore empowering customers to discover the content best suited for their needs.
Content accepted into our collection is added to our websites where it is available for search, selection, license and download. Contributors are paid based on how many times their content has been licensed in the previous month. Contributors may choose to remove their content from our collection at any time.

We provide different earnings structures to contributors based on content type and customers’ licensing needs:

• | Images. Contributors of photographs, vectors and illustrations to our e-commerce platform typically earn a royalty each time their images are licensed and the type of license obtained for the image downloaded. The exact amount earned is determined by the type of license obtained and our published earnings schedule which is based on (i) the contributor’s total historical earnings paid by us, which determines the contributor’s earnings tier; and (ii) the purchase option under which the content was licensed. Contributors are able to earn more per download when images are licensed under our custom licensing options or are licensed for editorial use only and, in these instances, can earn up to 50% of the sales price for a licensed image. 


• | Video Clips and Music. Contributors of video clips and music tracks also typically earn a royalty each time their video clips or music tracks are licensed. When a contributed video clip or music track is licensed, the contributor is typically paid between 30% and 50% of the sales price per download. 

In addition to content sourced through direct submission to our e-commerce platform, we also obtain all types of content through exclusive distribution agreements with strategic partners or through the direct acquisition of content, content libraries or archives. In certain cases, we enter into arrangements with contributors or strategic partners whereby we guarantee a minimum royalty, usually paid up-front, in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute content when we believe such exclusivity provides us with a distinct competitive advantage. When we license content that has been obtained through direct acquisition, we pay no royalties. In recent years, we have enhanced our content collection through the direct acquisition of content and through entering into several such agreements and partnerships. We have also enhanced our collections and our content acquisition capabilities through our acquisitions of PremiumBeat, Rex Features, The Picture Desk Limited, and Flashstock. We continue to seek opportunities for direct acquisition and strategic partnerships to enhance our collection and provide customers with relevant and high-quality content.
Technology and Infrastructure
Our technology is critical to our business and we have developed proprietary technology and a robust infrastructure to power our products and services. We believe that delivering intuitive, fast and effective user experiences, supported by scalable technology platforms, is critical to our success.
We employ technology to support our public-facing websites and our back-office systems. In developing and enhancing these sites and systems, we focus our internal development efforts on creating and enhancing specialized proprietary software that is unique to our business and we leverage commercially available and open source technologies for our more generalized needs.
Our customer-facing software enables users to search the millions of digital images, vectors, illustrations, video clips and music tracks available in our collection or request custom branded content and then select, organize, pay for, license and download the content that suits their individual needs. Our proprietary search algorithms evolve automatically based on behavioral data, with each search and download that a user performs on our platform providing our search engine with additional information to improve search results in subsequent queries. We consider the data that we have collected and the search technology that it powers to be an important proprietary asset that allows us to provide exceptional service to our customers and enable our business. 
We also continue to build and launch innovations to the customer experience. In 2016 we launched Shutterstock Editor to further enhance the customer experience by providing users the ability to customize certain content without leaving their browser, improving the customer’s workflow and eliminating time-consuming steps in the creative process, and we have continued to improve the features, functionality and availability of this tool during 2017. We continue to invest in the localization of our e-commerce platform across many countries and regions, allowing customers to search and make purchases in a variety of languages and currencies. 
Another of our customer-facing software platforms is Webdam, which services a broad range of enterprise customers by offering a more seamless experience to enterprise users as they license, store and share digital assets through Webdam’s cloud-based software platform. 
We have developed contributor-facing websites that enable individuals and creative professionals to become contributors, upload and tag content, receive feedback on their submissions from our review team, see reports on earnings and payouts, and participate in online discussion forums with other contributors, among other activities. We have also developed proprietary tools to enable our contributors to improve their success on our websites, including our keyword trends tool that allows contributors to see what terms customers are searching for and how those search terms are trending over time, which allows contributors to anticipate demand and generate content that customers may want to license. Our contributor-facing websites are powered by proprietary technology which supports a content review system that allows our review team to efficiently and 
7

accurately review content submissions. Our combination of proprietary technology and large-scale datasets allows us to deliver value to our users and enhance their experience on our platform, which drives and grows our marketplace.
We use a combination of internally-developed software and third-party applications that enable customer and contributor support, intellectual property rights and license tracking, centralized invoicing and sales order processing, customer database management, language translation and global contributor payouts, in addition to supporting the compliance, finance and accounting functions.
Our systems infrastructure is hosted by industry-leading third-party hosting providers that offer 24-hour monitoring, high-speed network access, auxiliary power generators and back-up systems. In 2017, we made additional investments in our infrastructure to improve our customer experience and to increase the velocity of product development by enabling developer productivity, and expect this investment to continue in 2018 to the extent we believe such investments will improve the long-term profitability of the business. Third-party public cloud hosting and enhancements to our code base have already enabled us to add new product offerings to our platform with increased speed and experimentation. We believe continued use of public cloud hosting will allow us to further diversify our product offerings, reach new customers and contributors around the world and, by removing inhibitors related to our infrastructure, enable our developers to rapidly deploy new products, features and functionality. Further, by delivering an application programming interface (API) driven infrastructure, we believe that our technology teams will be able to focus their resources on revenue-generating activities, rather than on operations and maintenance. We maintain multiple production data centers to provide rapid content delivery to our customers and to support business continuity in the event of an emergency. We have expanded our use of content delivery network solutions to help enable our customers around the world to have sustained and reliable high-speed access to our content marketplace. Network, website, service and hardware-level monitoring, coupled with remote-content monitoring, allow our systems to maintain a high level of uptime and availability with high-performance delivery.
As we continue to grow our business, our technological needs continue to expand and therefore, we continually invest in our technology to enhance existing products and services and to develop new products and services. We view our investments in technology as integral to our long-term success and we intend to continue to investigate, develop and make increased capital investments in technology and operational systems that support our current business and new areas of potential business expansion.
Marketing and Customer Support
We reach new customers through a diverse set of performance and brand marketing channels including paid search, online display advertising, print advertising, tradeshows, email marketing, direct mail, affiliate marketing, public relations, social media and partnerships. We also use customer relationship management (CRM) marketing to grow the lifetime value of our existing customers. Our marketing activities aim to raise awareness of our brands and attract paying customers to our websites and our direct sales organization by promoting the key value propositions of our offerings: diverse and high-quality content, intuitive and efficient interfaces and economical content options.
As our marketing efforts attract additional paying customers and generate more revenue for us, our contributors are also able to receive increased earnings from us. Increasing contributor earnings helps attract more content submissions, which in turn helps Shutterstock convert and retain even more paying customers. We believe the high degree of satisfaction that customers have with our product drives word-of-mouth recommendations, which helps our marketing efforts attract an even broader audience than we reach directly. Therefore, we believe our marketing efforts have a self-reinforcing network effect, which powers the growth and success of our marketplace.
In addition to outbound marketing activities, our customer service teams assist users worldwide via email, chat and phone in multiple languages, 24 hours a day. 
Sales
The majority of our revenue is generated via self-serve e-commerce. We encourage our customers to take advantage of our e-commerce platform’s comprehensive search capabilities, our credit card-based payment options and the immediate digital delivery of licensed content. We believe the ability to search for, select, license and download content over the internet offers our users convenience and speed, and enables us to achieve greater economies of scale.
Direct communication with our customers, however, remains a significant component of our sales strategy and we are able to address inbound sales inquiries and outbound sales leads and offer customized content and service packages to meet our customers’ needs through the efforts of our global sales service team. We also have contractual arrangements with third-party resellers to license digital content to customers, providing access to customers in markets where we do not have a significant sales and marketing presence. Third-party resellers sell our products directly to end-user customers and remit a fixed amount to us based on the type of content plan sold.

Product Rights and Intellectual Property
Product Rights and Indemnification
All of the content that we make available to customers on our websites is offered under perpetual, royalty-free licenses, with the exception of certain custom, editorial, music, and other content with specific licensing requirements. Royalty-free means that once a customer has licensed content from us, that customer may use the associated content in accordance with the license terms in perpetuity without having to pay any ongoing royalties to us. Typically, content from our library is licensed on a non-exclusive basis, meaning that multiple customers can license the same image, video clip or music track under the applicable Shutterstock license agreement. Custom content is one-of-a-kind branded content and licensed on an exclusive basis to our customers to fulfill their specific use-cases. We do not typically require that contributors of content to our library provide their content to us on an exclusive basis, with the exception of custom content and certain editorial, music and other content to which we have exclusive distribution rights. However, once a contributor’s content is licensed through our platform, such content is forever subject to the customer’s license even if the contributor removes the image from our marketplace, except in periodic circumstances where content is removed due to concerns about third-party intellectual property rights. 
Under our various license agreements, we expressly represent and warrant that unaltered content downloaded and used in compliance with our license agreements and applicable law will not infringe any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, violate any third party’s rights of privacy or publicity, violate any U.S. law, be defamatory or libelous, or be pornographic or obscene. Provided that a customer has not breached the license agreement or any other agreement with us, we will defend, indemnify, and hold a customer harmless from direct damages attributable to breaches of the express representations and warranties provided in our license agreements. From time to time, we agree to customize our license agreements with non-standard indemnification terms. Regardless of customization, indemnification only applies to claims for damages attributable to our breach of the express representations and warranties provided in our license agreement and is generally conditioned on our timely receipt of an indemnification claim and our right to assume the defense of such claim. Our license agreements generally cap our indemnification obligations at amounts ranging from $10,000 to $250,000, with exceptions for certain products for which our indemnification obligations may be uncapped. We maintain commercially reasonable insurance intended to protect against the costs of intellectual property litigation and our indemnification obligations under our license agreements.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and domain name registrations, as well as trade secret protections.
We own a portfolio of trademarks, including “Shutterstock,” “Offset,” “Bigstock,” “Rex Features,” “PremiumBeat” and “Webdam” and associated logos. We will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent that we create any additional material and registrable trademarks or logos. We are the registered owner of a variety of the shutterstock.com, bigstock.com, offset.com, webdam.com, premiumbeat.com, and rexfeatures.com internet domain names and various other related domain names. We have successfully recovered infringing domain names in the past and intend to continue to enforce our rights in the future. We also own copyrights, including certain content in our websites, publications and designs, as well as patents, including with respect to our display systems and search capabilities. These intellectual property rights are important to our business and marketing efforts. The duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question, the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction and the terms of our license agreements with others. With respect to our trademarks, trade names and patents, laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries where a mark has been registered or protected. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark or title is not registrable or protectable or cannot be used in a particular country. In addition, a trademark registration may be canceled or invalidated if challenged by others based on certain use requirements or other limited grounds. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate, relative to the expected lives of our products.
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law rights, including registration, in the United States and applicable foreign jurisdictions, as well as contractual restrictions. We enforce and protect our intellectual property rights through litigation from time to time, and by controlling access to our intellectual property and proprietary technology, in part, by entering into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and vendors. In this way, we have historically chosen to protect our software and other technological intellectual property as trade secrets. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our websites’ terms of use and license agreements.

Government Regulation
The legal environment of the internet and online content is evolving rapidly in the United States and worldwide. The development of new laws and regulations, the manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the internet and online content in general, and how the foregoing will relate to our business in particular, is unclear in many cases. For example, there is uncertainty regarding how laws and regulations will apply in the online context and to different business models, including with respect to such topics as privacy, data management and cyber-security, defamation, e-commerce, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, subscription-based billing, content regulation, quality of products and services, internet neutrality, outsourcing, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Numerous laws have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States that could have an impact on online commerce generally and on our business. These laws include, for example, the following:

• | The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) regulates digital material and created updated copyright laws to address the unique challenges of regulating the use of digital content.


• | The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states regulate the format, functionality and distribution of commercial solicitation e-mails, create criminal penalties for unmarked sexually-oriented material, and control other online marketing practices.


• | The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and the Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 regulate the collection or use of information, and restrict the distribution of certain materials, as related to certain protected age groups. In addition, the Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998 provides for reporting and other obligations by online service providers in the area of child pornography.


• | Federal and state regulatory agencies are accelerating the consideration, adoption and enforcement of rules and guidelines concerning data security measures and reporting of cyberattacks and other security breaches of personal data to affected individuals, regulatory agencies, law enforcement officials and other third parties.


• | The Federal Trade Commission Act and numerous state “mini-FTC” acts bar “deceptive” and “unfair” trade practices, including in the contexts of online advertising and representations made in privacy policies and other online representations. Federal and state regulatory agencies are also accelerating the consideration, adoption and enforcement of rules, regulations and guidelines that govern online service providers’ data collection, processing, retention, transfer and use policies and practices, including with respect to the disclosure of consumer data to third parties such as direct marketers.

Many of these laws and regulations have international analogues that apply to our business, have become stricter over time, and may continue to become stricter in the future.
Given the broad spectrum of legal and regulatory uncertainties, we expect new laws and regulations to be adopted over time that are likely to be applicable to the internet and to our activities. Any existing or new legislation applicable to Shutterstock could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and regulations, to respond to regulatory inquiries or investigations, and to defend individual or class litigation. These events could dampen growth in the use of the internet in general, and cause Shutterstock to divert significant resources and funds to addressing these issues, and possibly require us to change our business practices.
We post privacy policies on our websites concerning our data collection, use and sharing practices. We have also implemented, and continuously improve upon, various data security measures. Allegations that our policy disclosures are inadequate or that we have failed to comply with our posted privacy policies, that our security measures are insufficient, or that we otherwise violated Federal Trade Commission or state requirements or other privacy-related laws and regulations, could result in proceedings by governmental or regulatory bodies or private parties that could potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is a risk that privacy, data security and marketing laws may be interpreted and applied differently in certain jurisdictions, in ways that are not consistent with our current practices, which could also potentially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In this regard, there are a large number of legislative and regulatory proposals before the United States Congress, various state legislative bodies, and government agencies regarding privacy, security, marketing and other consumer issues that may affect our business. It is not possible to predict whether or when such rules and regulations may be adopted, or how existing or new rules or regulations could be interpreted by courts or agencies, however, it is possible that the foregoing could harm our business by, among other things, decreasing user registrations and revenue, increasing the cost of compliance, impeding the development of new products or services, and limiting potential sources of revenue such as online advertising. These adverse effects on our businesses could be caused by, among other possible provisions, the required display of specific disclaimers, requirements to obtain consent from 
10

users for certain activities, costly security measures or other requirements before users can utilize our services. In addition, we may be subject to claims of liability or responsibility for the actions of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in relation to various services, including but not limited to vendors, payment processors and business partners. These third parties may be vulnerable to violations of privacy laws, threats such as computer hacking, cyber-terrorism or other unauthorized attempts to access, modify or delete our or our customers’ information or business assets that they service or maintain on our behalf. Further, Shutterstock itself may be the target of cyberattacks or other unlawful or unauthorized efforts to access, use, acquire or disclose information that we ourselves maintain, and such information may also be subject to accidental loss, destruction or alteration.
In addition, there is a significant increase in non-U.S. jurisdictions considering, adopting and enforcing existing and new laws and regulations regarding a broad spectrum of data privacy, data management, data transfer/localization, marketing, anti-spam, data security and other matters related to online businesses and e-commerce, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which will take effect May 25, 2018 and will govern how we can collect and process the personal data of European Union citizens. Non-U.S. laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States and often have extraterritorial application. Due to the global nature of the internet, it is possible that the governments of other states and countries might attempt to regulate our online activities such as digital transmissions, regulate our data privacy and security measures, or prosecute us for alleged violations of their laws. We might violate such laws; such laws or their interpretation or application may be modified; and new laws may be enacted in the future. Any such developments could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may be subject to legal liability for our online services. The law relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Claims may also be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other reasons based on the nature and content of information that we collect or use, or to or from which we provide links or that may be posted online.
In addition, from a taxation perspective, there are applicable and potential government regulatory matters that may impact the Company:

• | On December 22, 2017, H.R.1 (commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”)) was signed into law, representing a significant overhaul to the U.S. federal income tax code. The TCJA has a significant impact on our financial statements for 2017 and will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations in future years. We address our reasonable estimate of the impact of the provisions of the TCJA on our 2017 financial statements throughout this document. We anticipate uncertainty regarding how these provisions are to be implemented. The TCJA is also open to further interpretation and technical corrections in the U.S. and potential reaction from foreign jurisdictions, which have already expressed reservations and concerns about certain provisions of the TCJA. As we complete our analysis of the TCJA, we may refine our current estimate and make adjustments that could materially change our estimate of the total income tax impact to the Company.

Competition
We compete to be an integral component of the creative process for our customers based on a number of factors including the quality, relevance and breadth of content; ability to source new content; accessibility of content, distribution capabilities; ease and speed of search and fulfillment; content pricing models and practices; content licensing options and the degree to which users are protected from legal risk; brand recognition and reputation; the effective use of current and emerging technology; the global nature of the Company’s interfaces and marketing efforts, including the degree of localization; and customer service. We also compete for contributors on the basis of several similar factors including ease and speed of the upload and content review process; the volume of customers who license their submitted content; contributor commission models and practices; the degree to which contributors are protected from legal risk; brand recognition and reputation; the effective use of technology; the global nature of the Company’s interfaces; and customer service.
We also leverage, to the greatest extent possible, the global nature of our user interfaces and marketing efforts, including local languages, currencies and payment methods and our effective use of current and emerging technology and marketing channels to attract and retain customers and contributors. We believe that we benefit from a network effect between customers and contributors: as we have grown, our broadening audience of paying users has attracted more content from contributors, and the increasing selection of high-quality content has in turn helped to attract more customers to our sites. The success of this network effect is facilitated by the trust that users place in Shutterstock to maintain the quality and integrity of our branded marketplace, and our commitment to seamless integration into users’ creative workflows.
The industry in which we operate is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, with low barriers to entry. Some of our current and potential significant competitors include:

• | other online platforms that feature marketplaces for stock content or creative workflow tools such as Getty Images and their iStockphoto offering and AdobeStock;

• | specialized visual content companies that are established in local, content or product-specific market segments, such as Visual China Group;


• | providers of commercially licensable music such as Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Warner Music Group, and EMI Music Publishing;


• | websites focused on image search and discovery such as Google Images;


• | websites for image hosting, art and related products such as Flickr;


• | other providers of cloud-based digital asset management tools;


• | social networking and social media services; and


• | commissioned photographers and photography agencies.

In addition, we compete with the alternative of creating one’s own content or choosing not to consume licensed content due to price considerations or because the user is not aware of how to access licensed content.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, our global workforce included 1,130 full-time employees. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. In several foreign jurisdictions, including Germany, Canada and France, our employees may be subject to national collective bargaining agreements that set minimum salaries, benefits, working conditions and/or termination requirements. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
Segments and Geographic Areas
Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of the risks attendant to foreign operations, see the information in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international operations and our continued expansion internationally expose us to many risks.” For a discussion of revenue, net income and total assets, see Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors. Our quarterly and annual results may reflect the effects of intra-period trends in customer behavior. For example, we expect certain customers’ usage to decrease during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the year-end holiday season, and to increase in the first quarter of each calendar year as many customers return to work. Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from repeat customers who have purchased subscription plans, our revenues have historically been less volatile than if we had no subscription-based customers.
