ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Orgenesis Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a global biotech company working to unlock the potential of cell and gene therapies (“CGTs”) in an affordable and accessible format.
 
CGTs can be centered on autologous (using the patient’s own cells) or allogenic (using master banked donor cells) and are part of a class of medicines referred to as advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMP”). We are mostly focused on autologous therapies, with processes and systems that are developed for each therapy using a closed and automated processing system approach that is validated for compliant production near the patient for treatment of the patient at the point of care (“POCare”). This approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional commercial manufacturing methods that do not translate well to commercial production of advanced therapies due to their cost prohibitive nature and complex logistics to deliver such treatments to patients (ultimately limiting the number of patients that can have access to, or can afford, these therapies).
 
To achieve these goals, we have developed a Point of Care Platform (“POCare Platform”) comprised of three enabling components: (i) a pipeline of licensed POCare advanced therapies that are designed to be processed and produced, (ii) automated closed POCare technology systems, and (iii) a collaborative worldwide network of POCare research institutes and hospitals (“POCare Network”).
 
The POCare Platform relies, in particular, on the development of its own production capacity, known as “POCare Services”, the goal of which is to ensure that therapies are accessible at the point of treatment (the “POCare Center”). POCare Services, which have been expanding worldwide, are based on a global approach and local adaptation that allows replication and expansion. Global harmonization of the POCare Services is ensured by a central quality system, replicability of infrastructure and equipment and centralized monitoring and data management.
 
The POCare Services include:
 

● | Process development of therapies that are intended for use of the POCare Network; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Adaptation of automation and closed systems to such therapies; 
● | Incorporation of the processing systems and the Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) in the Orgenesis Mobile Processing Units and Labs (“OMPULs”); 
● | Tech transfers to required POCare Centers and training of local teams; 
● | Processing and supply of the therapies and required supplies under GMP conditions by the various POCare Centers, including required quality control testing; and 
● | Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) services for clinical trials. 

 
POCare Centers are the decentralized hubs that provide harmonized services to customers and partners. We are working to provide a more efficient and scalable pathway for advanced therapies to reach patients more rapidly at lowered costs. The workflow of a POCare Center is designed to allow rapid capacities expansion while integrating new technologies. We also draw upon extensive medical expertise to identify promising new autologous therapies to leverage within the POCare Platform either via ownership or licensing.

The POCare Network brings together patients, doctors and industry partners with a goal of achieving harmonized, regulated clinical development and production of POCare advanced therapies.
 
We have worked to develop and validate POCare technologies that can be combined within mobile production units for advanced therapies. We have made significant investments in the development of several types of OMPULs with the expectation of use and/or distribution through our POCare Network and/or partners, collaborators, and regional distributors. As of the date of this report, the OMPULs have been adapted for processing of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (“CAR-T”), tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (“TIL”) TILS and mesenchymal stem cell (“MSC”) based products and are in the qualification stage for clinical use in various locations. Additional OMPULs are still in the development stage.
 
OMPULs are designed for the purpose of validation, development, performance of clinical trials, manufacturing and/or processing of potential or approved advanced therapy products in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner at the point of care, as well as the manufacturing of such CGTs in a consistent and standardized manner in all locations. The OMPUL design delivers a potential industrial solution for us to deliver CGTs to practically any clinical institution at the point of care.
 
We have continued to grow our infrastructure and expand our processing sites into new markets and jurisdictions. In addition, we have continued investing manpower and financial resources to focus on developing, processing and rolling out several types of OMPULs to be used and/or distributed through our POCare Network and/or partners, collaborators, and regional distributors.

The Discontinued Operation includes the vast majority of the previous CDMO Business, including majority-owned Masthercell Inc and its subsidiaries.
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Overview
 
ATMP means one of any of the following medicinal products that are developed and commercialized for human use:
 

● | A somatic cell therapy medicinal product (“STMP”) that contains cells or tissues that have been manipulated to change their biological characteristics or cells or tissues not intended to be used for the same essential functions in the body. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A tissue engineered product (“TEP”) that contains cells or tissues that have been modified so that they can be used to repair, regenerate, or replace human tissue. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A gene therapy medicinal product (“GTMP”) that engineers genes that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic effect and, in many cases, work by inserting “recombinant” genes into the body, usually to treat a variety of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancer, or long-term diseases. In this case, a recombinant gene is a stretch of DNA that is created in the laboratory, bringing together DNA from different sources. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
It is important to note that although STMPs and GTMPs currently dominate the market, in order to access the market potential and trends in the future, other cell products are likely to be essential in all of these categories.
 
We believe that autologous therapies represent a substantial segment of the ATMP market. Autologous therapies are produced from a patient’s own cells versus allogeneic therapies that are mass-cultivated from donor cells via the construction of master and working cell banks, are then produced on a large scale. Developers and manufacturers of ATMPs (both autologous and allogeneic) currently rely heavily on production using traditional centralized supply chains and manufacturing sites.

CGTs are costly and complex to produce. We also refer to CGTs as “living” drugs since they are based on maintaining the cells vitality. Therefore, there is no possibility to sterilize the products, since such a process involves killing any living organism. Many of these therapies require sourcing of the patient’s cells, engineering them in a sterile environment and then transplanting them back to the patient (so-called “autologous” CGT). This presents multiple logistic challenges as each patient requires its own production batch, and the current processes involve complex laboratory-based types of manipulations requiring highly trained lab technicians. We are leveraging a unique approach to therapy production using the POCare Platform to potentially overcome some of the development and supply chain challenges of affordably bringing autologous therapies to patients.
 
Allogeneic therapies are costly and complex to produce because autologous therapies are derived from the treated patient and manufactured through a defined protocol before re-administration. We are leveraging a unique approach to therapy production using the POCare Platform to potentially overcome some of the development and supply chain challenges of bringing autologous therapies to patients affordably.

Products in Clinical Use
 

1. | KYSLECEL® (Autologous Pancreatic Islets) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
KYSLECEL is made from a patient’s own pancreatic islets – the cells that make insulin to regulate blood sugar. KYSLECEL is intended to preserve insulin secretory capacity in chronic or acute recurrent pancreatitis patients after total pancreatectomy (TP-IAT). KYSLECEL is a minimally manipulated autologous cell-based product available in the United States and regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). KYSLECEL is produced according to current good tissue practices (cGTP) and in compliance with federal and state regulations. We are planning on initiating an observational study in the US to gain insight into KYSLECEL patient outcomes. Substantial efforts are being invested in promoting the process development and the marketing of KYSLECEL in the European Union. In May 2021 we submitted a request for classification to Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), who classified KYSLECEL as not being an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP). We have identified relevant Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) and established contact with islet transplantation/pancreas surgery centers in Germany and Switzerland. We are adjusting the KYSLECEL Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for European requirements for the initiation for the first clinical application. We are also monitoring the Chinese market for potential partners. Furthermore, we are training teams who will manage introduction into new markets by supporting the KYSLECEL tech transfer, as well as working on the OMPUlization process so as to manufacture via automated closed systems.
 

2. | Tissue Genesis Icellator® for Cell Assisted Lipotransfer 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Tissue Genesis Icellator is a point-of-care medical device that isolates stromal and vascular fraction cells (“SVF”) from a patient’s own (autologous) adipose tissue (fat). The Icellator is commercially available in Korea through a medical device distributor. The SVF obtained from the Icellator is for use in cell-assisted lipotransfer, a plastic surgery procedure intended to improve fat engraftments.
 

3. | Cartil-S Autologous Products for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Cartil-S is a cell therapy for Osteoarthritis. This product is produced by performing a minimally invasive biopsy of adipose (fat) tissue from a patient, followed by isolation and expansion of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), to be injected arthroscopically. The autologous injectable product helps delay/stop the progression of osteoarthritis, involving the patient’s own stem cells.
 

4. | Chondroseal Autologous Products for the Treatment of Cartilage Defects (Osteoarthritis) 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Chondroseal is a cell therapy for cartilage defects. Following collection of adipose tissue by minimally invasive biopsy that is composed of ADSCs, the cells are combined with a natural gel serving as a scaffold for local cartilage regeneration in the joint.
 
Products in Clinical Trials
 

5. | RanTop, Ranpirnase Topical Formulation 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are currently developing a novel topical formulation of an active RNA-degrading enzyme, called Ranpirnase. Ranpirnase combats viral infections by targeting double-stranded RNA including miRNA precursors, via RNA degradation catalysis. It acts through a dual mechanism: 1) Inhibition of viral replication; and 2) induction of host cell apoptosis. Topical Ranpirnase demonstrated good tolerability and preliminary clinical efficacy in the treatment of HPV-associated external anogenital warts (EGW) in a Phase 2a clinical study conducted in Bolivia.

During 2021 we prepared a detailed pre-IND briefing package and received positive pre-IND feedback from the FDA on the development plan and proposed clinical study under an IND of topical Ranprinase for the treatment of EGW. The FDA generally confirmed that the proposed preclinical development plan should support a Phase 2b study of topical Ranprinase in EGW. The proposed plan included a dermal toxicology study using the gel formulation.
 
We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments the feasibility of Ranprinase encapsulation in the Orgenesis Bioxome delivery platform. Encapsulation enhanced Ranprinase anti-viral activity in an in-vitro test. We have also shown feasibility of producing an active recombinant Ranprinase. Recombinant production could in the future replace the sourced Ranprinase to improve manufacturing scalability, eliminate dependence on procurement of rana pipiens frog oocytes and potentially decrease production cost.
 

6. | Tissue Geneseis Icellator® for Erectile Dysfunction and COVID-19 (SVF-CLI-ED) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The safety of the Tissue Genesis Icellator, and use of SVF produced by the Icellator, has previously been tested in a number of pilot clinical trials in the United States. Orgenesis has prioritized the clinical development of the Icellator for potential use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and COVID-19 related respiratory complications. In 2021, the FDA approved our investigational device exemption (IDE) for a Pilot Clinical Trial of the Tissue Genesis Icellator to treat Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) resulting from COVID-19 infection.
 
The Tissue Genesis Icellator is also being used by research collaborators in FDA-regulated clinical trials to test the use of SVF during rotator cuff surgery.
 
Products in IND Enabling Studies
 

7. | Generation of Autologous Insulin-Producing Cells (AIPs) from Adult Liver Cells (“trans-differentiation technology”) 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Orgenesis Ltd. has trans-differentiation in-vitro technology that has demonstrated in animal models the capacity to induce a shift in the developmental fate of cells from the liver or other tissues, transdifferentiating them into “pancreatic beta cell-like” AIP cells for patients with Type 1 Diabetes (“T1D”), acute pancreatitis and other insulin deficient diseases. For the treatment of diabetes, cells are derived from the liver or other adult tissue and are trans-differentiated to become AIP cells. This technology has shown in relevant animal models that the human derived AIP cells produce insulin in a glucose-sensitive manner. No adverse effects were observed in any of the animal studies. This trans-differentiation technology is licensed by the Israeli Subsidiary and is based on the work of Prof. Sarah Ferber, a researcher at Tel Hashomer Medical Research Infrastructure and Services Ltd. (“THM”) in Israel. The development plan calls for conducting additional pre-clinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to diabetes and other potential indications prior to initiating human clinical trials.
 
With respect to the trans-differentiation technology, we have exclusive rights to eight (8) United States and twenty four (24) foreign issued patents, two (2) pending patent applications in the United States, eleven (11) pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Panama, South Korea, and Singapore. These patents and patent applications relate, among others, to the trans-differentiation of cells (including hepatic cells) to cells having pancreatic β-cell-like phenotype and function and to their use in the treatment of degenerative pancreatic disorders, including diabetes, pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis.
 
On June 11, 2019, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for our AIP cells as a cell replacement therapy for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia-prone diabetes resulting from total pancreatectomy (“TP”) due to chronic pancreatitis.
 
On April 29, 2019, we received Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval to collect liver biopsies from patients at Rambam Medical Center located in Haifa, Israel for a planned study to confirm the suitability of liver cells for personalized cell replacement therapy for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes resulting from total or partial pancreatectomy. The first patients were enrolled during 2020. The goal of the proposed study, entitled “Collection of Human Liver Biopsy and Whole Blood Samples from Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), Total or Partial Pancreatectomy Patients for Potential use as an Autologous Source for Insulin Producing Cells in Future Clinical Studies,” is to confirm the suitability of the liver cells for personalized cell replacement therapy, as well as eligibility of patients to participate in a future clinical study, as defined by successful AIP cell production from their own liver biopsy. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate patients’ immune response to AIPs based on the patient’s blood samples and followed by subcutaneous implantation into the patients’ arm which would represent the first human trial.

We have invested substantial efforts in the feasibility of upscaling the manufacturing process for expansion of liver cells to the number required for clinical application (i.e. approximately two billion cells). We were successful in developing the expansion protocols while maintaining the liver cells’ viability. However, the resulting cell expansion hampered the ability of the cells to efficiently transdifferentiate, as was determined in pre-clinical studies. Furthermore, combining the liver cells with alginate-based 3D scaffold failed to present significant potential of the scaffolds to support the cells’ survival in pre-clinical studies. We will consider if other indications require a lower number of cells. To date, we have not been successful in in identification of such other relevant therapies.
 
The trans-differentiation technology is from a licensing agreement entered into as of February 2, 2012 by the Israeli Subsidiary and THM pursuant to which the Israeli Subsidiary, Orgenesis Ltd, was granted a worldwide royalty bearing and exclusive license (the “THM License Agreement”). By using therapeutic agents that efficiently convert a sub-population of liver cells into pancreatic islets phenotype and function, this approach allows the diabetic patient to be the donor of his own therapeutic tissue. While we believe that this provides a major competitive advantage to the cell transformation technology of the Israeli Subsidiary, we also believe that our expanded focus to other therapies and business activities may continue to prompt THM to inquire of such activities as they may relate to our compliance with the terms or direction of the THM License Agreement. While we have not received any notice of cancellation of the THM License Agreement, we have received an allegation regarding the scope of the rights by THM that may present future challenges for our Israeli Subsidiary to continue to develop, manufacture, sell and market the products pursuant to the milestones and time schedule specified in the development plan of the THM License Agreement. In addition, THM has filed a complaint against us in the Tel Aviv District Court relating to the scope of such THM License and the royalties and other payments that THM is entitled to thereunder. See “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 

8. | CAR-T CD19 
---+-------------------------------------------------------

 
ORG-CAR19, Autologous anti CD19 CAR-T Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (known as CAR-T cells) are genetically engineered to express an artificial T-cell receptor for cancer immunotherapy. The promise of CAR-T immunotherapy is to engineer T cells to effectively recognize a specific antigen present on cancer cells to destroy those cells. CAR-T cells can be either derived from the patient’s own T cells (autologous) or from T cells of a healthy donor (allogeneic). Once isolated from a person, these T cells are genetically engineered to express a specific CAR, which programs them to target an antigen present on the surface of tumors. After CAR-T cells are infused into a patient, they act as a “living drug” against cancer cells expressing the target antigen.
 
We are developing a new anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy for treating patients with B-cell malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Malignant B cells of these patients express the CD19 protein on their surface that is targeted by the CAR-T cells. Orgenesis anti-CD19 CAR-T is based on a clinically used CAR-T therapy licensed from Kecellitics Biotech.
 

9. | Dual Cellular vaccine (DUVAC), Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The DUVAC cell-based immunotherapy, licensed from Columbia University, is based on autologous dendritic cells and macrophages. These cells are key coordinators of the innate and adaptive immune system and have critical roles in the induction of antitumor immunity. The cells are exposed to whole cancer cells and constitute the most comprehensive source of cancer antigens, which may boost the patient immune system and direct it against the tumor. We believe that a vaccine based on DUVAC vaccine can potentially be developed for a wide range of solid tumors, but our initial focus is on pancreatic cancer. We have signed a Material Transfer Agreement with a leading medical center in the US for their clinical grade pancreatic tumor cell lines to be used for proof-of concept

10. | Metabolically Optimized T-Cells (MOTC): Therapy for melanoma and lung cancer 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In the early stages of cancer, some lymphocytes successfully attack and infiltrate the tumor microenvironment, surround the tumor cells, and mount an anti-tumor response. TIL therapy is a clinically validated personalized cancer treatment based on infusion of autologous TILs expanded ex vivo from tumors. Once expanded, the TILs are infused back into the patient where they attack the cancer cells with a high degree of specificity.
 
We have recently licensed new technology to optimize the manufacturing process from the Yeda Research and Development Company Limited. The technology was developed as a synthetic immune niche technology. The technology will support and accelerate the expansion and function of TILs,

11. | Autologous Cell-Based Vaccine for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We continue working on developing a cell-based vaccine platform for the prevention of viral diseases. The initial target for the platform is SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19). This cell-based vaccine platform utilizes an autologous approach. The goal is to enable the COVID-19 engineered cells will have the ability to activate an endogenous immune response and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular response.
 

12. | Bioxomes
----+---------

 
Exosomes are small, membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles implicated in cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes may serve as a valuable therapeutic modality because of their ability to transfer a wide variety of therapeutic payloads among cells that can influence a cell in multiple ways, and they can be designed to reach specific cell types. Natural cell membranes (biomimetics) have recently emerged as a new source of materials for molecular delivery systems. Because cell membrane-derived vesicles contain the intrinsic functionalities and signaling networks of their parent cells, they can overcome various obstacles encountered by synthetic liposomes in vivo (including immunogenecity concerns)
 
To this end, we have developed a proprietary manufacturing process for preparation of the natural exosome-mimetic/liposome, termed BioxomeTM, a large-scale GMP-compatible production protocol that will potentially allow us to obtain Bioxome from various cell types, including human adipose cells, fibroblasts, blood cells, as well as plant cells. Various therapeutic cargos (including modified mRNA) can be encapsulated into the Bioxome during its manufacture. Once injected systemically, Bioxomes naturally fuse with the cell membrane and release therapeutic cargo.
 
In 2021, we assessed Bioxome biodistribution of the non-loaded Bioxome upon its systemic administration in rodents. This study had demonstrated a rapid and preferential uptake of the Bioxome by the liver, followed (to a lesser extent) by the kidney and lungs. Further biodistribution studies with Bioxome-encapsulated RNAse and Bioxome-encapsulated mRNA are planned for 2022.
 
In addition, accelerated anti-COVID19 efficacy was demonstrated for Bioxome-incorporated Ranprinase in an in vitro COVID-19 infection model, and we will conduct further studies to determine if Bioxome can be a vehicle for effective delivery of antiviral compounds.
 

13. | .Mesenchymal stem cell Psoriasis (“MSCP”) 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are developing a personalized cell-based therapy product for wound healing and psoriasis. The product is based on allogeneic Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs). Following expansion, the ADSCs are used for the extraction of BioxomeTM. We have established a process for encapsulation of Topiramate, a well-known substrate used in other indications, during the Bioxome manufacture. The Bioxome-encapsulated Topiramate (Biox-Top) will be further formulated in commercially available hyaluronic acid (HA), a well-known dermal filler, for topical application. Regulatory approval is required for this process.
 
The developed manufacture-encapsulation protocol is currently being scaled-up for the future production of the clinical grade Biox-Top for topical administration.
 
Promising anti-inflammatory efficacy of the Biox-Top was demonstrated in the human skin explants that were subjected to inflammation.
 
After demonstrating in vivo efficacy in the animal models of psoriasis, we plan to further advance this product to clinical development.

14. | Muscle-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Human Regenerative Medicine 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An innovative and patented technology licensed from a licensing partner that enables the isolation of pluripotent adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) from a minimally invasive muscle micro-biopsy. The isolated autologously undifferentiated muscle-derived MSCs are developed for local administration into the muscle to correct muscle-related clinical indications, such as Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI).
 
In 2021, promising results were obtained in an in-vivo model of SUI demonstrating robust therapeutic efficacy of locally injected human muscle-derived MSCs (MD-MSCs) in reversing the development of SUI in nude rats. Moreover, both nerve regeneration and functional restoration of the muscle tissue was observed.
 
In addition, we are working to establish the regulatory path and are preparing all relevant documentation for potential clinical implementation of MD-MSCs.
 

15. | Kidney Disease 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
We are also developing multiple proprietary cell and cell derived products therapies for treating kidney failure and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). We have made progress in the establishment of the enrichment process of extracellular vesicles (EV) replacement therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
 

16. | KT-DM-103 and KT-CP-203 (3D-Printed Pancreatic Islets) 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We, through our Koligo acquisition, have exclusively licensed patents and technology from the University of Louisville Research Foundation related to the revascularization and 3D printing of cell and tissue for transplant (“3D-V” technology platform). We are developing this technology for potential autologous and allogeneic pancreatic islet transplant to treat type 1 diabetes (KT-DM-103) and chronic pancreatitis (KT-CP-203). The 3D-V technology platform may also support improved transplantation of other cell and tissue types in additional to pancreatic islets.
 
POCare Platform Strategy
 


13
--

 

Our aim is to provide a pathway to bring ATMPs in the cell and gene therapy industry from research to patients worldwide through our POCare Platform. We define point of care as a process of collecting, processing, and administering cells as close as possible to the clinical setting. We believe that this approach is an attractive proposition for personalized medicine because of our strategic partnerships with suppliers that help us to customize closed systems into effective mobile clean room facilities. This will potentially help to minimize or eliminate the need for cell transportation, which is a high-risk and costly aspect of the supply chain, further allowing flexible production and patient treatment.
 
The POCare Platform is a unique globally harmonized and decentralized CGT-processing infrastructure that offers cost-effective processing capacities with ease for scalability and reproducibility. By producing personalized cell and gene therapies (CGTs) at the point of care, we are able to add new capacity within months instead of years.
 
Local decentralization: POCare Centers are set up in preferred regions, based on nearby hospitals’ capacity needs, and support the POCare model by providing POCare Services for the POCare Network.
 
Global harmonization: the POCare Platform overcomes conventional processing challenges by enabling high quality standards and sterile, scalable onsite processing of CGTs orchestrated by the POCare centers to service local hospitals. Processing infrastructure is harmonized and reproducible using the Orgenesis Mobile Processing Unit and Lab technology (“OMPUL”). The use of an OMPUL can shorten implementation time from approximately 18-24 months to approximately 3-9 months, offers a more cost-effective environment and enables local scalability by connecting additional OMPULs. The network structure is supported and connected by the centralization of the harmonized best industry practices and standards to meet the highest quality standards (“QMS”, Quality Management System). Further global harmonization is implemented through standardization of the training programs, centralized data management and a unified supply chain.
 
OMPULization of therapies: strong process development capabilities are critical for any CGT to scale. All therapeutic candidates must undergo some level of process development to move from the discovery phase to the clinical phase, if only to establish the same protocols under GMP. The POCare Platform takes process development to the next level, implementing a process we call OMPULization. OMPULization includes unitizing the process to the exact specifications of the OMPUL so it can be rapidly implemented in OMPULs around the world. In addition, OMPULization incorporates the latest technology solutions to close and automate the process whenever possible.
 
Integrated closed and automated processing systems require fewer Full Time Employees (“FTEs”) to produce GMP batches, resulting in lower COGs and a process that has the ability to scale in sync with market demand. Full automation may not be necessary for all clinical phases, but it is important to plan for future incorporation. To this end, we have invested time and capital into evaluating relevant technology for CGT processing and have developed proprietary equipment that did not exist in the marketplace.
 
We aim to build value in various aspects of our company ranging from supply related processes including development and distribution systems, clinical and regulatory services, engineering and devices such as OMPULs discussed below, delivery systems, therapies including immuno-oncology, anti-aging, anti-viral, metabolic, nephrology, dermatology, orthopedic, as well as regenerative technologies.
 
Over time, we have worked to develop and validate POCare Technologies that can be combined within mobile production units for advanced therapies.
 
We have made significant investments in the development of several types of OMPULs and have made significant progress in the validation, risk analysis, regulatory and other related tasks relating to the OMPULs. We anticipate distributing and using the OMPULs through our POCare Network of partners, collaborators, and regional partners. OMPULs are designed for the purpose of validation, development, performance of clinical trials, manufacturing and/or processing of potential or approved cell and gene therapy products in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner at the point of care, as well as the manufacturing of such CGTs in a consistent and standardized manner in all locations. The design delivers a potential industrial solution for us to deliver CGTs to most clinical institutions at the point of care.

We have finalized or are in the process of finalizing the development of several POCare centers and, with the assistance of our partners, we are adapting the local requirements of each partner with the target of achieving a capacity to process and supply CGTs per our existing manufacturing contracts. As we expand operations, we expect that the OMPUL setup costs will decline over time. Most of our POC revenue to date is in support of the implementation of our technologies and therapies in our partners’ POC activities, which we expect will be the basis for future royalties and supply revenues.
 
We have embarked on a strategy of collaborative arrangements with strategically situated regional distributor partners around the world. We believe that these partners have the expertise, experience and strategic location to advance our POCare Platform.

Notable 2021 Activities 
 
In 2021, we have focused on setting up our regional POCare activities. This included the setup of POCare Centers that oversee regional development and GMP services, local OMPUL deployment and supply of products to the local clinical centers. We are in the process of setting up POCare Centers in Maryland, Boston, California, Belgium, Greece, Slovenia, Israel, Italy, Spain and Korea. Future set-up plans include potential sites in the U.S. and EU where we already have initial activity such as in Germany and Texas, as well as in Australia and China.
 
As part of our POCare Services, we have developed the relevant GMP processes for a variety of therapies such as CAR-T, TILs, NK and MSC based therapies. We have developed OMPULs with the required systems for production of CAR-T, TILs and MSC products, and are working on several other therapies intended for clinical testing.
 
We have worked closely with technology partners to adapt various systems for closed system production of the above products and continue our collaboration efforts to develop fully automated systems for integration in the OMPULs.
 
We expanded our collaboration with UC Davis and have completed the first production batch of GMP grade lentivirus to be utilized for clinical grade production of CAR-Ts. We have expanded our partnership with Johns Hopkins University and are setting up a GMP facility with the support of a grant from Maryland. We are providing products to several hospitals in the U.S., are working closely with leading hospitals in Spain and Italy and are working closely with clinicians from hospitals in Israel, where we have deployed our OMPULs to set up additional clinical sites where we can provide POCare Services for our customers and partners. Based on the requests of our customers and partners, we have expanded our POCare Services to include CRO services.
 
We have collaborated closely with our Greek partner, Theracell, and have set up a partnership in Greece focusing on delivering advanced therapies to Greek hospitals. The Greek government has granted our Greek joint venture entity a “fast track” status and a supportive financial grant.
 
Our POCare Services are expanding to additional geographies, and we are providing services to the U.S., EU, and Asia.
 
Revenue Model, Business Development and Licenses 
 
The Orgenesis Point of Care (POCare) Platform is comprised of three enabling components: a multitude of licensed cell based POCare Therapeutics to be produced in closed, automated POCare Technology systems across a collaborative POCare Network. Our therapies include, but are not limited to, autologous, cell-based immunotherapies, therapeutics for metabolic diseases, anti-viral diseases, and tissue regeneration. We are establishing and positioning the business to bring point-of-care therapies to patients in a scalable way working directly with hospitals and through regional JV partners and JVs active in autologous cell therapy product development, including facilities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. The POCare Platform’s goal is to enable a rapid, globally harmonized pathway for these therapies to reach large numbers of patients at lowered costs through efficient, and decentralized production. The POCare Network brings together industry partners, research institutes and hospitals worldwide to achieve harmonized, regulated clinical development and production of the therapies.

We are focused on technology in licensing and therapeutic collaborations, and we out license therapies marketing rights and manufacturing rights to partners and/or to the JVs. In many cases, the JVs are responsible for the preparation of clinical trials, local regulatory approvals and regional marketing activities. Such licensing includes exclusive or nonexclusive, sublicensable, royalty bearing rights and license to the Orgenesis Background IP as required to manufacture, distribute and market and sell Orgenesis products within the relevant territories. In consideration of the rights and the licenses so granted, we receive a royalty in the range of ten percent of the net sales generated by the JV Entity and/or its sublicensees (as applicable) with respect to the Orgenesis products.
 
In addition, in many cases, once the JV entities become profitable, we are entitled (in addition to any of its rights as holder of the JV Entity and prior to any other distributions of dividends by the JV Entity to shareholders of the JV Entity) and in addition to any royalties to which we may be entitled pursuant to a Orgenesis License Agreement, to receive from the JV entity royalties at a range of 10 to 15 percent of the JV entity’s audited US GAAP profit after tax.
 
Further to revenues generated from out licenses we generate revenues from POCare Services and sales which is comprised of:
 

● | R&D services provided to out-licensing partners 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have signed POCare Master Services Agreements (“MSAs”) with our JV partners. In terms of the MSAs, we provide certain broadly defined development services that relate to our licensed therapies designed to develop or enhance the therapy with the objective of preparing it for clinical use. Such services, per therapy, include regulatory services, pre-clinical studies, intellectual property services, development services, and GMP process translation. We also provide support services to our customers.
 

● | Hospital supply 
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
Hospital services includes the sale or lease of products and the performance of processing services to our POCare hospitals or other medical providers. We either work directly with hospitals or receive payments through our regional JV partnerships.
 

● | Cell process development revenue 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We provide cell process development services in some regions to third party customers. Those services are unique to the customers who retain the ownership of the intellectual property created through the process.

Competition in the Cell Therapy Field
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. There is continuous demand for innovation and speed, and as the cell-based therapies market evolves, there is always the risk that a competitor may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results for indications. Potential competition includes major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations with established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Currently, we are not aware of any other companies pursuing a business model similar to what we are developing under our POCare Platform. However, our competitors in the CGT field who are significantly larger and better capitalized than us could undertake strategies similar to what we are pursuing and even develop them at a much more rapid rate. These potential competitors include the same multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions that are operating in the CGT field. In that respect, smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable claims of our patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
In addition, we own or have exclusive rights to thirty-two (32) United States patents, fifty-seven (57) foreign-issued patents, twenty-six (26) pending patent applications in the United States, fifty-four (54) pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea, and six (6) international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications.

Government Regulation
 
Development Business
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products, where our OMPULs are established or where we plan to supply products. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with GMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, facility registration or licensing, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation in Israel and South Korea. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.
 
Our and our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction in the countries in which our and our customers’ products are intended to be marketed may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities or OMPULs are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGTPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. In addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.

Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 
Our development operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our contract manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Therapies and Product Candidates — Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations.
 
POCare Therapies Portfolio
 
Our therapeutic portfolio pipeline is diverse and addresses various unmet clinical needs. It is predominantly comprised of personalized autologous cell therapies, implying that patients receive cells that originate from their own body, virtually eliminating the risk of an immune response and rejection and thus easing various regulatory hurdles. In addition, by leveraging Orgenesis’ vast experience and proven track record in developing and optimizing cell processing, these selective therapies are adapted to be produced in closed, automated systems, reducing the need for high grade cleanroom environments. The systems enable each stage of the manufacturing process (cell sorting, expansion, genetic modifications, quality control) to be optimized in order to substantially reduce the cost burden for patients and making the therapies widely accessible. Notably, our therapeutic pipeline is developed by researchers from our network and are subsequently out-licensed and validated in multi-center clinical trials conducted across point of care partner sites leveraging the robustness of the Orgenesis network. Once approved these therapies are distributed to leading medical institutions globally within our network and thus granting the inventors a royalty-based commercialization horizon.
Regulatory Process in the United States
 Our potential product candidates are subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or licensure of a new biological product:

● | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can start; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce biologic drug candidates into humans in clinical trials; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with current GMP regulations and standards; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing that includes adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended uses; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with GMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. The FDA may also require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products or place other conditions on the approvals.

Regulatory Process in Europe
 
In the European Union (“EU”) somatic cell and gene therapy products are called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMPs). Since January 2022 the Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) 536/2014 regulates the application of medicinal products including ATMPs to humans immediately effective in all member states. In conjunction with Regulation 536/2014 the EU commission has released two delegated acts regulating manufacturing of investigational as well as marketed AMPs. For products that are regulated as an ATMP, the EU Regulation requires:

● | Compliance with current GMP regulations and standards, as described in the delegated acts 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Filing a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in EU member states and EEA countries according to regulation 536/2014 via CTIS (Clinical Trial Information System) allowing a harmonized approval process among all member states (including multinational clinical trials)

As in the U.S., prior to the general regulatory process of a new biologic products, we will prosecute an Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of patients with Established “Diabetes Mellitus” (“DM”) Induced by Total pancreatectomy. In the EU, in order to be qualified, the prevalence must be below 5 per 10,000 of the EU population, except where the expected return on investment is insufficient to justify the investment.
 
Authorized orphan medicines benefit from 10 years of protection from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved. Companies applying for designated orphan medicines pay reduced fees for regulatory activities. This includes reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing-authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.
 
Exemption from the centralized procedure was introduced into the ATMP Regulation to allow marketing of certain ATMPs in individual EU member states. The so-called “hospital exemption” can only be applied for custom-made ATMPs used in a hospital setting for a specific patient by a treating physician. In addition, a competent authority must authorize hospital exemption for ATMPs. Hospital exemption products must comply with the same national requirements concerning quality, traceability and pharmacovigilance that apply to authorized medicinal products. The “hospital exemption” has to be applied for individually in each EU member state according to national procedures and control measures.

Clinical Trials
 
Typically, both in the U.S. and the EU, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, the FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, as well as clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA or EMA.
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for our AIP cells as a cell replacement therapy for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia-prone diabetes resulting from TP due to chronic pancreatitis. The FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation Program provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives, including eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity upon regulatory approval, exemption from FDA application fees, tax credits for qualified clinical trials, and other potential assistance in the drug development process.
