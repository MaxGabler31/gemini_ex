--------+---------

OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation. Our focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic, which is a leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for approximately six million deaths annually worldwide. 
 Cytisine is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma AD for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014, respectively.  
 Cytisine is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic binding to nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking through antagonistic properties. The cytisine dosing schedule reflects that of an anti-addiction medication, with downward dose titration over a period of 25 days. 
 In late June 2017, we filed our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for cytisine with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which included National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, sponsored non-clinical studies. The IND was accepted in late July 2017.
 
In August 2017, we initiated a study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisine in fed and fasted subjects. 
 In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose Pharmacokinetics, or PK, and Pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine in 36 healthy volunteer smokers aged 18-65 years when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. Preliminary results on 24 smokers were announced in February 2018. The PK results indicated expected increases in plasma concentration with higher doses of cytisine. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, however, 58% of the subjects in the trial achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Half (6/12) of the subjects on the 1.5mg arm and 67% (8/12) of the subjects on the 3.0mg arm achieved abstinence on day 26. Subjects who did not achieve abstinence had a significant reduction in number of daily cigarettes smoked by day 26. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No serious adverse events were observed in the study. 
 In December 2017, we submitted a meeting request to hold a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA to review our Phase 3 program and overall development plans for cytisine. We received confirmation from the FDA for a meeting date in the second quarter of 2018. We intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical program in mid-2018, subject to FDA guidance and the availability of capital. In addition to the Phase 3 program, we expect to run additional supportive clinical studies including, but not limited to urinary excretion of cytisine, renal impairment and QT interval prolongation studies as well as supportive New Drug Application, or NDA, non-clinical chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. 
 While third party trials of cytisine have been conducted that may inform future Company-sponsored clinical trials, we have not yet conducted any large scale company-sponsored clinical trials for cytisine in the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Our management team has significant experience in growing emerging companies focused on the development of under-utilized pharmaceutical compounds to meet unmet medical needs. We intend to use this experience to develop and ultimately commercialize cytisine either directly or via strategic collaborations.
 Recent Corporate History
 On August 1, 2017, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or OncoGenex, completed a transaction, or the Arrangement, with Achieve Life Science, Inc., or Achieve, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement between Achieve and OncoGenex dated January 5, 2017, or the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, OncoGenex changed its name to Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., instituted an one-for-eleven reverse stock split, issued 8,210,118 shares of its common stock (after accounting for the elimination of resulting fractional shares) in exchange for all of the outstanding preferred shares, common shares and convertible debentures of Achieve, and as a result Achieve became a wholly-owned subsidiary of OncoGenex, and is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol ACHV. More information concerning the Arrangement is contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2017 and our Amendment No. 3 to the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on June 6, 2017.
 The financial results account for the Arrangement between OncoGenex and Achieve as a reverse merger, whereby Achieve is deemed to be the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective. Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the results of operations of only Achieve for the time period of January 1, 2017 through August 1, 2017 and include the results of the combined company following the completion of the Arrangement on August 1, 2017. The consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include only the consolidated results of operations of Achieve and do not include historical results of OncoGenex. This treatment and presentation is in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations”. Information relating to the number of shares, price per share and per share amounts of common stock are presented on a post- reverse stock split basis, as a reverse stock split in the ratio of one-for-eleven was effected in connection with the Arrangement.
 We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net loss was $10.6 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million for years end December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $12.7 million, cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.3 million and a positive working capital balance of $3.7 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred from general and administrative costs associated with our operations and research and development costs from our clinical development programs. 
 Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, cytisine and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected.
 Our current capital resources are insufficient to fund our planned operations for the next 12 months. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations, from the sale of our securities, partnering arrangements or other financing transactions in order to finance the commercialization of our product candidates. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, will have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidate.
 The accompanying financial results have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial results do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. 
 Product Candidate Overview
 Our product candidate, cytisine, is a naturally occurring plant-based alkyloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is a smoking cessation aid that interacts with nicotine receptors in the brain and is believed to help reduce the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking.

Cytisine is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by a third party for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014. 
 Apatorsen
 In August 2017, we discontinued further development of apatorsen. We provided a notice of discontinuance to our former development partners for apatorsen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, and a letter of termination to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, notifying them that we have discontinued development of apatorsen resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to this product candidate. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the apatorsen patents and patent applications, under all apatorsen related agreements with Ionis and UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. 
OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE - CYTISINE
 Overview of Cytisine
 Our product candidate, cytisine, is a naturally occurring plant-based alkyloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is a smoking cessation aid that interacts with nicotine receptors in the brain and is believed to help reduce the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. 
 Cytisine is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by a third party for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014. TabexTM is currently marketed in a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in other geographic regions, as Over-the-Counter drug, or OTC.
 Cytisine Mechanism of Action
 Cytisine is a partial agonist that binds with high affinity to the alpha-4 beta-2, or a4b2, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Through dual-acting partial agonist/partial antagonist activity, cytisine is believed to help reduce nicotine cravings, withdrawal symptoms and reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. The  a4b2 nicotinic receptor is a well-understood target in addiction. When nicotine binds to this receptor, it causes dopamine to be released in the mid brain, reinforcing the dopamine reward system. This receptor has been implicated in the development and maintenance of nicotine dependence. Cytisine is believed to act as a partial agonist at the  a4b2 nicotinic receptor, preventing nicotine from binding and releasing dopamine. 
 Cytisine Opportunity
 
We have an exclusive license and supply agreement with Sopharma for the development and commercialization of cytisine outside of Sopharma’s territory, which consists of certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam. We intend to develop and commercialize cytisine in the United States and intend thereafter to target other markets outside of Sopharma’s territory, such as Western Europe, Japan, Australasia, Southeast Asia and Latin and South America.
 We are developing cytisine as an aid to smoking cessation and nicotine dependence to address the limitations of both prescription drugs and OTC products. We believe that a substantial market exists in the United States, European Union, or EU, and the rest of the world for a safe and effective smoking cessation treatment. Increasingly constrained healthcare budgets have focused government attention on drug pricing, which we believe cytisine can address by serving as a cost-effective alternative to existing treatments, with the potential for better efficacy than nicotine replacement therapies, or NRTs, and a potentially superior side effect profile than existing prescription smoking cessation products. Our goal is to obtain approval from the FDA and from other regulatory agencies for the sale and distribution of cytisine in the United States and subsequently to other countries outside of Sopharma’s territory.
 We have met with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and with other national regulatory authorities in Europe to identify the steps required for the approval of cytisine. The FDA requested results from non-clinical studies, additional human 
 5


pharmacokinetic studies and adequate demonstration of safety and efficacy from randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 The non-clinical studies requested by the FDA have been sponsored and completed by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, in addition to the National Cancer Institute. In July 2017, we filed our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for cytisine with the FDA, which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. The IND was accepted in late July 2017.
 
In August 2017, we initiated a study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisine in fed and fasted subjects. 
 In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose Pharmacokinetics, or PK, and Pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine in 36 healthy volunteer smokers aged 18-65 years when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. Preliminary results on 24 smokers were announced in February 2018. The PK results indicated expected increases in plasma concentration with higher doses of cytisine. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, however, 58% of the subjects in the trial achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Half (6/12) of the subjects on the 1.5mg arm and 67% (8/12) of the subjects on the 3.0mg arm achieved abstinence on day 26. Subjects who did not achieve abstinence had a significant reduction in number of daily cigarettes smoked by day 26. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No serious adverse events were observed in the study. 
 In December 2017, we initiated a number of in vitro drug to drug interaction studies of cytisine and expect data from these studies to be available in the first half of 2018. Also in December 2017, we submitted a meeting request to hold a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA to review our Phase 3 program and overall development plans for cytisine. We received confirmation from the FDA for a meeting date in the second quarter of 2018. We intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical program in mid-2018, subject to FDA guidance and the availability of capital. In addition to the Phase 3 program, we expect to run additional supportive clinical studies including, but not limited to urine excretion, renal impairment and QT interval prolongation studies as well as supportive NDA non-clinical chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. 
 While third party trials of cytisine have been conducted that may inform future Company-sponsored clinical trials, we have not yet conducted any large scale company-sponsored clinical trials for cytisine in the United States or any other jurisdiction.
 Cytisine Clinical Trials
 Cytisine has been tested in two large, randomized Phase 3 clinical trials conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, in more than 2,000 participants. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cytisine according to current clinical development standards.
 TASC Trial
 The Tabex Smoking Cessation, or TASC, trial, was sponsored by the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies and evaluated cytisine versus placebo in 740 primarily moderate-to-heavy smokers treated for 25 days in a single center in Warsaw, Poland. The primary outcome measure was sustained, biochemically verified smoking abstinence for 12 months after the end of treatment. The TASC trial was conceived by Professor Robert West (Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London) and was funded by the a grant from the National Prevention Research Initiative, including contributions from Cancer Research UK, Medical Research Council, United Kingdom Department of Health and others. We, through our partner Sopharma, provided the study drug used in this trial.
 
The results of the TASC trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011. The rate of sustained 12-month abstinence was 8.4% in the cytisine arm as compared with 2.4% in the placebo group (p=0.001). These results showed that cytisine was 3.4 times more likely than a placebo to help participants stop smoking and remain non-smokers for one year. The rate of sustained 6-month abstinence was 10.0% in the cytisine arm as compared with 3.5% in the placebo group (p<0.001). Cytisine was well tolerated with a slight but significant increase in combined gastrointestinal adverse events (upper abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia and dry mouth; cytisine 51/370 (13.8%) and placebo 30/370 (8.1%). The safety profile of cytisine was similar to that of a placebo with no other significant differences in the rate of side effects in the two trial arms.
 A summary of adverse events reported in 10 or more subjects in the TASC trial is included in the table below.

(1) | The incidence of events was analyzed according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Class, or SOC, categorization and preferred terms. Participants who reported more than one event in a system category were counted only once for the category. SOC categories for other events (those reported by fewer than 10 participants) were as follows: general (five events within cytisine and five with placebo), cardiac (four with cytisine and two with placebo), musculoskeletal and connective tissue (three with cytisine and three with placebo), infections (one with placebo), immune system (one with placebo) and metabolism and nutrition (one with placebo).

 CASCAID Trial
 The second Phase 3 trial, the Cytisine As a Smoking Cessation Aid, or CASCAID, non-inferiority trial, was an open-label trial that randomized 1,310 adult daily smokers. Patients were randomized to receive either cytisine for 25 days or NRT for 8 weeks. Both treatment groups were offered low intensity telephone behavioral support during trial treatment. The primary outcome measure was continuous self-reported abstinence from smoking one month after quit date. The CASCAID trial was conducted by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. We, through our partner Sopharma, provided the cytisine in form of commercial TabexTM used in this trial.
 The results of the CASCAID trial, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine  in December 2014, showed that cytisine was superior to NRT for smoking cessation and, specifically, that cytisine was 1.43 times more likely than nicotine gums or patches to help participants stop smoking and remain non-smokers for six months. The rate of continuous one-month abstinence was 40% in the cytisine arm as compared with 31% in the NRT arm (p<0.001). A secondary outcome included the rate of continuous six-month abstinence which was 22% in the cytisine arm as compared with 15% in the NRT arm (p=0.002). Cytisine was generally well tolerated, although self-reported adverse events were slightly higher in the cytisine arm compared with the NRT arm. The most frequent adverse events for cytisine were nausea and vomiting (30/665 (4.6%)) and sleep disorders (28/665 (4.2%)). Reports of these same adverse events in the NRT arm were as follows: nausea and vomiting (2/655 (0.3%)) and sleep disorders (2/655 (0.3%)). 
 
A summary of adverse events reported in subjects in the CASCAID trial is included in the table below.

In the NRT group, compliance was defined as having used NRT at 1 week and 1 month after the quit date. It was assumed that participants with missing data were not compliant. 
(2) | A serious event was defined as death, a life-threatening event, an event requiring hospitalization, or otherwise medically important event (i.e., the event does not belong in any of the other categories but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent the occurrence of one or more other serious events).
(3) | The categories are mutually exclusive. 
(4) | The severity of events was not medically verified. 
(5) | The list of most frequent adverse events excludes signs and symptoms of cold and influenza. Adverse events were categorized in accordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , Tenth Revision (ICD-10), Australian Modification. 

Safety Reporting 
 As cytisine has been marketed in Central and Eastern Europe for over 20 years, substantial safety reporting exists for cytisine including over 15 million cases. The most recent periodic safety update report, PSUR, submitted to the European authorities by Sopharma in 2016 did not contain new safety signals with cytisine.
OVERVIEW OF MARKET AND TREATMENT 
 Overview of the Tobacco Epidemic
 The NIH and the World Health Organization, or WHO, estimated in January 2017 that approximately 1.1 billion people globally are smokers and that 6 million people die annually from diseases related to tobacco use including 600,000 from passive smoke. This figure is projected to grow to 8 million by 2030. Tobacco use is estimated to cause 12% of deaths among persons aged 30 years and over worldwide, including deaths from cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and lung diseases such as tuberculosis and lower respiratory tract infections. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is a direct cause of approximately 80% of lung cancer deaths and is linked to 30% of all cancers.
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, estimate that in 2015 approximately 15.1% of all U.S. adults (36.5 million people) were cigarette smokers. Smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death worldwide and in the United States.
 CDC estimates that the annual cost of smoking related illnesses in the United States is more than $300 billion annually in direct medical care and lost productivity. Over 16 million people in the United States are living with a disease caused by smoking. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis.
 Tobacco smoking is highly addictive and research suggests that nicotine may be as addictive as heroin, cocaine or alcohol.  The CDC estimates that more people are addicted to nicotine than any other drug and report that nearly 70% of smokers desire to quit and 55% make a quit attempt each year. Despite the high number of attempts, only about 4% to 7% of people are successful in their quit attempt each year. 
 The Global Smoking Cessation Market
 8


Coherent Market Insights Report “Smoking Cessation and Nicotine De-addiction Products Market, 2016-2017” estimated that global revenues for smoking cessation and nicotine de-addiction products in 2016 was approximately $12.8 billion including NRT, e-cigarettes and drug therapy. In 2017, in the U.S. alone, sales for NRT and drug therapy were estimated to be $3.8 billion and is expected to grow to $5.7 billion by 2024. 
 Two prescription oral treatments for smoking cessation are currently available in the United States: Chantix® (varenicline) marketed by Pfizer and Zyban ® (bupropion) marketed by GlaxoSmithKline (as well as generic manufacturers). Both of these prescription treatments have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, however, both are also associated with significant side effects. Chantix’s labeling indicates elevated instances of nausea, abnormal dreams, constipation, flatulence and vomiting may be experienced by Chantix-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients, and Zyban’s labeling discloses potential adverse reactions including insomnia, rhinitis, dry mouth, dizziness, nervous disturbance, anxiety, nausea, constipation, arthralgia and seizures.
 The vast majority of OTC smoking cessation aids are NRTs. NRTs come in many forms, including gums, lozenges and patches, and although they are marketed at a lower price point, they have been shown to be less effective than prescription drugs. For example, a Cochrane Group independent database review of nicotine receptor partial agonists published in 2016 compared varenicline (Chantix) with a number of NRTs and found that varenicline appeared to be more effective than the NRTs.
 
LICENSE & SUPPLY AGREEMENTS 
 Sopharma AD 
 In 2009 and 2010, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sopharma License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Sopharma Supply Agreement, with Sopharma, AD, or Sopharma. Pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement, we were granted access to all available manufacturing, efficacy and safety data related to cytisine, as well as a granted patent in several European countries including Germany, France and Italy related to new oral dosage forms of cytisine providing enhanced stability. Additional rights granted under the Sopharma License Agreement include the exclusive use of, and the right to sublicense, the trademark Tabex in all territories—other than certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam, where Sopharma or its affiliates and agents already market Tabex—in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of products. Under the Sopharma License Agreement, we agreed to pay a nonrefundable license fee. In addition, we agreed to make certain royalty payments equal to a mid-teens percentage of all net sales of Tabex branded products in our territory during the term of the Sopharma License Agreement, including those sold by a third party pursuant to any sublicense which may be granted by us. We have agreed to cooperate with Sopharma in the defense against any actual or threatened infringement claims with respect to Tabex. Sopharma has the right to terminate the Sopharma License Agreement upon the termination or expiration of the Sopharma Supply Agreement. The Sopharma License Agreement will also terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency and material breach. To date, we have paid Sopharma $10 pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement. 
 A cross-license exists between us and Sopharma whereby we grant to Sopharma rights to any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights filed by us in Sopharma territories. 
 On May 14, 2015, we and Sopharma entered into an amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement. Among other things, the amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement reduced the royalty payments payable by us to Sopharma from a percentage in the mid-teens to a percentage in the mid-single digits and extended the term of the Sopharma License Agreement until May 26, 2029. 
 On July 28, 2017, we and Sopharma entered into the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement, we will exclusively purchase all of our cytisine from Sopharma, Sopharma agrees to exclusively supply all such cytisine requested by us, for territories as detailed in the licensing agreement, and we extended the term to 2037. In addition, we will have full access to the cytisine supply chain and Sopharma will manufacture sufficient cytisine to meet a forecast for a specified demand of cytisine for the five years commencing shortly after the commencement of the agreement, with the forecast to be updated regularly thereafter. We and Sopharma may terminate the Sopharma Supply Agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency. 
 University of Bristol 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Bristol, or the University of Bristol License Agreement. Under the University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from the University of Bristol to certain patent and technology rights resulting from research activities into cytisine and its derivatives, including a number of patent applications related to novel approaches to cytisine binding at the nicotinic receptor level. Any patents issued in connection with these applications would be scheduled to expire on February 5, 2036 at the earliest. 
 9


In consideration of rights granted by the University of Bristol, we paid a nominal license fee and agreed to pay amounts of up to $3.2 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the University of Bristol License Agreement. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize product candidates subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. 
 On January 22, 2018, we and the University of Bristol entered into an amendment to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Pursuant to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement we received exclusive rights for all human medicinal uses of cytisine across all therapeutic categories from the University of Bristol from research activities into cytisine and its derivatives. In consideration of rights granted by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we agreed to pay an initial amount of $37,500 upon the execution of the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, and additional amounts of up to $1.7 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, in addition to amounts under the original University of Bristol License Agreement of up to $3.2 million in the aggregate, tied to specific financing, development and commercialization milestones. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement or to the original University of Bristol License Agreement, we will be responsible, as provided in the original University of Bristol License Agreement, for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. To date, we have paid the University of Bristol $50,000 pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement.
 Unless otherwise terminated, the University of Bristol License Agreement will continue until the earlier of July 2036 or the expiration of the last patent claim subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement. We may terminate the University of Bristol License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days’ prior notice to the University of Bristol. The University of Bristol License Agreement will terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency or its material breach of the agreement. Under the terms of the University of Bristol License Agreement, we had provided 100 grams of cytisine to the University of Bristol as an initial contribution. To date, we have not paid any further sums to the University of Bristol pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement. 
 Summary of Milestone Obligations by Product Candidate 
 The following table sets forth the milestones that we may be required to pay to third parties under the license agreements described above. As described above, we will also be required to pay certain revenue-based royalties with respect to our product candidate.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 We are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate In the United States, the principal regulating authority is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of product candidates and research, quality, manufacturing processes, product approval and promotion, advertising and product labeling. In the EU, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national regulatory agencies regulate the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of product candidates, and over-see the procedures for approval of drugs for the EU and European Economic Area countries. In Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical trials, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates prices. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA, before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval.
United States
 We intend to focus initially on clinical development of cytisine in the United States. It is anticipated that cytisine tablets would receive a minimum five years of data exclusivity under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 Before a new pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States, the FDA must approve an NDA, for a new drug. The steps required before the FDA will approve an NDA generally include non-clinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical 
 10


trials conducted by the trial sponsor; sponsor submission of the NDA application to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured.
 As a condition of product approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical trials, known as Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product. The FDA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market trials and programs. Any modifications to a drug, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental NDA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we generate additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
 Sales and Marketing. The marketing practices of U.S. pharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The U.S. federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or medical device companies. These laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
 Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products will depend in part on government regulation. We will likely be required to offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. We will also be required to report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose us to penalties.
 In the United States, Medicaid currently covers all smoking cessation products including Chantix and Zyban. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, was passed, which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Section 2502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, specifies that tobacco cessation medications will be removed from the list of optional medications and required for inclusion in states’ prescription drug benefit. On May 2, 2014 the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, provided guidance into insurance coverage policy that health plans would be in compliance if they cover, among other items, screening for tobacco use, individual, group and phone counseling, all FDA approved tobacco cessation medications (both prescription and OTC) when prescribed by a healthcare provider, at least two quit attempts per year, four sessions of counseling and 90 days of treatment, with no cost sharing (co-pay) required.
 Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments.
 11


Healthcare Reform. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry, such as:
 
 
• | increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care;


• | Requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap; and


• | Imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

 The ACA includes provisions designed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to additional individuals. Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions. Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products.
 On January 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order to initiate the repeal of the Health Care Reform Law and we expect that additional state and federal healthcare measures under the Trump administration will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for our product candidates, or additional pricing pressures. Currently, the Health Care Reform Law provides coverage for smoking cessation-related activities, including two counseling attempts for smoking cessation per year and prescription drugs for smoking cessation, but not OTC treatments. If these provisions are repealed, in whole or in part, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.
 Anti-Corruption. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.
 Outside the United States
 We expect to encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries in which we seek to develop and commercialize cytisine.
 New Drug Approvals and Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the EEA countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the EU and EEA than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country.
 In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the EU. Key changes include the establishment of a new Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee within the EMA, with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. It also introduces the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive.
 The United Kingdom, or UK, is currently a member state of the EU. However, the UK has signaled its intention to withdraw from the EU, which is commonly known as BREXIT. Following BREXIT, if it occurs, the UK would no longer be a member state within the EU. Since a significant portion of the regulatory framework in the UK is derived from the regulations of the EU, BREXIT could materially change the regulatory framework applicable to the approval of our product candidates and other aspects of our business in the UK, such as the pricing and importation of prescription products. However, at this time it is not known what new regulatory 
 12


framework will be in place to govern the review and approval of new medicines in the UK. Further, the EMA is currently located in the UK. It is possible that BREXIT will result in a relocation of the EMA or disruption to the EMA’s review process.
 Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the United States and Europe.
 CONTRACT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS 
 Our strategy is to outsource certain product development activities and have established contract research agreements for, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and some data management services. We choose which business or institution to use for these services based on their expertise, capacity and reputation and the cost of the service. 
 We also provide or have provided quantities of our product candidates to academic research institutions to investigate the mechanism of action and evaluate novel combinations of product candidates with other cancer therapies in various cancer indications. These collaborations expand our research activities for our product candidates with modest contribution from us. 
 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES 
 For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our expenditures for research and development activities were $3.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Such research and development expenses primarily related to the advancement of our product candidate cytisine. 
MANUFACTURING 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of cytisine, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on Sopharma as supplier and contract manufacturer for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product candidates for our clinical trials. Other than the Sopharma relationship, we do not have any current contractual arrangements for the manufacture of clinical or commercial supplies of cytisine. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our clinical manufacturing activities.
 Sopharma sources cytisine from the Laburnum anagyroides plant, a shrub or small tree native to, and widely distributed throughout, Bulgaria, south Central Europe and the northwestern Balkan Peninsula. The seed pods are harvested from the shrubs and dried. Sopharma currently has planted approximately 225 acres of Laburnum trees, saplings and seedlings in multiple locations in Central and Eastern Bulgaria and is in the process of planting another 150 acres. Sopharma plans to plant additional trees to manage supply for major markets. Each tree takes approximately four to five years to reach maturity for harvesting and has a productive life expectancy of 20 to 25 years. Seeds are harvested annually, dried and stored for processing into cytisine.  Laburnum seeds in their natural state are highly toxic and the extraction process removes the toxins to produce highly purified cytisine. Sopharma is stockpiling Laburnum seeds to meet the projected demand from us upon commercial launch.
 The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, manufacturing process utilizes a series of techniques including milling, solvent extraction, filtration and purification. Critical control steps and manufacturing intermediates have been identified and are controlled by internally developed specifications and methods to ensure a consistent and reproducible process. The highly purified cytisine is dried, sieved and packed for storage until further processing into drug product. The cytisine API manufacturing process has been developed and refined over many years of manufacture by Sopharma, which has significant expertise in manufacturing cytisine.
 Sopharma manufactures cytisine API in its facilities in Bulgaria, which are near the capital, Sofia. The API processing facility complies with EU cGMP requirements and has been inspected by the Bulgarian Drug Agency. 
 SALES AND MARKETING
 Our commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives. We intend to seek partners in territori
es where we have no commercial experience and intend to directly market in niche markets where a small cost-effective commercial capability can generate direct revenues.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 The U.S. Supreme Court has held that certain claims to naturally-occurring substances are not patentable. Cytisine is a naturally-occurring product and is therefore not patentable in the United States.  Furthermore, cytisine has been in use in other parts of the world for decades, and is not susceptible to patenting in its current form.
 Our development and commercialization of cytisine is protected by our exclusive supply agreement with Sopharma and Sopharma’s proprietary technology, experience and expertise in cytisine extraction. In addition, we intend to utilize market exclusivity laws including those under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States and exclusivity under Directive 2004/27/EC in the EU.
 
Additionally, we are actively building an intellectual property portfolio around our clinical-stage product candidate and research programs. A key component of this portfolio strategy is to seek international patent protection with patent applications in the UK and in major market countries that we consider important to the development of our business worldwide. As of December 31, 2017, we had a portfolio of two international PCT applications of six priority patent applications pending in the UK. This portfolio includes method of use, formulation and composition of matter patents on cytisine and derivatives thereof.
 
We intend to make further international patent submissions, including in the United States, all of which will take patent filing priority dates from the UK applications referred to above. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business.  We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. 
 
COMPETITION 
 The development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research institutions worldwide with respect to smoking cessation and other product candidates that it may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. We are aware that many companies have therapeutics marketed or in development for smoking cessation, including, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Novartis, Invion, Embera Neurotherapeutics, Redwood Scientific Technologies, 22nd Century Group, Quit4Good, Chrono Therapeutics, NAL Pharmaceuticals, Selecta Biosciences, Aradigm and others. We expect that our competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products in order to take advantage of the significant market opportunity.
Prescription Treatments
 To our knowledge, two oral prescription drugs for smoking cessation are currently available in the United States – Chantix and Zyban. Both have been proven effective in aiding smoking cessation, however, each is associated with a number of adverse effects.
 We believe that cytisine may have similar efficacy to Chantix with potential fewer adverse events and could be more cost-effective to patients. A Cochrane Group independent database review of nicotine receptor partial agonists published in 2016, or the Cochrane Report, compared cytisine with Chantix and found no apparent difference in efficacy between cytisine and Chantix, in that the database review found that the risk ratio for cytisine and Chantix was in the same order of magnitude. In addition, it should be noted that only two studies were used to calculate the risk ratio for cytisine versus 27 trials for varenicline, and that evidence for varenicline was considered of high and moderate quality while the evidence for cytisine was considered low quality. However, a head-to-head comparative trial of these two treatments has not been performed. Furthermore, a report by the National Institute of Health Research in the United Kingdom comparing Chantix and cytisine concluded that cytisine appears to be more clinically effective and cost effective than varenicline (Chantix) based on expected costs and quality-adjusted life-year, or QALY, values.
 The Cochrane Report researchers searched for randomized controlled trials testing varenicline, cytisine or dianicline, finding 39 studies of varenicline compared to placebo, bupropion or nicotine patches. The Cochrane Report researchers also found four trials of cytisine, one of which compared it to nicotine replacement therapy. The Cochrane Report also included one trial of dianicline, which is no longer in development, and so not available to use as a smoking cessation aid. To be included, trials had to report quit rates at 
 14


least six months from the start of treatment. The Cochrane Report preferred the strictest available definition of quitting, and focused on results which had been biochemically confirmed by testing blood or bodily fluids. The Cochrane Report researchers conducted full searches up to May 2015, although several key trials published after that date were also included. The first cytisine trial included in the Cochrane Report was conducted in 1971. Since there are only two phase 3 studies with cytisine, the researchers that conducted the meta analysis included in the Cochrane report determined that their meta analysis was of poor quality.
 Over-the-Counter Treatments
 The most common OTC treatments bought in pharmacies for smoking cessation in the United States and worldwide are NRTs such as nicotine patches, nicotine gums and nicotine lozenges. Each of these products delivers nicotine to the body although they generally do so at different rates and to different parts of the body than does a traditional cigarette. As concluded by the authors of several published clinical trials conducted by others, these therapies are generally less effective than prescription treatments. Recognized brands include Niquitin ® , Nicotinell ® , Nicorette ® and Nicoderm ® . Depending on the duration of treatment, the average cost of certain OTC smoking cessation treatments can exceed prescription treatments.
 Pharmaceutical companies, including larger companies in the industry, who have extensive expertise in pre-clinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for products, may develop other OTC treatments for smoking cessation. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors.
EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 13 employees, of whom five were engaged in research and development functions, including clinical development, regulatory affairs and manufacturing, and eight were engaged in general and administrative functions, including accounting and finance, administration, and corporate communications. 
 All of our employees have entered into non-disclosure agreements regarding our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppages. We believe that we maintain satisfactory relations with our employees. 
 From time to time, we also use outside consultants to provide advice on our clinical development plans, research programs, administration and potential acquisitions of new technologies. 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single reporting segment. Financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our total revenue and net loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and our total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
COMPANY INFORMATION 
 We were incorporated in California in October 1991 and subsequently reorganized as a Delaware corporation in March 1995. Our principal executive offices are located at 400 – 1001 W. Broadway Vancouver, B.C. V6H 4B1, and our telephone number is (604) 736-3678.
