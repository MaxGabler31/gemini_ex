ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
We are a leading provider of intelligent wireless solutions including mobile hotspots, routers, trackers, and other devices. Our designs integrate innovative hardware and software enabling machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our M2M and IoT solutions include embedded modules, modems and gateways built to deliver reliable always-on connectivity supporting a broad spectrum of applications based on fifth generation and fourth generation (5G/4G) wireless technology.
 
We have a majority ownership position in Franklin Technology Inc. ("FTI"), a research and development company located in Seoul, South Korea. FTI primarily provides design and development services to us for our wireless products.
 
Our products are generally marketed and sold directly to wireless operators, and indirectly through strategic partners and distributors. Our global customer base extends primarily from North America to the Caribbean and South America and Asia.
 
OUR STRUCTURE
 
We incorporated in 1982 in California and reincorporated in Nevada on January 2, 2008. The reincorporation had no effect on the nature of our business or our management. Our headquarters office is located in San Diego, California. The office is principally composed of marketing, sales, operations, finance and administrative support. It is responsible for all customer-related activities, such as marketing communications, product planning, product management and customer support, along with sales and business development activities on a worldwide basis.
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary with a majority voting interest of 66.3% (33.7% is owned by non-controlling interests) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the increase in the majority voting interest in percentage from 64.2% to 66.3% was due to the purchase by the Company of 43,333 shares of the subsidiary for $75,000 ($1.73 per share) from three non-controlling shareholders. The purchase decreased the non-controlling interests’ ownership percentage from 35.8% to 33.7%.  In the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the Company, intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated and net earnings are reduced by the portion of the net earnings of the subsidiary applicable to non-controlling interests.
 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. We identify our operating segments based on how our chief operating decision maker internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility.  We have one reportable segment, consisting of the sale of wireless access products. We generate revenues from three geographic areas, consisting of North America, the Caribbean and South America, and Asia. The following enterprise-wide disclosure is prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The following table contains certain financial information by geographic area:
