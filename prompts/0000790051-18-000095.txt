Item 1.  Business.
Overview

Carlisle Companies Incorporated's (“Carlisle”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) operations began in 1917, and is a diversified manufacturing company consisting of five segments that manufacture and distribute a broad range of products. Additional information is contained in Items 7 and 8. All references to "Notes" refer to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Our Company website is www.carlisle.com, through which we make available, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10‑K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q and Current Reports on Form 8‑K and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Business Strategy

We strive to be the market leader of highly‑engineered products in the various markets we serve. We are dedicated to achieving low‑cost positions and providing service excellence based on, among other things, superior quality, on‑time delivery and short cycle times.
The role of senior corporate management is to (i) allocate and manage capital, (ii) manage the Company’s portfolio of businesses including identifying acquisitions and businesses for divestiture in an effort to optimize the portfolio, (iii) evaluate and motivate segment management personnel and (iv) provide general management oversight and counsel.

The segment presidents are given considerable autonomy and have a significant level of independent responsibility for their businesses' operating performance. The Company believes that this structure encourages entrepreneurial action and enhances responsive decision making, thereby enabling each operation to better serve its customers and react quickly to its customers’ needs.

The Company utilizes its Carlisle Operating System (“COS”), a manufacturing structure and strategy deployment system based on lean enterprise and six sigma principles, to drive improving operational performance. COS is a continuous improvement process that defines the way the Company does business. Waste is eliminated and efficiencies are improved enterprise wide, allowing us to increase overall profitability. Improvements are not limited to production areas, as COS is also driving improvements in new product innovation, engineering, supply chain management, warranty and product rationalization. COS has created a culture of continuous improvement across all aspects of our business operations.

The Company has a long‑standing acquisition strategy. Traditionally, we have focused on strategic acquisitions or acquiring new businesses that can be added to existing operations. In addition, the Company considers acquiring new businesses that can operate independently from other Carlisle companies. Factors considered in making an acquisition include consolidation opportunities, technology, customer dispersion, operating capabilities and growth potential. We acquired four businesses during 2017, which complement our existing Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”) and Carlisle FoodService (“CFS”) segments. We also pursue the sale of a business when it is determined they no longer fit within the Company’s long‑term goals or strategy, and on February 1, 2018 announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell CFS to The Jordan Company for $750 million (refer to Note 20). 
For more details regarding acquisitions of the Company’s businesses during the past three years, refer to “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Acquisitions” and Note 3.

Description of Businesses by Segment

Carlisle Construction Materials (“CCM”)

The CCM segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing and selling thermoplastic polyolefin (“TPO”), ehtylene propylene diene monomer rubber (“EPDM”) and polyvinyl chloride (“PVC”) membrane and metal roofing systems. CCM also manufactures and distributes energy‑efficient rigid foam insulation panels for all roofing applications. Roofing materials and insulation are sold together in warranted systems or separately in non-warranted systems to the new construction, re-roofing and maintenance, general construction and industrial markets. The roofing materials, including insulation, are primarily sold under the SynTec, Versico and Hunter Panels product lines in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “United States”) and throughout the world and, in addition, the Resitrix and Hertalan product lines in Europe. The segment manufactures and sells liquid and spray‑applied waterproofing membranes, vapor and air barriers and HVAC duct sealants and hardware for the commercial and residential construction markets through its coatings and waterproofing operation. The segment manufactures block molded expanded polystyrene for a variety of end markets, predominantly roofing and waterproofing through its Insulfoam product line. The majority of CCM’s products are sold through a network of authorized sales representatives and distributors. On November 1, 2017, we acquired Accella Performance Materials LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and Accella Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together, “Accella”). Accella, operating through its subsidiaries, is a North American specialty polyurethanes platform, offering a broad range of polyurethane products and solutions across a broad diversity of markets and applications.
CCM operates manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States, its primary market, and in Germany, the Netherlands and Romania. Insulation facilities are located in New York, Illinois, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington. EPDM manufacturing operations are located in Pennsylvania, Illinois, the Netherlands and Germany. TPO facilities are located in Mississippi, Utah and Pennsylvania. Metal roofing facilities are located in Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Coatings and waterproofing manufacturing operations include four production facilities in North America and one in the United Kingdom. Block molded expanded polystyrene operations are located in eight production and fabrication facilities across the United States. CCM also has a PVC manufacturing plant in Illinois. CCM, through its Accella operations, presently has nine production facilities across the United States, as well as one in Germany.

Raw materials for this segment include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”), polyol, EPDM polymer, TPO polymer, carbon black, processing oils, solvents, asphalt, polyester fabric, black facer paper, oriented strand board, clay and various packaging materials. Critical raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply. The vendor typically has multiple processing facilities for raw materials that are single sourced.

Sales and earnings for CCM tend to be somewhat higher in the second and third quarters due to increased construction activity during those periods from favorable weather conditions.

The working capital practices for this segment include:


• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 45 days to 90 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.


CCM serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2017 CCM's largest distributor customer represented approximately 15% of this segment’s net sales, but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. On January 2, 2018, CCM's largest distribution customer completed a merger with another significant customer, and together would have represented 22% of CCM's 2017 net sales and 12% of the Company's consolidated net sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and operating income. Backlog orders are not considered a significant factor of CCM’s business and were $64.7 million and $46.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. All orders are reasonably expected to be filled in 2018.

This segment faces competition from numerous competitors that produce roofing, insulation and waterproofing products for commercial and residential applications. The level of competition within this market varies by product line. As one of four major manufacturers in the single‑ply industry, CCM competes through innovative products, long‑term warranties and customer service. CCM offers separately‑priced extended warranty contracts on certain of its products ranging from five years to 40 years, the most significant being those offered on its installed roofing systems, subject to certain exclusions, covers leaks in the roofing system attributable to a problem with the particular product or the installation of the product. The building owner must have the roofing system installed by an independent authorized roofing contractor trained by CCM to install its roofing systems in order to qualify for the warranty.

Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (“CIT”)

The CIT segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing and selling high‑performance wire, cable, connectors, contacts and cable assemblies and satellite communication equipment for the transfer of power and data primarily for the aerospace, medical, defense electronics, test and measurement equipment and select industrial markets. This segment operates manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and Mexico, with the United States, Europe and China being the primary target markets for sales. Sales are made by direct sales personnel and independent sales representatives.

Raw materials for this segment include gold, copper conductors that are plated with tin, nickel, or silver, polyimide tapes, polytetrafluoroethylene (“PTFE”) tapes, PTFE fine powder resin, thermoplastic resins, stainless steel, beryllium copper rod, machined metals, plastic parts and various marking and identification materials. Key raw materials are typically sourced worldwide and have at least two supplier sources to better assure adequate supply.

The working capital practices for this segment include:


• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand. The majority of CIT’s sales are from made‑to‑order products, resulting in inventories purchased on demand.


CIT serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2017 one customer represented approximately 10% of this segment’s net sales, but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and operating income. Backlog orders were $299.9 million and $217.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. Of the $299.9 million in backlog orders as of December 31, 2017, $11.3 million is not reasonably expected to be filled in 2018.

The CIT segment faces competition from numerous competitors within each of the markets it serves. While product specifications, certifications and life cycles vary by market, the CIT segment primarily positions itself to gain design specification for customer platforms or products with long life cycles and high barriers to entry, such as in the aerospace and medical markets that generally have high standards for product certification as deemed by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), respectively. The CIT segment competes primarily on the basis of its product performance and its ability to meet its customers’ highly specific design, engineering and delivery needs on a timely basis. Relative to many of its competitors that are large multi‑national corporations, the CIT segment retains the ability to remain agile and respond quickly to customer needs and market opportunities.

Carlisle FoodService Products (“CFS”)

On February 1, 2018, the Company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell its CFS operations to The Jordan Company for $750 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory clearances, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
The CFS segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing and selling of commercial foodservice and janitorial products with three main focus markets. CFS is a leading provider of (i) tabletop dining supplies, table coverings and display serving ware, (ii) food preparation, storage and handling and transport supplies and tools and (iii) cleaning and sanitation tools and waste handling for restaurants, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, business and industry work sites and education and government facilities. CFS’s Dinex® brand business is a leading provider of healthcare meal delivery systems for in‑room and mobile dining for acute care hospital patients and senior assisted living residents. CFS’s Sanitary Maintenance Products group is a leading provider of Sparta® brand cleaning brushes, floor care supplies and waste handling for janitorial professionals managing cleaning and maintenance for commercial, industrial and institutional facilities. The CFS segment also includes the San Jamar product lines, acquired on January 9, 2017, which are leading brands of universal dispensing systems and food safety products for foodservice and hygiene applications. With the acquisition, CFS designs and distributes dispensers for paper towels, tissue, soap and air purification as well as personal and food safety products for commercial and institutional foodservice and sanitary maintenance customers, under the San Jamar brand.

CFS operates manufacturing facilities in the United States and Mexico. Sales are primarily in North America. CFS’s product lines are distributed from four primary distribution centers located in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Illinois and Wisconsin to wholesalers, distributors and dealers. These distributor and dealer customers, in turn, sell to restaurants, hotels and on-site foodservice operators and sanitary maintenance professionals. Distributors and dealer business relationships are managed through both direct sales personnel and subcontracted manufacturer representatives. 
Raw materials used by the CFS segment include polymer resins, stainless steel and aluminum. Key raw materials are sourced nationally from recognized suppliers of these materials.
The working capital practices for this segment include:


• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.


The CFS segment serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2017 three distributor customers together represented approximately 21% of this segment’s net sales, none of which represented 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of one of these distributor customers could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and operating income. Backlog orders are not considered a significant factor of CFS’s business and were $7.7 million and $5.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. All orders are reasonably expected to be filled in 2018.

The CFS segment is engaged in markets that are generally highly competitive and competes equally on price, service and product performance.
Carlisle Fluid Technologies (“CFT”)

The CFT segment is a market leader in designing, manufacturing and selling highly‑engineered liquid and powder finishing equipment and system components primarily in the automotive, automotive refinishing, aerospace, agriculture, construction, marine and rail industries. The segment operates manufacturing and assembly facilities primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, China and Japan, with approximately 60% of its sales outside the United States. The CFT segment manufactures and sells products that are sold under the brand names of Binks®, DeVilbiss®, Ransburg®, BGK® and MS Powder®. The majority of sales into CFT's industries are made through a worldwide network of distributors, integrators and some direct to end‑user sales. These business relationships are managed primarily through direct sales personnel worldwide.

Key raw materials for this segment include carbon and various grades of stainless steel, brass, aluminum, copper, machined metals, carbide, machined plastic parts and PTFE. Key raw materials are typically sourced worldwide and have at least two vendor sources to better assure adequate supply.

Approximately 20% to 25% of CFT’s annual net sales are for the development and in some cases assembly of large fluid handling or other application systems projects. Timing of these system sales can result in sales that are higher in certain quarters versus other quarters within the same calendar year. In addition, timing of system sales may cause significant year over year sales variances.

The working capital practices for this segment include:


• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.


CFT serves a large and diverse customer base. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the segment’s net sales and operating income. Backlog orders are not considered a significant factor of CFT’s business and were $31.9 million and $33.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. All orders are reasonably expected to be filled in 2018.
The CFT segment competes against both regional and international manufacturers. Major competitive factors include innovative designs, the ability to provide customers with lower cost of ownership, dependable performance and high quality at a competitive price. CFT’s product's ability to spray, mix or deliver a wide range of coatings, applied uniformly in exact increments, is critical to the overall appearance and functionality. The segment’s installed base of global customers is supported by a worldwide distribution network with the ability to deliver critical spare parts and other services. Brands that are well recognized and respected internationally, combined with a diverse base of customers, applications and industries served, positions the CFT segment to continue designing patented, innovative equipment and solutions for customers across the globe.

Raw materials are sourced worldwide to better assure adequate supply. Critical raw materials generally have at least two vendor sources.

The working capital practices for this segment include:

• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 days to 60 days.


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 days to 90 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand.


CBF serves a large and diverse customer base; however, in 2017 one customer represented approximately 20% of this segment’s net sales, but did not represent 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on this segment’s net sales and operating income. Backlog orders were $190.3 million and $119.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively; however, not all of these orders are firm in nature. All orders are reasonably expected to be filled in 2018.

This segment strives to be a market leader by competing globally against regional and international manufacturers. Few competitors participate in all served markets. A majority of competitors participate in only a few of CBF’s served markets on a regional or global basis. Markets served are competitive and the major competitive factors include product performance, quality, product availability and price. The relative importance of these competitive factors varies by market segment and channel.
