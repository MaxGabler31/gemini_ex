Operations
 
The Company operates through its wholly owned subsidiary VBF Brands. VBF Brands operated as a Nonprofit Mutual Benefit entity until December 21, 2017 when it was converted to a For Profit entity. Prior to December 21, 2017, VBF Brands operated as a collective under the Compassionate Use Act. Since VBF Brands was operating as a Nonprofit until December 21, 2017, the Company determined that it cannot book any revenue from the activities associated while it operated as collective under the Compassionate Use Act and as a non-profit. However, the Company will book the revenue generated by VBF Brands since December 21, 2017. The Company previously was operating through its subsidiary Battle Mountain Genetics; however, upon the conversion of VBF Brands to a for profit entity the Company has been operating all of its cannabis actives through VBF Brands. 
 
The Company grows its own cannabis plants through its Cannabis Cultivation License. The material grown and harvested from its cultivation operations are either packaged and sold through the Company’s Distribution license or processed through its Manufacturing license which is later sold through its Distribution license. This allows the Company to sell its own manufactured or other products with a reduced cost to produce since it grew its own raw materials.

Expansion
 
The Company has been in the process of retro fitting our current greenhouse and expanding our operations. The Company has completely overhauled and retrofitted the greenhouse operations. The retro fit has taken over 15 months to date and is continuing. The company has completed the following items as part of the retrofit:

1. | Completed rewiring the greenhouse to provide the additional power needs for the retrofit. Additionally, rewiring will be completed once the utility has increased the amount of power to the property (which it is currently doing)

2. | Installed 54 LED lights in our grow bays. See below as the company will install additional lights in future. 
3. | Installed atmospheric sensors in the greenhouse. The sensors provide wireless thermometer / hygrometer readings with alerts. The sensors allow the company to monitor the Sensor Push sensors remotely and with the cloud service we can receive current conditions, alerts and the full data history of each grow bay.
4. | Built out new dry rooms. 
5. | Built out new trim rooms. 
6. | Built out new manufacturing room capable of making C02 oil and distillates.

2. | Purchase new commercial fans to increase air flow throughout the greenhouse 
3. | Purchase to dual end lights for the greenhouse to allow better lighting in winter months and to allow tiers to be built 
4. | Expand current greenhouse foot print from 12,000 to between 22.000 and 40,000. The Company has acquired the rights to approbatively 12,000 square feet of bare land on the current property to expand its current house. 2,000 square feet are currently used for other operations. The Company hopes to build a 2 story facility that would allow greenhouse space on the top floor and allow for distribution, nursery, manufacturing and indoor cultivation on the 1st floor.

Research and Development
 
Since the adoption of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) the commercial landscape of the cannabis businesses in California has changed. The Company has been researching which strains produce the best in the unique climate of Monterrey Valley and in a greenhouse. The Company’s greenhouse operations are located in an area between the mountains where fog creates high levels of humidity and moisture, particularly at night. Cannabis has rarely been grown in greenhouse in Monterrey county prior to the passing of MAUCRSA. As a result, the Company has been testing various strains that would be high produces but also reduce mold from the high humidity and moisture. The Company’s goal is two grow only two strains of cannabis. The Company has identified which strains it intends to grow and has established its own stain (Cookies In The Sky) as well. 
 
Additionally, the Company has been reviewing what products generate the highest returns. The price of flower in California is low and the Company doesn’t know if the price of flower will ever reach the prices seen before MAUCRSA. As such, the Company (based on its testing and research) has decided that it will process its harvests into oil/distillates and Pre-rolls. The Company is constantly reevaluating the market and its prices and will adjust as necessary.
