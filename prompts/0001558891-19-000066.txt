SigmaRenoPro was incorporated on June 16, 2017. Our fiscal year end is June 30, and we have no subsidiaries. Our business offices are currently located at Aloni Noa’kh St. 1, Kiryat Motzkin 26402, Israel. Omar Aamar, has served as our President, Treasurer and a director since June 16, 2017.

Mr. Aamar, however, has no knowledge of and no experience in this business in the United States. The Company is focusing its operations in the United States because the Company’s believes the barriers to operation of its business in the United States is not burdensome and the United States has a large home repair market.

We also intend to have a Ratings & Reviews section, as well as testimonials from past clients, stating whether or not they were satisfied with the services rendered by member contractors.
 
Ratings& Reviews
 
One of the most important services we intend to offer our members is the “word of mouth” feedback from homeowners. For each project description placed at SigmaRenoPro, the homeowner be asked to submit a Ratings & Reviews survey for the service provider you selected to complete the job. We believe that providing this information will help other homeowners make their service provider selection, and that information provided by Ratings & Reviews will contribute to the online community we intend to build. We also believe that the content of our Ratings & Reviews section wil help us keep track of the quality of service provided by our member contractor, thereby providing valuable information that benefits other homeowners.
Our Web Site
 
We intend to create a website as the primary means through which we intend to conduct out business. The website will have a “My Account” feature, which will be a personal web space at SigmaRenoPro, provided free of charge to users A secure section where you keep your profile information. From an account, a user will be able to:
 
•                     Add your address, phone number, or e-mail address to your personal profile
 
•                     Update your profile information at any time
 
•                     Post and manage job details
 
•                     Communicate with member contractors
 
Canceling a contract
 
If a homeowner or service professional decides to end or alter a project, the terms of such termination or change to an existing project will be have to be agreed upon between the user and the service professional hired by the user. In the case of such termination, the Company believes that a user should expect to pay for work completed and materials purchased up to the point. To help avoid misunderstandings that could result in a project’s termination, the Company believes that specific project information should be detailed in a formal contract. This would include, but not be limited to the project description, materials to be used, start and finish dates between the project owner and service professional.

Screening Process for Service Professionals
 
To keep our services free to homeowners, our screening process is minimal. We will ask contractors to provide accurate experience and licensing information. We will also ask that they keep information on their profile page updated. We will ask homeowners to validate member service professionals’ licensing, insurance, and references themselves, and believe that by doing so, we help enable homeowners to make better hiring decisions increase the chance of project success. Additionally, homeowners will have the personal assurance of verifying the accuracy of such information about the member service provider.
 
The difference between a licensed service professional and a non-licensed service professional
 
Licensing means that the service professional has been authorized by the province or local government to work within his or her trade or profession. Licensing requirements vary province-to-province; not all trades or job sizes require a license.
 
Pricing 
 
Our services are designed to be free to homeowners. Service professionals will be required to pay an advertising fee to participate in SigmaRenoPro’s network. Each service provider will be required to complete a profile, specifying the type of work they perform, their areas of expertise and experience, and the geographical areas they serve. We will provide lead generation services; new customer leads that match the service professional’s criteria. We will charge service professional pays a monthly subscription fee of $49.00 to access the leads which originate from our service.
 
Treatment of personal information
 
By inputting information into secure online forms, only the intended party is allowed to translate the encoded information. We plan to selected to secure personal information on our serves by using SSL (secure socket layer) technology and secure server software. SSL is an industry standard for protecting web communications. The SSL security protocol provides some data encryption, server authentication and message integrity.
 
A secure server is the software used to navigate the Internet and has been created to encrypt, or scramble, all information until the authorized recipient can unscramble it. Information is scrambled by a mathematical formula using 128-bit encryption. When viewing any Web page, a lock icon near the lower-right corner of the window indicates whether the entire contents of the page is protected by encryption while it is being received by your computer. When a closed lock icon appears, then the page is protected by encryption. When a broken lock icon appears, then the page is not protected by encryption.
 
Competition and competitive strategy
 
We expect that we will compete for members with traditional, offline consumer resources, and with online providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, breadth, depth and timeliness of information and strength and recognition of our brand. We believe that we will face extensive challenges in attempting to compete because we do not have the ability to verify who is purchasing services that compete with ours, at what cost, and the terms and conditions under which our competitors are offering our services. We believe that the market for our services is constantly changing in terms of how business who offer our services are able to sell such services to home owners.
 
Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchise restrictions and contractual obligations & concessions
 
We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks. We do not own patents.

Compliance with government regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that government regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business, however, any government regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.
 
Research and development activities and costs
 
We have not incurred any research and development costs to date.

Omar Aamar, our sole officer and director, is our only employee, and he currently works full time on Company matters.
