Corporate History
 
We began operating as an independent company on July 1, 2015 (the “Separation Date”) after separating from EID (the “Separation”). The Separation was completed pursuant to a separation agreement and other agreements with EID, including an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, a transition services agreement, and an intellectual property cross-license agreement. These agreements govern the relationship between us and EID following the Separation and provided for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights, and obligations at the Separation Date. On August 31, 2017, EID completed a merger with The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”). Following their merger, EID and Dow engaged in a series of reorganization steps and, in 2019, separated into three publicly-traded companies named Dow Inc., DuPont, and Corteva. EID is now a subsidiary of Corteva, and, at this time, any agreements related to our Separation are between us and EID, Corteva, and DuPont.

Titanium Technologies Segment 
 
Segment Overview
 
Our Titanium Technologies segment is a leading, global manufacturer of high-quality TiO2 pigment. TiO2 pigment is used to deliver whiteness, brightness, opacity, and ultra-violet light protection in applications such as architectural and industrial coatings, flexible and rigid plastic packaging, polyvinylchloride (“PVC”), laminate papers used for furniture and building materials, coated paper, and coated paperboard used for packaging. We sell our TiO2 pigment under the Ti-Pure™ brand name. We also sell a chloride-based TiO2 pigment under the BaiMaxTM brand name, which is exclusively produced for customers in Greater China. We operate four TiO2 pigment production facilities: two in the U.S., one in Mexico, and one in Taiwan. In total, we have a TiO2 pigment nameplate capacity of approximately 1.25 million metric tons per year. In addition, we have a large-scale repackaging and distribution facility in Belgium. We also operate mineral sands mining and/or separation operations in Starke, Florida, Nahunta, Georgia, Jesup, Georgia and Offerman, Georgia. 
 
We are one of a limited number of manufacturers operating a chloride process to produce TiO2 pigment. We believe that our proprietary chloride technology enables us to operate plants at a much higher capacity than other chloride technology-based TiO2 pigment producers, as we uniquely utilize a broad spectrum of titanium-bearing ore feedstocks to achieve one of the highest TiO2 pigment unit margins in our industry. This technology, which is in use at all of our production facilities, provides us with one of the industry’s lowest manufacturing cost positions. Our R&D efforts focus on improving production processes and developing TiO2 pigment grades that help our customers achieve optimal cost and product performance to enhance total end-user value.
 
We sell over 20 different grades of TiO2 pigment, with each grade tailored for targeted applications. Our portfolio of premium performance TiO2 pigment grades provides end-users with benefits beyond opacity, such as longer-lasting performance, brighter colors, and the brilliant whites achievable only through chloride-manufactured pigment.

The Chemours Company
 
We have operated a titanium mine in Starke, Florida since 1949. Additionally, in 2019, we acquired a titanium mine in Nahunta, Georgia, from which we source ore feedstock to be processed at its associated mineral sands separation facility in Offerman, Georgia. The titanium mine and mineral sands separation facility in Georgia were acquired in the third quarter of 2019 as part of our acquisition of Southern Ionics Minerals, LLC (“SIM”). This acquisition expanded our flexibility and scalability to internally source ore and enabled the commencement of mining operations at our surface mine in Jesup, Georgia in August 2020. Our mines provide us with low-cost, high-quality domestic ilmenite ore feedstock and currently supply less than 10% of our ore feedstock needs, with expansion options that could further increase our in-sourced raw material base. Co-products of our mining operations, which comprised less than 5% of our total net sales in Titanium Technologies during 2021, include zircon (zirconium silicate) and staurolite minerals. We are a major supplier of high-quality calcined zircon in North America, primarily focused on the precision investment casting industry, foundry, specialty applications, and ceramics. Our staurolite blasting abrasives are used in a variety of surface preparation applications, including steel preparation and maintenance and paint removal.
Industry Overview and Competitors
 
The overall demand for TiO2 pigment is highly correlated to growth in the global residential housing, commercial construction, and packaging markets. In the long-run, industry demand for TiO2 pigment is generally expected to grow proportionately with global GDP growth. We continue to experience customers’ preference for high-quality Ti-PureTM offerings. After above-GDP trend TiO2 demand growth in 2016 and 2017, the TiO2 pigment market contracted below the GDP trend in 2018 and 2019. In 2020, the TiO2 pigment market expanded, while global GDP contracted during the novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic. In 2021, the TiO2 pigment market again grew at greater-than-global GDP growth rates. In the longer-term, we expect global TiO2 pigment demand to resume its historical correlation with global GDP growth rates.
 
We estimate that the worldwide demand for TiO2 pigment in 2021 was approximately 7.3 million metric tons, a second consecutive year above-GDP growth; of which approximately 60% was for premium performance pigments. Worldwide nameplate capacity in 2021 was estimated to be approximately 8.6 million metric tons. The products manufactured on this global capacity base are not fully substitutable due to pigment quality consistency and pigment product design. We believe that the utilization of the premium performance manufacturing base is considerably higher than that for general purpose, lower-performance production. As future customer demand grows, we have the ability to incrementally increase our production capacity by approximately 10% through technology-enabled de-bottlenecking processes. We believe that unlocking this additional 10% of capacity is in line with our stated intention to grow with our customers’ needs over the long-term. This new capacity is expected to provide the equivalent of a new production line, while requiring a fraction of the capital investment. Our increased pigment production capacity will be supported by investments to extend our ilmenite mines and through long-term ore feedstock contracts with our suppliers.
 
Competition in the TiO2 pigment market is based primarily on product performance (both product design and quality consistency), supply capability, technical service, and price. Our major competitors within higher-performance pigments include Tronox Holdings plc, LB Group Co.Ltd., Venator Materials plc, Kronos Worldwide, Inc., and INEOS AG. 
 
Raw Materials
 
The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of TiO2 pigment are titanium-bearing ores, chlorine, calcined petroleum coke, and energy. We source titanium-bearing ores from a number of suppliers around the globe, who are primarily located in Australia and Africa. To ensure proper supply volume and to minimize pricing volatility, we generally enter into contracts in which volume is requirement-based and pricing is determined by a range of mechanisms structured to help us achieve competitive cost. We typically enter into a combination of long-term and medium-term supply contracts and source our raw materials from multiple suppliers across different regions and from multiple sites per supplier. Furthermore, we typically purchase multiple grades of ore from each supplier to limit our exposure to any single supplier for any single grade of ore in any given time period. Historically, we have not experienced any problems renewing such contracts for raw materials or securing our supply of titanium-bearing ores.
 
We play an active role in ore source development around the globe, especially for those ores which can only be used by us, given the capability of our unique process technology. Supply chain flexibility allows for ore purchase and use optimization to manage short-term demand fluctuations and provide a long-term competitive advantage. Our process technology and ability to use lower-grade ilmenite ore gives us the flexibility to alter our ore mix to low-cost configuration based on sales, demand, and projected ore pricing. Lastly, we have taken steps to optimize routes for distribution and increase storage capacity at our production facilities.
 
Transporting chlorine, one of our primary raw materials, can be costly. To reduce our need to transport chlorine, we have a chlor-alkali production facility run by a third party that is co-located at our New Johnsonville, Tennessee site. Calcined petroleum coke is an important raw material input to our process. We source calcined petroleum coke from well-established suppliers in North America and China, typically under contracts that run multiple years to facilitate materials and logistics planning through the supply chain. Raw materials distribution efficiency is enhanced through the use of bulk ocean, barge, and rail transportation modes. Energy is another key input cost in the TiO2 pigment manufacturing process, representing approximately 10% of the production cost. We have access to natural gas-based energy at our U.S. and Mexico TiO2 pigment production facilities and our Florida and Georgia minerals plants, supporting advantaged energy costs given the low cost of shale gas in the U.S.

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
 
We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force. In 2018, we launched our TVS strategy, which we believe to be foundational to maintaining and growing our Titanium Technologies business. Our TVS strategy establishes a commercial framework that allows us to focus on enhancing durable, value-oriented customer relationships, while providing customers access to a predictable and reliable supply of high-quality TiO2. Customers can purchase Ti-PureTM TiO2 either through long-term contracts or through Ti-PureTM Flex. Launched in 2019, Ti-PureTM Flex is a new, innovative channel that provides customers the unique ability to purchase Ti-Pure™ TiO2 via our web-based portal, the first of its kind in the industry. To further expand our reach beyond these sales channels, we also utilize third-party sales agents and distributors. 
 
TiO2 pigment represents a significant raw material cost for our direct customers, and as a result, purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management teams. TiO2 pigment, however, is only a small fraction of the cost when considering certain end-use applications, especially in segments with larger value chain players, such as specialty coatings, plastics, and laminates applications. Our sales organization works to develop and maintain close relationships with key decision makers in our value chain. In addition to close purchasing relationships, our sales and technical service teams work together to develop relationships with all layers of our customers’ organizations to ensure that we meet our customers’ commercial and technical requirements. When appropriate, we collaborate closely with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying product characteristics or developing new product grades.
 
To ensure efficient distribution, we have a large fleet of railcars, which are predominantly used for outbound distribution of products in the U.S. and Canada. A dedicated logistics team, along with external partners, continually optimizes the assignment of our transportation equipment for each product line and geographic region to maximize utilization and maintain an efficient supply chain.
 
Customers
 
Globally, we serve approximately 600 customers through our Titanium Technologies segment. In 2021, our 10 largest Titanium Technologies customers accounted for approximately 36% of the segment’s net sales, and one Titanium Technologies customer represented more than 10% of the segment’s net sales. Our larger customers are typically served through direct sales and tend to have medium-term to long-term contracts. We serve our small-size and mid-size customers through a combination of our direct sales and distribution network. Our direct customers in the Titanium Technologies segment are producers of decorative coatings, automotive and industrial coatings, polyolefin masterbatches, PVC, engineering polymers, laminate paper, coatings paper, and coated paperboard. We focus on developing long-term partnerships with key market participants in each of these sectors. We also deliver a high level of technical service to satisfy our customers’ specific needs, which helps us maintain strong customer relationships.
Seasonality
 
The demand for TiO2 pigment is subject to seasonality due to the influence of weather conditions and holiday seasons on some of our applications, such as decorative coatings. As a result, our TiO2 pigment sales volume is typically lowest in the first quarter, highest in the second and third quarters, and moderate in the fourth quarter. This pattern applies to the entire TiO2 pigment market, but may vary by region, country, or application. The impacts of seasonality on demand for TiO2 pigment may also be altered by economic factors, such as changes in global GDP, and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property, including trade secrets, certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, and other proprietary rights, is a critical part of maintaining our technology leadership and competitive edge. Our business strategy is to file patent and trademark applications globally for proprietary new product and application development technologies, and we work actively on a global basis to create, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights. 
 
Our Titanium Technologies segment relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge, continuing technological innovation, and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position in this sector. Within this segment, we hold significant intellectual property in the form of trade secrets, and, while we believe that no single trade secret is material in relation to our combined business as a whole, we believe that our trade secrets are material in the aggregate. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology, and our business could be harmed if our trade secrets are not maintained in confidence. Within our Titanium Technologies segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our trademarks Ti-Pure™ and BaiMaxTM to be valuable assets. We have registered the Ti-PureTM trademark in a number of countries and the BaiMaxTM trademark in China.
 
Our Thermal & Specialized Solutions segment is a technology leader in the markets in which it participates. We maintain a large fluorochemicals patent portfolio, inclusive of patents which will expire in varying years into the 2030s. We consider our Opteon™ and Freon™ trademarks used in the Thermal & Specialized Solutions segment to be valuable assets.
 
Our Advanced Performance Materials segment possesses extensive know-how and trade secrets related to manufacturing technologies for a broad range of specialized fluoropolymers, as well as application development technology for fluoropolymers based on comprehensive knowledge of customer applications. We hold patents relating to manufacturing for certain products with high quality, specifications and purity as required by the electronics, communications, automotive, wire and cable, and other industries. Additionally, our Advanced Performance Materials segment is a leader in and holds patents relating to non-fluorinated materials for use as durable water repellants for garments and other uses. In our Advanced Performance Materials segment’s intellectual property portfolio, we consider our TeflonTM, VitonTM, NafionTM, and KrytoxTM trademarks to be valuable assets.
 
Our Chemical Solutions segment is a manufacturing technology leader in a majority of the markets in which it participates. Trade secrets are one of the key elements of our intellectual property security in the Chemical Solutions segment, as most of the segment’s manufacturing and applications development technologies are no longer under patent coverage. 
 
The protections afforded under our patents and trademarks vary based on country, scope of individual patent, and trademark coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country. Our patents, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance to our business. However, although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any single patent (or group of related patents) or trademark. We believe that securing our intellectual property is critical to maintaining our technology leadership and our competitive position, especially with respect to new technologies or the extensions of existing technologies. Our proprietary process technology can be a source of incremental income through licensing arrangements.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Information related to environmental matters is included in several areas of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including: (i) Item 1A – Risk Factors; (ii) Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, under the heading “Environmental Proceedings”; (iii) Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and, (iv) “Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 22 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Central to our CRC are our ten goals that we aim to achieve by 2030. These goals fall into three pillars: Inspired People, Shared Planet, and Evolved Portfolio. In April 2021, we announced an update to our climate goals to better align our climate commitment with the Paris Accord and set us on a path to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 2050. The Shared Planet pillar of our CRC underlines our commitment to deliver essential solutions responsibly, without causing harm to the Earth. With a focus on the responsible treatment of climate, water, and waste, our shared planet 2030 goals are comprised of the following:
  
• | Reduce absolute operations Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 60%;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce air and water process emissions of fluorinated organic chemicals by 99% or more; and,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce our landfill volume intensity by 70%.
--+---------------------------------------------

 
As part of the Evolved Portfolio pillar of our CRC, we are reimagining our portfolio to offer solutions that are also safer, healthier, and more resilient for a world that demands more. We believe that climate change is an important global issue that presents both opportunities and challenges for our company, our partners, and our communities. Climate change matters for our company are likely to be driven by changes in physical climate parameters, regulations and/or public policy, and changes in technology and product demand. Our operations and business results are increasingly subject to evolving climate-related legislation and regulations, inclusive of restrictions on GHG emissions, cap and trade emissions trading systems, and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel, and energy, among other provisions. Such regulatory matters have led, and are expected to continue to lead, to subsequent developments in product technology and demand. This helps guide our investment decisions and drive growth in demand for low-carbon and energy-efficient products, manufacturing technologies, and services that facilitate adaptation to a changing climate. Our business segments conduct market trend impact assessments, continuously evaluate opportunities for existing and new products and are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from increased consumer demand for and/or legislation mandating or incentivizing the use of products and technologies necessary to achieve a low-carbon economy.
 
For example, global regulations driving the phase-down of HFCs, including the EU’s F-Gas Directive, the EU’s Mobile Air Conditioning Directive, and the recently enacted U.S. American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (“AIM”), promote the adoption and sale of our high performing Opteon™ products, which have lower GWP and zero ozone-depletion footprint. Our Opteon™ portfolio has been developed to meet global regulations while maintaining or improving performance compared to the products they replace in refrigeration and cooling applications, such as food transportation, food and pharmaceutical/medical storage, food manufacturing and retail, automotive air conditioning, and residential and commercial building air conditioning. By the year 2025, we estimate that our low GWP products will eliminate an estimated 325 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents on a global basis.
 
We are a proponent of the recently passed bipartisan AIM Act, going into effect in 2022, that will begin the national phase-down of hydrofluorocarbons. Earlier this year, we announced the implementation of an improvement project to significantly reduce emissions of HFC-23 at our Louisville, Kentucky manufacturing site. The project includes the design, custom-build and installation of proprietary technology to capture at least 99% of HFC-23 process emissions from the site. 
 
Our growth prospects in fluoropolymers are also enhanced by regulation driving the increasing demand for electric vehicles and high-performance, low-emission vehicles. Our fluoropolymers are critical to delivering high performance over a wide range of harsh operating conditions, enhancing passenger safety, improving emission controls, and better fuel economy, and enable vehicle electrification and the shift to hydrogen-powered vehicles. We expect the use of our fluoropolymers in vehicles to increase, driven by the automotive industry’s trends toward energy efficiency and clean energy due to evolving emissions performance regulations and increasing adoption of electric vehicles. 
 
As an energy and emissions intensive company, our costs of complying with complex environmental laws, regulations, and enforcements, as well as internal and external voluntary programs, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. These laws, regulations, and enforcements may change and could become more stringent over time, which could result in significant additional compliance costs, increased costs of purchased energy or other raw materials, increased transportation costs, investments in, or restrictions on, our operations, installation or modification of GHG-emitting equipment, or additional costs associated with GHG emissions. Additionally, significant regional or national differences in approaches to the imposition of such regulations and restrictions could present competitive challenges in a global marketplace. Currently, most of our global operating facilities are required to monitor and report their GHG emissions but may or may not be subject to programs requiring trading or emission controls. The EU Emission Trading System and the cap and trade pilot program in Mexico apply to our operating sites in those regions. Furthermore, U.S. political administration could lead to additional federal regulation with respect to GHG emissions limits and/or other legislation that could impact our operations. By tracking and taking action to reduce our GHG emissions footprint through energy efficiency programs and focused GHG management efforts, we can decrease the potential future impact of these regulatory matters.

Management believes that its relations with contract workers are good.
 
Corporate Responsibility Commitment
 
In 2018, we issued our inaugural CRC Report, which expresses our commitment to our stakeholders to make chemistry as responsible as it is essential. This commitment is embedded within our growth strategy as a company. Our inaugural report included 10 ambitious goals targeted for completion by 2030, built on the pillars of Inspired People, Shared Planet, and an Evolved Portfolio. These goals are designed to promote accountability to our commitment and position us for long-term success. Our Inspired People pillar underlines our commitment to creating and sustaining a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace. With a focus on creating a vibrant workplace culture that attracts, retains, and empowers the best and brightest in their fields, the following table sets forth our Inspired People goals and our relative progress at December 31, 2021.

The Chemours Company
 
In support of our goals and commitment to foster a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees can contribute, thrive and grow, we have several Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”): Chemours Asian Group, Chemours Black Employee Network, Chemours Latin American Resource Organization, Chemours Pride Network, Chemours Women’s Network, Early Career Network, and VetNet. The objectives of these ERGs are to help foster a diverse, inclusive workplace by educating and building awareness across the Company on challenges underrepresented groups often face, how to be more inclusive, supporting career development efforts, and leading community outreach efforts. We also facilitate additional educational programs, workshops and discussions on a variety of diversity and inclusion topics for global, regional, and local employee groups. In 2020, we introduced a new compensations metric focused on increasing the total proportion of women in the global workforce. The annual bonus structure for all Chemours executives and senior leaders now includes this metric, which we believe is important to drive interim progress toward our 2030 gender diversity goal.
 
Ultimately, we believe that our efforts towards achieving each of these goals result in a company culture that views our individual differences, safety-focused mentality, and talent development initiatives as sources of competitive strength.
 
Safety Obsession
 
Responsible chemistry begins with our focus on the safety and health of people all along our value chain, including our own workforce. Our Safety Obsession is deeply rooted in our responsible chemistry ethos and is one of our five core values, emphasizing our steadfast belief that a safe workplace is a profitable workplace. Our safety commitment extends beyond ourselves and our manufacturing sites, and we make ongoing, upfront investments in our people, our facilities, and our processes to protect the safety and well-being of our workforce, our business partners, and the communities in which we operate. 
 
Our Safety Obsession culture requires and encourages our global workforce to seek out training opportunities to increase safety literacy and capability at our sites. We offer computer-based learning, classroom-style learning, hands-on training and demonstration for proficiency, and mentoring and apprenticeship training for skill development. Our course content ranges from general safety awareness trainings to specialized trainings, covering topics such as hazardous materials, electrical safety, and so forth. Our training programs are tailored to individual employee roles, promoting the safety of our workforce while simultaneously providing the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain operational performance at our complex manufacturing facilities. In measuring the safety performance of our workforce, we monitor several metrics, including those set forth in our Inspired People goals above.
 
Beyond the physical safety aspects of our workplace, we also consider the emotional and psychological aspects of employee safety – an idea we refer to as holistic safety. Emotional and psychological safety exists when team members feel accepted and respected, allowing them to bring their authentic selves to work without fear of negative consequences to self-image, workplace status, or career opportunities. Holistic safety and business performance are interconnected, as an environment lacking emotional and psychological safety creates distraction, which may lead to workplace missteps and can result in physical accidents. At Chemours, the way in which we work is grounded in our Safety Obsession, which encompasses the physical, emotional, and psychological dimensions of safety. Holistic safety also acknowledges our aspiration to be a diverse, equitable, and inclusive company, where every employee is fully engaged and actively contributing to business results.
 
Consistent with our Safety Obsession, we have taken several actions during 2021 to promote the health, safety, and well-being of our workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions have included requiring remote working arrangements where practicable, the imposition of travel restrictions, limiting non-essential visits to plant sites, performing health checks before every shift, providing personal protective equipment for our “essential” operations employees at our sites and labs, and enhanced industrial hygiene and sanitization practices. We have also provided our employees with opportunities to participate in webinar sessions focused on challenges that may be experienced during trying times, such as mental and financial health. We will continue to make decisions that promote the health and safety of our employees and contractors throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Professional Development
 
We encourage our employees to own their careers by taking the lead in their respective professional development journeys. We actively support our employees in their professional development, providing multiple learning opportunities and trainings. We also provide our employees with the necessary tools and resources to develop and produce the next generation of innovative chemistry products, most notably, our 312,000-square-foot R&D facility on the Science, Technology, and Advanced Research campus of the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware (“Chemours Discovery Hub”). Given our focus on experiential learning, we leverage special projects, short-term assignments, and cross-functional job rotations to further develop talent and support employees in meeting their professional aspirations. Semi-annual performance reviews, combined with annual career development planning and ongoing feedback, provide support in performance and development and help our people know where they excel and how they can improve.

Equitable Employee Compensation
 
We provide a total compensation package that is targeted to be competitive with the markets in which we compete for talent, while allowing individual employee pay to vary equitably based on performance, skills, and experience. Our compensation programs are globally aligned, and, where possible, our total rewards plans include base salary, incentives (short- and long-term), financial, physical, and mental well-being programs, and monetary and social recognition. We routinely review our total rewards practices in the markets in which we compete to ensure our plans allow us to recruit and retain the diverse talent we need to be successful. We are firmly committed to paying our employees in a fair and equitable manner, regardless of race or gender, and we have implemented global total rewards tools to promote equitable remuneration. To ensure we deliver on this commitment, we periodically engage with independent third-party consultants to review our compensation practices and recommend pay actions.
Employee Attraction and Retention
 
We believe that our workplace culture, as reinforced by our CRC, corporate values, professional development opportunities, and competitive employee compensation, is critical in attaining a high offer acceptance rate and maintaining low levels of attrition, thereby enabling us to attract talented employees and retain and recognize the benefits of our investments in our employees’ technical manufacturing capabilities, safety acumen, and professional development. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our voluntary attrition percentage was approximately 9%.
