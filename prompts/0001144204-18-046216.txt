Medical and Healthcare
 
Chamberlain University (“Chamberlain”), formerly Deaconess College of Nursing, was founded in 1889 and acquired by Adtalem in 2005. In May 2017, Chamberlain College of Nursing broadened its reach in healthcare education through the establishment of Chamberlain University, and now offers its programs through its College of Nursing and College of Health Professions. Nursing degree offerings include a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (“BSN”) degree (including both the onsite three-year BSN and the online Registered Nurse (“RN”) to BSN Degree Completion Option (“RN-to-BSN”)), an online Master of Science in Nursing (“MSN”) degree, including Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”), and the Doctor of Nursing Practice (“DNP”) degree, which is also offered online.
 
In fiscal year 2017, Chamberlain received approval to launch an online Master of Public Health (“MPH”) degree program through its College of Health Professions. MPH classes started in July 2017.
 
Eleven of Chamberlain’s 21 campuses are co-located with DeVry University and other Adtalem operations. The most recently established Chamberlain campus is located on the Ochsner Medical Center campus in New Orleans. Chamberlain had 28,037 students enrolled in the July 2018 term, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year.
 
Chamberlain provides an education experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, innovation and integrity. Chamberlain is committed to graduating health professionals who are empowered to transform healthcare worldwide.
 
Chamberlain College of Nursing’s degree programs span the professional nursing spectrum, from the baccalaureate entry into nursing practice to the terminal practice doctorate. The baccalaureate program integrates theoretical knowledge of general education and nursing content, psychomotor skills development, and development of clinical judgment/reasoning to help students develop the education and skills necessary for a lifetime of personal and professional growth. Pre-licensure students apply theoretical knowledge through robust, hands-on instruction using sophisticated simulators and simulation scenarios along with clinical training at hospitals or other healthcare facilities. Post-licensure students develop advanced nursing practice knowledge and skills through classroom, simulation, project development and practicum experiences in a variety of healthcare settings. Chamberlain has developed numerous partnerships with hospitals and other healthcare facilities to insure that educational objectives can be met for its programs.
 
Chamberlain’s pre-licensure BSN degree is an onsite baccalaureate program. The BSN program enables students to complete their BSN degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to the typical four-year BSN program with summer breaks. During calendar year 2017, Chamberlain pre-licensure BSN students who completed the National Council Licensure Examination (“NCLEX”) had an overall pass rate of 84%.
 
Students who already have achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN completion option in three semesters of full-time study, although most students enroll part-time while they continue working as nurses.
 
The online MSN degree program offers four non-direct-care specialty tracks: Educator, Executive, Informatics and Healthcare Policy. These programs require 36 credit hours and are designed to be completed in approximately two years of part-time study. Chamberlain also offers a direct-care FNP track. This program requires 45 credit hours along with 650 lab and clinical hours and is designed to be completed in two and a half years of part-time study.
 
The online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”). The DNP program is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing and offers an alternative to research-focused Ph.D. programs. The Chamberlain DNP program offers a Healthcare Systems Leadership track. The program requires 32 to 40 credit hours along with 512 to 1,024 clinical practicum hours. The program can be completed in five to six semesters of study.

Chamberlain’s College of Health Professions MPH degree program focuses on preparing students to become public health practitioners to work with communities and populations globally to promote healthy communities, and to prevent community health problems such as disease, poverty, health access disparities and violence through interdisciplinary coursework.
 
Medical and Veterinary Schools includes three institutions:
 
· | American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (“AUC”) confers the Doctor of Medicine (“M.D.”) degree;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ross University School of Medicine (“RUSM”) confers the M.D. degree; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (“RUSVM”) confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (“D.V.M.”) degree. Through its Postgraduate Studies Program, RUSVM also offers Master of Science (“MSc”) and Doctoral (“Ph.D.”) degrees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Together, the three schools along with the Medical Education Readiness Program (“MERP”) and the Veterinary Preparation Program had 5,556 students enrolled in the May 2018 semester, a 1.2% increase compared to the same term last year.
 
AUC was founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in August 2011. AUC is located in St. Maarten and has graduated over 6,900 physicians since inception. The mission of AUC is to provide an excellent medical education to qualified students of diverse backgrounds. This is accomplished in an atmosphere of academic integrity and scholarship, which fosters the highest standards in professional ethics and competence.
RUSM, which was founded in 1978, and acquired by Adtalem in May 2003, provides medical education. As of June 30, 2018, RUSM is operating in Tennessee at facilities owned by Lincoln Memorial University (“LMU”) and an additional facility on the island of St. Kitts. RUSM’s original campus, located in the country of Dominica, was severely damaged by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, and RUSM was unable to continue operations on the island. RUSM’s Internal Medicine Foundation program resides in Miramar, Florida. RUSM has graduated more than 13,000 physicians. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective, successful physicians. RUSM seeks to accomplish this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician.
 
On August 3, 2018, Adtalem announced plans to relocate RUSM to Barbados from its temporary location in Knoxville, Tennessee at facilities owned by LMU and a facility on St. Kitts. Academic facilities will be located in Bridgetown. Student housing will be located close to academic facilities in the parish of Christ Church at an existing housing community and will include amenities, student services and convenient transportation to campus. It is expected that students will begin the January 2019 semester in Barbados, pending final regulatory approval from the U.S. Department of Education (“ED”).
 
AUC’s and RUSM’s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools as evidenced by student performance on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (“USMLE”) tests and residency placement. AUC’s and RUSM’s programs consist of three academic semesters per year, which begin in January, May and September, allowing students to complete their basic science instruction in less time than they would in a U.S. medical school. The programs provide a generalist medical education and the foundation for post graduate specialty training, which is primarily completed in residencies in the U.S.
 
Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences in modern classrooms and laboratories, with AUC’s campus located in St. Maarten and RUSM’s campus located at LMU (until December 2018 and then in Barbados starting in January 2019, pending final regulatory approval from ED). After medical school students sit for Step 1 of the USMLE, which assesses whether students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine, they complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations under AUC and RUSM direction, and conducted at approximately 50 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers affiliated with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.
 
MERP assists prospective AUC and RUSM students in building the academic foundation they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians.

MARKET TRENDS AND COMPETITION
 
Medical and Healthcare
 
Chamberlain
 
Chamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 1,800 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and diploma schools of nursing. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education. Nursing constitutes the largest occupation in healthcare in the U.S., with 2.8 million RNs in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment of RNs is expected to grow 15% from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average employment growth rate for all occupations.
 
In the pre-licensure nursing market, enrollment caps and limited new student enrollment periods are common among traditional four-year education institutions and community colleges. Despite the long-term need for nurses, institutions are not increasing educational capacity to keep up with demand. According to AACN, U.S. nursing schools turned away 56,397 qualified applicants from baccalaureate nursing programs in 2017 due to budget constraints and an insufficient number of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space and clinical preceptors. In addition, demand for BSN degrees is impacted by the Institute of Medicine’s recommendation and the American Nurses Credentialing Center Magnet designation criteria that require hospitals to employ or have a plan to employ at least 80% BSN nurses.
 
In post-licensure nursing education, there are over 600 institutions offering RN-to-BSN programs and over 500 institutions offering master’s degrees in nursing. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option has received two Quality Matters Certifications for Online Learning Support and Online Teaching Support. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option is offered in 50 states. The MSN degree program is offered in 50 states and its FNP Specialty Track is offered in 44 states. As of July, 2018, Chamberlain offers its DNP and MPH programs in 48 states.
 
Medical and Veterinary Schools
 
AUC and RUSM compete with approximately 145 accredited U.S. schools of medicine, 33 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine and 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from ED Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with AVMA accredited schools, of which 30 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 14 are other international veterinary schools.
 
The medical and veterinary schools educational institutions attract potential students for several reasons. Some applied to U.S.-based medical or veterinary schools but were not admitted or were wait-listed. Some students elected not to apply to U.S. schools because of self-perceived chances of gaining acceptance. For some students, the medical and veterinary schools education institutions are their first or only choice of schools because of their commitment to and focus on quality and on practitioner-oriented teaching.
 
For the 2017-2018 academic year, the Association of American Medical Colleges (“AAMC”) reported 51,680 U.S. medical school applicants, a 2.6% decrease from the prior year. Of these applicants, 21,338 enrolled, a 1.5% increase over the prior year.
 
For the 2017-2018 academic year, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (“AACOMAS”) reported 20,836 applicants to U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, a 0.6% increase over the prior year. The number of Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation approved seats of 7,317 increased 11% over the prior year.

For the 2017-2018 academic year, the Association of American Veterinary Medicine Colleges (“AAVMC”) received 7,507 applicants, a 6.1% increase over the prior year, for the approximately 4,200 seats available at AAVMC institutional members (U.S. and international). The number of available seats increased approximately 2% over the prior year.
 
According to the AAMC Center for Workforce Studies, in a March 2018 analysis, projected physician demand will continue to grow faster than supply, leading to a projected total physician shortfall of between 42,600 and 131,300 physicians by 2030. The shortfall ranges from 39,500 to 90,700 physicians in 2025, and it is projected to increase significantly by 2030.
 
There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical and veterinary education.
 
Professional Education
 
ACAMS
 
Money laundering and the financing of terrorism are financial crimes with significant economic effects. The United Nations Office on Drug and Crime estimates that in one year 2-5% of global GDP, or $1.6 to $4 trillion, is laundered globally. Money laundering can occur in various forms including corruption, drug trafficking, tax evasion and cybercrime. AML is the set of procedures, laws and regulations designed to combat the practice of generating income through illegal actions. Professionals who need effective AML procedures include financial institutions, insurers, asset managers, lawyers, broker-dealers, private equity firms, consultants, law enforcement and credit institutions. This training protects companies against various costs such as financial penalties from regulatory bodies, personal liability, financial action from shareholders or employees and reputational damage.
 
There are approximately 1.6 million AML industry individuals in the various market segments, with individuals outside of the U.S. representing approximately 1.1million, or 70 percent of the addressable market. Organizations training methods are met by third-party training, internally developed training or informal training. Regulators are pressuring companies to develop higher standards and to maintain these standards. Due to frequent regulatory changes, internal training is being supplemented with third-party developed training programs to meet higher regulatory standards. ACAMS is the largest AML certifier and is recognized as an industry leader in AML credentialing.
 
According to a survey completed by Dow Jones in 2015, the top three memberships with which professionals associate are ACAMS, American Bankers Association and Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. Over 38,000 professionals have received the CAMS designation, which is completed by passing the ACAMS CAMS certification examination as a qualified applicant. Two of the top read industry publications are ACAMS Today and ACAMS moneylaundering.com. ACAMS is also a leader in the industry in conference attendance. Conferences and seminars are held in 23 countries annually serving approximately 10,000 attendees.
 
Becker
 
In 2016, the AICPA reported that there were approximately 80,000 accounting graduates combined across bachelor’s and master’s degree candidates and in 2017, approximately 39,000 new candidates began the CPA exam. The number of accounting graduates and first-time CPA exam test takers has increased modestly (1-2% annually) on average over the last 10 years; the number of test-takers may fluctuate in specific years based on the timing of student demand and exam changes. Employment of accounting graduates at U.S. public accounting firms, a key driver of CPA demand, has been relatively flat over the same timeframe, although specific years have varied in line with overall U.S. economic cycles and recession periods.
 
Becker competes with other purveyors of exam preparation, including courses offered by colleges, universities and other public and private training companies. Consumer preference in exam preparation modality has increasingly evolved from live delivery to online and self-study, which has driven Becker to increase focus on stand-alone product quality, pricing, accessibility and service to students and partners.
 
Becker management believes that in addition to its 60-plus year history and track record of successful student achievement on the CPA exam, it has advantages over competitors that include:

Technology and Business
 
Adtalem Brazil
 
The Brazilian private postsecondary education market grew by 47% between 2005 and 2015 (onsite students), reaching approximately $17 billion in revenue and enrollment of 6.1 million students in 2015, according to Hoper Educational Consulting and the Ministry of Education (“MEC”). In addition, the goals defined by the Nacional Plan of Education (“NPE”) for the period from 2011 to 2023, indicate a continuing favorable scenario for the expansion of higher education in Brazil. NPE expects to increase enrollments by 50%, which would represent almost five million more higher education students in the next seven to eight years.
 
Brazil has the largest private higher education market in Latin America, which until recently was highly fragmented. Within the last several years, private equity firms and international educational groups have been investing in the country’s education institutions resulting in consolidation of the market. Private higher education institutions can be divided into three different segments:
 

· | Mass market: fastest growing segment, with the highest regulatory risk;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Superior quality market: growth is driven by gaining market share from competitors; increasing the accessibility of student financing should accelerate growth in this market; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Niche market: highly specialized, has limited growth potential.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Most Adtalem Brazil institutions compete in the superior quality market. Adtalem Brazil faces local competition at each location in which it operates. Nationwide there are also competitors such as: Laureate, Kroton Educacional, Anima, SER and UNIP.
 
According to the Brazilian Association of Distance Learning Education, the number of jobs requiring successful completion of a competency exam grew by 45% from 2013 to 2015. There are currently approximately 12 million applicants for these positions. The number of Order of Attorneys of Brazil Exam (the equivalent of the state bar exams in the U.S.) applicants has been steady at approximately 115,000 for the past two years.

ACCREDITATION
 
Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance and institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating a candidate’s credentials; and parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance, and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.
Medical and Healthcare
 
Chamberlain
 
Chamberlain is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”).The BSN, MSN and DNP programs at Chamberlain are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. Chamberlain’s MPH program has begun the accreditation process with the Council on Education for Public Health, which accepted Chamberlain’s application in October 2017.
Medical and Veterinary Schools
 
The Government of St. Maarten authorizes AUC to confer the M.D. degree. AUC is accredited by the Accreditation Commission on Colleges of Medicine (“ACCM”). The ACCM is an international medical school accrediting organization for countries that do not have a national medical school accreditation body. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation of ED (“NCFMEA”) has affirmed that the ACCM has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the U.S. Liaison Committee on Medical Education (“LCME”). In addition, AUC is approved to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of states, including California, Florida and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and approve an international medical school’s programs. AUC students can join residency training programs in all 50 states.
 
RUSM’s primary accreditor will become the Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (“CAAM-HP”) upon the start of the January 2019 semester, pending final regulatory approval from ED. CAAM-HP is authorized to accredit medical programs by the government of Barbados. On July 26, 2018, Barbados authorized RUSM to confer the M.D. degree. RUSM will continue to be recognized and accredited by the Dominica Medical Board (“DMB”), which is authorized to accredit medical programs by the government of Dominica until the end of the September 2018 semester (in December 2018). The Commonwealth of Dominica currently authorizes RUSM to confer the M.D. degree. The NCFMEA has affirmed that the country of Dominica and CAAM-HP for Barbados, have established and enforce standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the LCME. In addition, RUSM is approved to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of states, including California, Florida, New Jersey and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and accredit an international medical school’s programs. RUSM students can join residency training programs in all 50 states.
 
RUSVM has been recognized and accredited by the government of the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis (“St. Kitts”) and is chartered to confer the D.V.M. degree. RUSVM confers a D.V.M. degree that is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (“AVMA COE”). RUSVM has affiliations with more than 20 AVMA-accredited U.S. and international colleges of veterinary medicine so that RUSVM students can complete their final three semesters of study in the U.S. or abroad. RUSVM has received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board. The Postgraduate Studies program offers Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM's themed Research Centers.

Becker’s accreditation from the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education & Training (“ACCET”) allows it to extend its accredited programs to international students that desire to attend a live course in the U.S., and issue the required Form I-20 “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status” to international students accepted into the program.
Technology and Business
 
Adtalem Brazil
 
The Brazilian MEC controls and regulates postsecondary education at all levels in Brazil. The MEC also controls the issuance of licenses and permits.
 
The MEC licensing process occurs on two levels: institutional and programmatic. Each institution is required to obtain a license, which must be renewed every three to five years. An Indice Geral de Cursos (“IGC”) or “General Programs Index” score above 2, within a range of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the maximum grade possible) is considered satisfactory. The current ICG score of all Adtalem Brazil institutions, excluding Joao Pessoa and Sao Luis, is 3 or greater. Joao Pessoa and Sao Luis have not yet received a score.
 
The IGC score is calculated using the average of all the “Conceito Preliminar de Curso” or “Preliminary Program Grade” (“CPC”) of the institution, weighted by the number of students. The CPC is an academic quality metric composed of:
 

55% | Results of the ENADE - the national end-of-program exam organized by MEC;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


30% | Faculty credentials and part or full-time faculty status; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------


15% | Student satisfaction.
----+----------------------

 
MEC also licenses programs at each institution. The regulations are different for undergraduate and graduate programs. For undergraduate programs, MEC must grant “authorization” status before classes may commence. After a program is 50% to 75% complete, MEC auditors visit the program to grant the definitive license, which can be automatically renewed every three years, unless the program presents an unsatisfactory CPC below 3 within a range of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the maximum grade). Currently, Adtalem Brazil has approximately 490 authorized undergraduate programs; 223 of which have received the definitive license. 
 
Programs leading to Master of Science and Doctorate degrees are strictly regulated at the graduate level in Brazil by MEC. Other types of graduate programs are loosely regulated and do not have licenses issued by MEC. Adtalem Brazil has one Master of Science program at UniFBV and two at Grupo Ibmec. All three of these programs had their licenses renewed in 2017.
 
FINANCIAL AID AND FINANCING STUDENT EDUCATION
 
Students attending Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Adtalem Brazil, DeVry University and Carrington pay for their education through a variety of sources. These sources include government-sponsored financial aid, private and university-provided scholarships, employer-provided tuition assistance, veteran’s benefits, private loans and cash payments. Students attending Becker review courses and ACAMS programs are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but may receive partial or full tuition or fee reimbursement from their employers. In addition, Becker’s CPA Exam Review Course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.

The following table summarizes Adtalem’s cash receipts from tuition and related fee payments by fund source as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Final data for fiscal year 2018 is not yet available.
 

 | Fiscal Year | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------+----
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Funding Source: | | | | | | 
Federal Assistance (Title IV) Program Funding (Grants and Loans) | | 53 | % | | 58 | %
Brazil FIES Public Loan Program | | 4 | % | | 4 | %
State Grants | | 0 | % | | 1 | %
Private Loans | | 1 | % | | 1 | %
Student accounts, cash payments, private scholarships, employer and military provided tuition assistance and other | | 42 | % | | 36 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
The table above includes DeVry University and Carrington revenue. The increase in the “Student accounts, cash payments, private scholarships, employer and military provided tuition assistance and other” funding source is the result of management’s efforts to reduce Adtalem’s funding provided by U.S. federal and Brazilian FIES sources.
 
All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the “HEA”) guides the federal government’s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008 and was signed into law in August 2008. Committee leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives has put forth a comprehensive HEA reauthorization proposal; however, the Senate has not put forth a comprehensive HEA proposal, and reauthorization activities have not begun in earnest. When HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Among the issues that management believes may be addressed in a final reauthorization bill are college access and affordability, funding for student financial assistance programs, additional reporting requirements and transparent information for consumers, and accreditation and oversight.
 
Information about Particular U.S. Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below.
U.S. Federal Financial Aid Programs
 
Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA.
 
1. Grants. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs.
 

· | Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2017-2018 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from $975 to $8,880.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant, and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed $4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25% matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below) or by externally provided scholarship grants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Loans. Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students may participate in the Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington undergraduate students may also be eligible for Subsidized Loans within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program.

· | Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). First time borrowers after July 1, 2013 are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans only for 150% of the published length of their academic program. Loan limits per academic year range from $3,500 for students in their first academic year to $5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--


· | Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Awarded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Unsubsidized Loan limits per academic year range from $2,000 for students in their first and second academic year to $7,000 in later undergraduate years and increasing to $20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional amount of Unsubsidized Loans up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Subsidized and/or Unsubsidized Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is $57,500 and $138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Direct Parent PLUS and Direct Grad PLUS Loans: Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student’s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. Interest begins to accrue, and repayment obligations begin, immediately after the loan is fully disbursed, but may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance, which includes allowances for tuition, fees and living expenses. Both Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Federal Work-study. This program offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds.
State Financial Aid Programs
 
Certain states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, offer state grant or loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending Adtalem institutions.
Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Students attending Chamberlain or DeVry University online while in the U.S., or attending AUC, RUSM or RUSVM may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions and interest relief on loans.
Information about Other Financial Aid Programs
 
Private Loan Programs
 
Some Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student’s educational and living costs and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student’s enrollment and financial aid awards.
 
Most private loans are approved using the student’s or a co-borrower’s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more expensive than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the traditional financial aid process. Student finance personnel at Adtalem’s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students generally receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans.
 

16

Adtalem does not maintain a preferred lender list, but does list all of the lenders that made private loans to Adtalem students in the previous year and still offer loans to Adtalem students.
 
Tax-favored Programs
 
The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored “529” college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning credits and tax deductions for interest on student loans.
Brazilian Government Financial Aid Programs
 
Adtalem Brazil students are eligible for loans under Brazil’s FIES public loan program (“Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil” or “Students Financing Fund”), which is financed by the Brazilian government. Adtalem Brazil also participates in PROUNI (“Programa Universidade para Todos” or “University for All Program”), a Brazilian governmental program, which provides federal tax incentives to educational institutions in exchange for providing scholarships to lower income undergraduate students.
 
FIES targets students from low socio-economic backgrounds enrolled at private postsecondary institutions. Eligible students receive loans with below market interest rates. For contracts signed prior to calendar year 2018, the students are required to begin repaying after an 18-month grace period upon graduation. For contracts signed beginning in calendar year 2018, there is no grace period and the students start repaying small installments during the first month after borrowing. FIES pays participating educational institutions tax credits, which can be used to pay certain federal taxes and social contributions. FIES repurchases excess credits for cash. For contracts signed before 2017, FIES deducts from periodic payments to Adtalem Brazil an average amount of 5.81% to cover administrative expenses (5.63%) and student defaults (0.18%). For contracts signed beginning in calendar year 2018, FIES deducts from periodic payments to Adtalem Brazil an average amount of 15% to cover administrative expenses (2%) and student defaults (13%). There is no additional cost to Adtalem Brazil if students fail to pay their loans under the applicable rules. In fiscal year 2018, approximately 21% of Adtalem Brazil’s degree-seeking students were financing their education under the FIES program, and approximately 20% of Adtalem Brazil revenue was associated with the program.
 
PROUNI promotes the offering of tuition discounts in private postsecondary education schools by granting federal tax incentives for the participating institutions. Discounts reduce tuition by either 50% or 100%. The percentage is driven by rules defined by the Brazilian government based on family monthly earnings. Neither Adtalem Brazil nor its students receive direct funding from the federal government for the tuition discounts granted. Instead, Adtalem Brazil reduces its income tax expense and its income tax liability for the amount of the discounts issued. As of June 30, 2018, approximately 23% of Adtalem Brazil’s undergraduate students have obtained scholarships under the PROUNI program.
 
The FIES and PROUNI programs are required to be managed in accordance with government standards. Any regulatory violation can be the basis for disciplinary action, including suspension, limitation or termination of rights under the financial assistance program.
 
In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of FIES and PROUNI must maintain satisfactory academic progress towards completion of their programs of study and an appropriate grade point average every semester.
 
The Brazilian government has stated that it is supportive of the FIES program, which is important in helping achieve the national goal of increasing the number of college graduates; however, changes enacted in recent years to the FIES regulations added restrictions limiting student eligibility for FIES funding and extending the government’s time to disburse funding to participating institutions. These changes include reducing the number of new FIES contracts and adding minimum required entrance test scores in order to qualify for a FIES loan. In addition, the annual interest rate borrowers are charged increased from 3.4% to 6.5%.
 
Adtalem-Provided Financial Assistance
 
Chamberlain students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships with awards up to $2,500 per semester.
 
Students at AUC may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $5,000 to $47,500 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSM may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $3,000 up to a full semester of tuition to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSVM may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $600 to $24,000 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees.

DeVry University undergraduate students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships, grants and tuition savings opportunities. Scholarship and grant programs generally are designed to help make the degree more affordable for students. Besides various scholarship offerings, DeVry University also provides tuition discounts for employer partners’ employees as well as military students and their spouses, which range from 10% to 60%.
 
Carrington students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships. Scholarship programs generally are designed to attract recent high school graduates, friends and family of current students and alumni, and to assist students’ access to key high demand fields, with awards up to $1,500 for certificate programs.
 
Adtalem’s institutional loan programs are available to students at its Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington institutions. These loan programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, books and fees and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM and RUSVM loans may be used for students’ living expenses. Repayment plans for institutional loan program balances are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges accrue each month on the unpaid balance. Students begin repaying loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay and reduce the possibility of over borrowing and to minimize interest being accrued on the loan balance. Payments may increase upon completing or departing the program. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan.
 
The institutional loans do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest, and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the loans and counseled to utilize all federal funding options. FICO credit scores of 620 and above are required for eligibility for institutional loans for DeVry University students.
 
Adtalem institutional loans are carried on our balance sheet, net of related reserves, and there are no relationships with external parties that shift the risk away from Adtalem.
 
Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance
 
Chamberlain and DeVry University students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session. Educational expenses paid by an employer on behalf of an employee generally are excludable from the employee’s income if provided under a qualified educational assistance plan. At present, the maximum annual exclusion is $5,250.
Becker
 
Students taking the Becker review courses are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition reimbursement from their employers. Private loans are also available to students to help meet the program costs. In addition, Becker’s CPA Exam Review Course can be financed through Becker under an 18-month term loan program.
LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
 
Government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. and Brazil. Like other educational institutions, Adtalem’s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation or termination proceeding.
U.S. Federal Regulations
 
Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs, and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following:

18
--


· | The federal government through ED;
--+-----------------------------------


· | The accrediting agencies recognized by ED; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | State higher education regulatory bodies.
--+------------------------------------------

 
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.
 
In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been focus in recent years by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV-eligible institutions is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the first institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Adtalem’s other institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem’s other institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see “A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 
We have summarized the most significant regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. Adtalem and DeVry University have been impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and are currently facing multiple related lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on Adtalem, see in this Form 10-K: (1) “Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, (2) the subsection of “Item 1A – Risk Factors” entitled “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry,” and (3) the subsection of “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Eligibility and Certification Procedures
 
The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Schools that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are required to submit a letter of credit equal to at least 10% of their prior fiscal year Title IV disbursements and submit to ED’s heightened cash monitoring process. Provisional certification status also carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution.
Defense to Repayment Regulations
 
Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan (“Direct Loan”) made under the Federal Direct Loan Program (“Direct Loan Program”). ED’s current defense to repayment regulations (“Defense to Repayment Regulations”) permit a borrower to assert a borrower defense to repayment of a Direct Loan if the institution’s acts or omissions give rise to a cause of action against the institution under state law. On October 28, 2016, ED published final regulations (the “2016 DtR Regulations”) expanding defenses and addressing other related matters, including certain circumstances under which ED may impose a fine, or limit, suspend, or terminate an institution’s participation in Title IV programs. The 2016 DtR Regulations create a new federal standard for borrower defenses to repayment of Direct Loans, new limitation periods for such claims, and new processes for resolution of such claims. On June 14, 2017, ED announced that, due to pending litigation, it is indefinitely postponing implementing the majority of 2016 DtR Regulations, which were due to take effect on July 1, 2017. On June 16, 2017, ED announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to renegotiate the Defense to Repayment regulations. A committee was formed and held three negotiating sessions between November and February 2018. ED submitted proposed regulations to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review, and on July 25, 2018, ED published proposed new Defense to Repayment regulations. ED’s proposal includes a higher threshold for establishing misrepresentation, provides for a statute of limitation for claims submission, narrows the current triggers allowed for letter of credit requirements and eliminates provisions for group discharges. ED has provided a comment period of 30 days, and is expected to publish final rules in the late fall of 2018; if implemented, the proposed rules would become effective with claims on loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2019. Management is unable to predict what any revised regulations may contain, the result of any other current or future rulemakings, or the impact of such rulemakings on our business.

Gainful Employment
 
ED regulations known as “gainful employment” regulations (“GE”), which became effective July 1, 2015, define which private-sector programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized profession and are therefore eligible for Title IV funding. ED announced a negotiated rulemaking process on June 16, 2017 to substantially revise the GE regulations and held rulemaking sessions beginning December 2017 through March 2018. Draft regulations rescinding the GE regulations have been published by ED; ED has allowed for a 30-day comment period and intends to publish final, revised GE rules in the late fall of 2018.
 
Current GE regulations have three components:
 
Certification: Institutions must certify that each of their GE programs meet applicable state licensure and accreditation requirements and satisfy applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure and certification.
 
Accountability Measures: To maintain Title IV eligibility, GE programs must meet minimum standards for limiting the debt burden versus the earnings of their graduates. GE programs will be considered passing, in the zone, or failing for each year in which the accountability measures are calculated, described as follows:
 
Pass: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden of 8% or less of total earnings or 20% or less of discretionary income.
 
Zone: Programs that are not passing and whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12% of total earnings or greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30% of discretionary income.
 
Fail: Programs whose graduates have an assumed annual loan repayment burden greater than 12% of total earnings and greater than 30% of discretionary income.
 
Programs that fail in two out of any three consecutive years or do not pass in any four consecutive years will be disqualified from participation in the Title IV programs for a period of three years, and an institution is prohibited from establishing Title IV eligibility for any substantially similar program during that period.
 
Transparency: Institutions are required to make annual public disclosures regarding the performance and outcomes of their GE programs. The disclosures include information regarding program costs, median debt of all graduates and completion and placement rates and may include additional disclosure items in future periods.
 
The accountability measures typically weigh a calculated debt burden from graduates who completed their studies three and four years prior to the measuring academic year against the mean or median earnings of these graduates during the most recent calendar year prior to the conclusion of the measuring academic year. Thus, for the 2014-2015 academic year (the first measurement year under these regulations), the cohort includes graduates from the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years and earnings for these graduates from calendar year 2014. ED obtained its graduate earnings data from the Social Security Administration. Debt burdens for students enrolled in programs that require an internship or residency prior to licensure, such as the medical doctor degrees offered by AUC and RUSM, are calculated from cohorts who completed their studies six and seven years prior to the measuring academic year.

“90/10 Rule”
 
An ED regulation known as the “90/10 Rule” affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs (excluding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Final data for fiscal year 2018 is not yet available.

 | Fiscal Year | 
--------------------------------------------------------+-------------+---
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Chamberlain University | | 63 | % | | 64 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 80 | % | | 79 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 82 | % | | 82 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | | 83 | % | | 83 | %
DeVry University | | 62 | % | | 63 | %
Carrington College: | | | | | | 
California | | 75 | % | | 78 | %
Boise | | 66 | % | | 69 | %
Portland | | 81 | % | | 77 | %
Phoenix | | 80 | % | | 80 | %

 
In September 2016, Adtalem committed to voluntarily limit to 85% the amount of revenue that each of its six Title IV-eligible institutions derive from federal funding, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. As disclosed in the third party review report that has been made publicly available, Adtalem’s institutions met this lower threshold for fiscal year 2017. Final data for fiscal year 2018 is not yet available. Adtalem is committed to implementing measures to promote responsible recruitment and enrollment, successful student outcomes, and informed student choice. Management believes students deserve greater transparency to make informed choices about their education. This commitment builds upon a solid foundation and brings Adtalem to a new self-imposed level of public accountability and transparency.
 
Incentive Compensation
 
An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement have not established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. New rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increased the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes have limited and are expected to continue to limit Adtalem’s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that Adtalem has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment, admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds.

Standards of Financial Responsibility
 
A financial responsibility test is required for continued participation by an institution’s students in U.S. federal financial assistance programs. For Adtalem’s participating institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. The test is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution’s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution’s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution’s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED’s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible, but require additional oversight. These schools are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, a school with a score of less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the school be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).
 
For the past several years, Adtalem’s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. If Adtalem becomes unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards or otherwise demonstrate, within the regulations, its ability to continue to provide educational services, then Adtalem could be subject to heightened cash monitoring or be required to post a letter of credit to enable its students to continue to participate in federal financial assistance programs.
 
Administrative Capability
 
The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny its eligibility for Title IV programs.
State Authorization
 
Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington are specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington have obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where their students are enrolled.
 
On December 19, 2016, ED published new rules concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. The regulations, which would have become effective beginning July 1, 2018, but which have been delayed until July 1, 2020, require an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state from which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The regulations also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. With regard to additional locations or branch campuses located in foreign countries, the regulations require that such campuses be authorized by an appropriate government agency of the country where the additional location or branch campus is located and, if at least half of an educational program can be completed at the location or branch campus, be approved by the institution's accrediting agency and be reported to the state where the institution's main campus is located. Lastly, the regulations require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education or correspondence courses. ED has announced its intention to renegotiate these rules, but we cannot predict the timing and effective date of any future final regulations.
 
Cohort Default Rates
 
ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges — many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled than do four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities.

22
--

 

Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the “cohort” defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20% for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution’s operations and its students’ ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30% for three consecutive years also are ineligible for Pell Grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40% or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs.
 
According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid increased to 11.5% in fiscal year 2014 (the latest period for which data are available) from 11.3% in fiscal year 2013.
 
Default rates for Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington students follow. The latest period for which final three-year data is available is fiscal year 2014.
 

 | Cohort Default Rate | 
--------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+-----
 | 2014 | | | 2013
Chamberlain University | | 3.4 | % | | 3.6 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 1.2 | % | | 0.5 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 0.7 | % | | 0.7 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | | 0.2 | % | | 0.7 | %
Carrington College: | | | | | | 
California | | 15.2 | % | | 13.6 | %
Boise | | 11.1 | % | | 13.1 | %
Portland | | 17.2 | % | | 11.1 | %
Phoenix | | 19.0 | % | | 17.9 | %
DeVry University | | 12.5 | % | | 10.6 | %

 
The three-year cohort default rates for Carrington College-California, Carrington College-Portland and Carrington College-Phoenix were in excess of 15% for the most recent year (fiscal year 2014). In accordance with ED regulations, disbursement of Title IV Stafford Loans for new students is delayed for a thirty day period for any institution with a cohort default rate in excess of 15%. Management believes that the delay in the related cash receipts for this Adtalem institution will not materially affect its operations or cash flow.
 
Satisfactory Academic Progress
 
In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.
 
Change of Ownership or Control
 
Any material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by our institutions’ accreditors and/or reauthorization by state licensing agencies. If we experience a material change of ownership or change of control, then Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, DeVry University and Carrington may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained on a timely basis. After a material change in ownership or change of control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years.
 
In addition, most institutions would be required to report any material change in stock ownership to their principal institutional accrediting body, including in the case of Chamberlain and DeVry University, the HLC, and would be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, the applicable accreditor may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of the affected institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review.
 

23
--

 

In addition, some states in which our institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of material changes in ownership or changes of control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by such a change in ownership or control.
 
Refer to “If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of our company, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditation and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 
Brazil Regulations
 
Governmental regulations in foreign countries significantly affect our international operations. New or revised interpretations of regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. Changes in existing or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate, permissible activities, and costs of doing business outside of the U.S. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our international operations.
State Approvals and Licensing
 
Adtalem institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities or Canadian ministries to recruit students, operate schools, conduct exam preparation courses and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain, DeVry University and Carrington location is approved to grant certificates, diplomas, associate, bachelor’s, master’s and/or doctorate degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. Adtalem believes it is in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required.
 
Many states and Canadian provinces require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted approximately $18.0 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Becker, DeVry University and Carrington.
 
Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. Adtalem believes it is in material compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If Adtalem were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, Adtalem could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, Adtalem has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Adtalem’s quarterly revenue and net income fluctuate primarily as a result of the pattern of student enrollments. Generally, the schools’ highest enrollment and revenue typically occur in the fall, which corresponds to the second and third quarters of Adtalem’s fiscal year. Enrollment is slightly lower in the spring except in Brazil, and the lowest enrollment generally occurs during the summer months. Adtalem’s operating costs do not fluctuate as significantly on a quarterly basis.
 
Results of operations reflect both this seasonal enrollment pattern and the pattern of student recruiting activity costs that precede the start of every term. Revenue, operating income and net income by quarter for each of the past two fiscal years are included in “Note 17: Quarterly Financial Data” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
