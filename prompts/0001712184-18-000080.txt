Item 1. | BUSINESS

(a) General Development of Business
Liberty Latin America Ltd. is an international provider of video, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Through our subsidiaries, we provide residential and business-to-business (B2B) services in (i) 18 countries, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean through Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (C&W), (ii) Chile through VTR.com SpA (VTR) and (iii) Puerto Rico through Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC (Liberty Puerto Rico), an entity in which we hold a 60.0% ownership interest (Searchlight Capital Partners L.P. (Searchlight) owns the 40% of Liberty Puerto Rico that we do not own). C&W also provides (i) B2B services in certain other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and (ii) wholesale communication services over its sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks that connect over 40 markets in that region. In the following text, the terms “Liberty Latin America,” “we,” “our,” “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Latin America Ltd. or collectively to Liberty Latin America Ltd. and its subsidiaries. 
The operations of C&W are provided through various consolidated subsidiaries, including the following subsidiaries where we own less than 100%: Cable & Wireless Panama, SA (C&W Panama) (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns most of our operations in Panama); The Bahamas Telecommunications Company Limited (BTC) (a 49.0%-owned entity that owns all of our operations in the Bahamas); and Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited (C&W Jamaica) (an 82.0%-owned entity that owns the majority of our operations in Jamaica). On December 28, 2017, one of our subsidiaries made a public take-over offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares in C&W Jamaica not already owned through our subsidiaries at a price of $1.45 per share (in Jamaican dollars). The offer closes February 28, 2018 unless otherwise extended.
We were originally formed as a Bermuda company on July 11, 2017, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Global plc (Liberty Global) under the name LatAm Splitco Ltd. and we changed our name to Liberty Latin America Ltd. on September 22, 2017. During October 2017, the Board of Directors of Liberty Global authorized a plan to distribute to the holders of Liberty Global’s LiLAC Shares (as defined and described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) common shares in our company (the Split-Off), which was completed on December 29, 2017.
References in the following text to our assets, liabilities or businesses reflect the historical information of (i) certain former subsidiaries of Liberty Global for periods prior to the Split-Off and (ii) Liberty Latin America and its consolidated subsidiaries for the period following the Split-Off. Although Liberty Latin America was previously reported on a combined basis, the financial and operating information presented herein includes Liberty Latin America and its consolidated subsidiaries for all periods presented, unless stated otherwise.
Split-off of Liberty Latin America from Liberty Global
Following the Split-Off, Liberty Latin America and Liberty Global operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any share ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In the Split-Off, 48,428,841 Class A common shares, 1,940,193 Class B common shares and 120,843,539 Class C common shares of Liberty Latin America were issued. Several agreements were entered into in connection with the Split-Off between Liberty Latin America, Liberty Global and/or certain of their respective subsidiaries. The following summarizes the material agreements:

• | a reorganization agreement, which provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Split-Off, certain conditions to the Split-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Liberty Global and Liberty Latin America with respect to and resulting from the Split-Off;


• | a tax sharing agreement (the Tax Sharing Agreement), which governs the parties’ respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters;


• | a services agreement (the Services Agreement), pursuant to which, for up to two years following the Split-Off with the option to renew for a one-year period, Liberty Global will provide Liberty Latin America with specified services, including access to Liberty Global’s procurement team and tools to leverage scale and take advantage of joint purchasing opportunities, certain management services, other services to support Liberty Latin America’s legal, tax, accounting and finance departments, and certain technical and information technology services (including software development services associated with the Horizon platform, management information systems, computer, data storage, and network and telecommunications services);

I-1


• | a sublease agreement (the Sublease Agreement), pursuant to which Liberty Latin America will sublease office space from Liberty Global in Denver, Colorado until May 31, 2031, subject to customary termination and notice provisions; and


• | a facilities sharing agreement, pursuant to which, for as long as the Sublease Agreement remains in effect, Liberty Latin America will pay a fee for the usage of certain facilities at the office space in Denver, Colorado.

Developments in the Business
We have expanded our footprint through new build projects and strategic acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network. We are also upgrading networks to make them two-way compatible. During the past three years, we connected or upgraded approximately 900,000 additional homes and commercial premises, including homes and commercial premises connected by C&W prior to its acquisition by Liberty Global on May 16, 2016, to our two way networks. We have made strategic acquisitions to drive scale benefits across our business, enhancing our ability to innovate and deliver quality services, content and products to our customers. Within the last five years, we completed the following acquisitions:

• | the acquisition on May 16, 2016 of C&W, a well-recognized and respected brand that has been in use for more than 70 years; and


• | the acquisition on June 3, 2015 of Choice Cable TV, a cable and broadband services provider in Puerto Rico, which has been integrated into our Liberty Puerto Rico operations.

For information regarding our material financing transactions, see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted a number of our markets in the Caribbean, resulting in varying degrees of damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure in these markets. The most extensive damage occurred in Puerto Rico and certain of C&W’s markets (collectively, the Impacted Markets), including damage to power supply and transmission systems. For information regarding the impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Impacts of Hurricanes included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Pending Acquisition
On February 12, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 80% of Costa Rican cable operator, Cabletica, which is part of Televisora de Costa Rica S.A. in an all cash transaction. Cabletica is a leading cable operator in Costa Rica that provides analog and digital television, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony services to residential customers. The current owners of Cabletica will retain the remaining 20% interest. The transaction is subject to customary closing adjustments and conditions, including regulatory approvals, and is expected to close during the second half of 2018. For additional information on this acquisition, see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business
Overview
We are a leading telecommunications company with operations in Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America. The communications and entertainment services that we deliver to our residential and business customers include video, broadband internet, telephony and mobile services. In most of our operating footprint, we offer a “triple-play” of bundled services of digital video, internet and telephony in one subscription. We are also focused on leveraging our full-service product suite to deliver fixed-mobile convergence offerings. Available fixed service offerings depend on the bandwidth capacity of a particular system and whether it has been upgraded for two-way communications.
Our business products and services also include enterprise-grade connectivity, data center, hosting and managed solutions, as well as IT solutions with customers ranging from small and medium enterprises to international companies and governmental agencies. We also operate an extensive sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable network that connects over 40 markets in the region, providing connectivity solutions both within and outside our operating footprint.
We are the largest fixed-line provider of high-speed broadband and video services across a number of our markets, including Chile, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. We also operate the largest telephony network in most of our C&W markets where we provide residential communications services. In addition, we offer mobile services throughout most of our operating footprint. Across C&W’s markets, we are a mobile network operator in Panama and most of our Caribbean markets, including the Bahamas and Jamaica. As a network provider, we are able to offer a full range of voice and data services, including value-added, data-based and fixed-mobile converged services. In Chile, VTR provides mobile services as an MVNO and leases a third-party’s radio access network.

(a) | During September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused significant damage to our operations in Puerto Rico, as well as certain geographies within C&W, including the British Virgin Islands, Dominica and Anguilla, and to a lesser extent, Turks & Caicos, the Bahamas, Antigua and other smaller markets, resulting in disruptions to our telecommunications services within these islands. With the exception of the Bahamas, all of these C&W markets are included in the “Other” category in the accompanying table. For Puerto Rico, British Virgin Islands, Dominica and Anguilla, where we are still in the process of assessing the impacts of the hurricanes on our networks and subscriber counts, (i) the subscriber levels reflect the pre-hurricane RGU (as defined below) counts as of August 31, 2017, adjusted for net known disconnects through December 31, 2017 and (ii) the homes passed levels reflect the pre-hurricane homes passed counts as of August 31, 2017, adjusted for an estimated 30,000 homes in Puerto Rico that were destroyed in geographic areas we currently do not anticipate rebuilding our network. As of December 31, 2017, we have been able to restore service to approximately 340,000 RGUs of our total 738,500 RGUs at Liberty Puerto Rico. Additionally, services to most of our fixed-line customers have not yet been restored in the British Virgin Islands, Dominica and Anguilla. While mobile services have been largely restored in these markets, we are still in the process of completing the restoration of our mobile network infrastructure.

Operating Data Glossary

• | Basic Video Subscriber – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. With the exception of RGUs that we count on an equivalent billing unit (EBU) basis, we count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. We exclude DTH subscribers (as defined below) from basic video subscribers.


• | Direct-to-Home (DTH) Subscriber – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video programming broadcast directly via satellite.


• | Enhanced Video Subscriber – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced video subscribers that are not counted on an EBU basis are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An enhanced video subscriber is not counted as a basic video subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our basic video subscribers equal to the increase in our enhanced video subscribers.


• | Fixed-line Customer Relationships – The number of customers who receive at least one of our video, internet or telephony services that we count as RGUs, without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. To the extent that RGU counts include EBU adjustments, we reflect corresponding adjustments to our customer relationship counts. For further information regarding our EBU calculation, see —Additional General Notes to Table below. Fixed-line customer relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two customer relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from customer relationships.


• | Homes Passed – Homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant, except for DTH homes. Certain of our homes passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. We do not count homes passed for DTH.


• | Internet (Broadband) Subscriber – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Our internet subscribers do not include customers that receive services from dial-up connections.


• | Mobile Subscribers – Our mobile subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop (via a dongle) would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile telephony subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 60 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts.


• | Revenue Generating Unit (RGU) – RGU is separately a basic video subscriber, enhanced video subscriber, DTH subscriber, internet subscriber or telephony subscriber. A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in Chile subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of basic video, enhanced video, DTH, internet and telephony subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers.

I-8


• | Telephony Subscriber – A home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers.


• | Two-way Homes Passed – Homes passed by those sections of our networks that are technologically capable of providing two-way services, including video, internet and telephony services.

Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide telephony, broadband internet, data, video or other B2B services. Certain of our B2B service revenue is derived from small office/home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers.” To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. Due to system limitations, SOHO customers of C&W are not included in our respective RGU and customer counts as of December 31, 2017. With the exception of our B2B SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of B2B services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
Certain of our residential and commercial RGUs are counted on an EBU basis, including residential multiple dwelling units and commercial establishments, such as bars, hotels and hospitals, in Chile and Puerto Rico. Our EBUs are generally calculated by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service. As such, we may experience variances in our EBU counts solely as a result of changes in rates.
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (i) the nature and pricing of products and services, (ii) the distribution platform, (iii) billing systems, (iv) bad debt collection experience and (v) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews.

We believe that our ability to offer our customers greater choice and selection in bundling their services enhances the attractiveness of our service offerings, improves customer retention, minimizes churn and increases overall customer lifetime value.
Residential Services
Mobile Services. We offer mobile services throughout most of our operating footprint. We are a mobile network provider in Panama and most of our Caribbean markets, including the Bahamas and Jamaica. In Chile, we provide mobile services as an MVNO, where VTR leases a third-party’s radio access network. As a mobile network provider, we are able to offer a full range of voice and data services, including value-added services. Where available, we expect our mobile services will allow us to provide an extensive converged product offering with video, internet and fixed-line telephony, allowing our customers connectivity in and out of the home. We hold spectrum licenses as a mobile network provider, with terms typically ranging from 10 to 15 years.
Subscribers to our mobile services pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is bundled with one of our other services or includes mobile data services over their phones, tablets or laptops. Our mobile services are available on a postpaid or prepaid basis, with most customers purchasing a prepaid plan. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets with purchase terms typically related to whether the customer selects a prepaid or postpaid plan. Customers selecting a prepaid plan or service pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally do not enter into a minimum contract term. Customers subscribing to a postpaid plan generally enter into contracts ranging from 12 to 24 months. The long-term contracts are often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. For each SIM card, we typically charge a one-time activation fee to our prepaid customers. Calls within and out of network incur a separate charge if not covered within a prepaid plan or under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services include voice, SMS and internet access via data plans.
I-11

Telephony Services. C&W is the incumbent fixed-line telephony service provider in many of its Caribbean markets. VTR is the second largest residential fixed-line telephony operator, and a leading provider within our footprint.
We offer multi-feature telephony service over our various fixed networks, including cable, FTTx and copper networks. Depending on location, these services are provided via either circuit-switched telephony or voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology. As the need arises, we are replacing obsolete switches with VoIP technology and older copper networks with modern fiber optics, as we continue to develop and invest in new technologies that will enhance our customers’ experiences. These digital telephony services cover international, local and domestic services.
Video Services. We offer video services in Chile, Puerto Rico and in most of our C&W residential markets, including Panama, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and the Bahamas. To meet the demands of our customers, we have enhanced our video services with next generation, market leading digital television platforms that enable our customers to control when and where they watch their programming. These advanced services are delivered over our FTTx, VDSL and hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks and include a digital video recorder (DVR), a video-on-demand (VoD) offering and an advanced electronic programming guide. In certain of our markets, customers can pause their programming while the live broadcast is in progress and access a selection of channels through a mobile application.
In most of our markets, customers have access to VoD, which offers thousands of movies and other video content, including children’s programming, documentaries, adult programming, sports and television series. Our VoD service features content available on a transaction basis and content available within the channel tiers, from basic and premium channels. Customers who subscribe to our video service receive a VoD enabled set-top box without an additional monthly charge. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from leading local and international suppliers.
In Chile, we are currently working to implement Horizon Go, which will extend the advanced video viewing experience to connected devices beyond the set-top box, including mobile phones and tablets. In several of our Caribbean markets and Panama, we offer a comprehensive internet streaming video service (branded “Flow ToGo” and “+TV Go”) that allows our video customers to stream an increasing number of channels with a broadband connection in and out of the home and on multiple devices. In Puerto Rico, our video customers can access over 70 applications from content providers to watch streamed linear and VoD programming by authenticating as a customer. 
All of our operations with fixed video services offer multiple tiers of digital video programming starting with a basic video service (including digital audio channels). In addition, subscribers have the option to select extended and premium subscription tiers. Fixed digital video services require a set-top box provided by us that also enables access to enhanced features such as VoD. Subscribers to our basic video services pay a fixed monthly fee and generally can elect to receive, in most of our markets, a skinny entry tier or take a basic tier with a minimum of 100 video channels, including a number of high definition (HD) channels. We also offer a variety of premium channel packages combining channels and VoD. In the few markets where our analog service is still available, subscribers to that service typically receive fewer channels than subscribers to our basic digital service, with the number of channels dependent on their location. Subscribers to our digital services in each case receive the channels available through our analog service. In all of our video operations, we continue to upgrade our systems to expand our digital services and encourage our remaining analog subscribers to convert to a digital or premium digital service. Discounts to our monthly service fees are generally available to any subscriber who selects a bundled service of at least two of the following services: video, internet and fixed-line telephony.
We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on local programing preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. Our channel offerings include the most relevant content to our subscribers, combining general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyle, news, adult, children and foreign channels, as well as local, regional and international broadcast networks.We also operate channels in the Caribbean, including the leading Caribbean sports network, Flow Sports.
Internet Services. Our customers are increasingly using online communications. To support our customers’ expectations for seamless connectivity, we are expanding our networks to make ultrafast broadband available to more people. This includes investment in the convergence of our fixed and mobile data systems and making wireless systems available in the home. In 2017, we improved the connectivity of over 465,000 homes in Chile, Puerto Rico (prior to the impact of the hurricanes), Panama and other C&W markets through our Network Extension programs (as defined and described below). We initially launched the Connect Box to our subscribers in Chile and Puerto Rico and, in 2017, we began expansion of the Connect Box to various C&W markets. The Connect Box is a next generation WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. This gateway can be self-installed and has an automatic WiFi optimization function, which selects the best possible wireless frequency at any given time.
I-12

The internet speeds we offer are one of our differentiators, as customers spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. As a result, we are continuing to invest in additional bandwidth and technologies to increase internet speeds throughout our Latin America and Caribbean footprint. We have increased the top tier internet speed for our customers in Chile and Puerto Rico to 300 Mbps and, in certain areas of Puerto Rico, download speeds of up to 400 Mbps are available. We have also increased our broadband internet speeds in the C&W footprint following upgrades to our networks, notably in Panama and Jamaica. We plan to continue the upgrade and expansion of our fixed networks so that we can deploy high-speed internet service to additional customers in the coming years.
Our residential subscribers access the internet via DSL over our fixed-line telephony networks, FTTx or hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks and with cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, including personal computers, or wirelessly via the Connect Box. In each of our markets, we offer multiple tiers of internet service. The speed of service depends on location and the tier of service selected by our subscribers.
Our internet service generally includes email, address book and parental controls with value-added services available for additional incremental charges. Our value-added services include security measures and online storage. Mobile broadband internet services are also available through our mobile services described above. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors.
Business Services
C&W is one of the largest business service providers in its markets, and business services represent a significant portion of C&W’s revenue. We offer cloud based integrated communication services, connectivity and wholesale solutions to carriers and businesses throughout the Caribbean and in parts of Latin America via our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks. Our systems include long-haul terrestrial backbone and metro fiber networks that provide access to major commercial zones, wireless carrier cell sites and customers in key markets within our operating footprint. Our networks deliver critical infrastructure for the transit of growing traffic from businesses, governments and other telecommunications operators across the region, particularly to the high-traffic destination of the United States.
I-13

Below is a map of our sub-sea fiber network.
With over 50,000 km of fiber optic cable, and a capacity of over 3 terabytes per second (Tbps), C&W is able to carry large volumes of voice and data traffic on behalf of our customers, businesses and carriers. C&W’s networks also allow us to provide point-to-point, clear channel wholesale broadband capacity services and IP transit, superior switching and routing capabilities and local network services to telecommunications carriers, internet service providers (ISPs) and large corporations. In case of outages on portions of the cable systems, our network provides inbuilt resiliency due to the capability of re-routing traffic. C&W is highly regarded for its wholesale services. At the 2017 MEF Excellence Awards, C&W received the Best Network and Service Innovation in the Caribbean and Latin America Award. In 2017, it was recognized for its innovation and excellence in wholesale services at the 2017 Global Carrier Awards where it received the Best Latin American Wholesale Carrier Award, having won Best Caribbean Wholesale Carrier the previous four years. In 2017, C&W won the Wholesale Service Innovation worldwide award category in the Global Telecom Business Telecoms Innovation Awards.
Our business operations service small and medium business segments as well as larger corporate and enterprise organizations including multi-national companies and governments. We also target specific industry segments, such as financial institutions, the hospitality sector, education institutions and government ministries and agencies. We offer tailored solutions that combine our standard services with value added features, such as dedicated customer care and enhanced service performance monitoring. Our business products and services include voice, broadband, enterprise-grade connectivity, network security, unified communications and a range of cloud based IT solutions, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), disaster recovery and other service offerings. We also offer a range of data, voice and internet services to carriers, ISPs and mobile operators. Our extensive fiber optic cable networks allow us to typically deliver redundant, end-to-end connectivity. It also allows us to provide business customers our services over fiber lines and local networks; thereby, seamlessly connecting businesses anywhere in the region.
Our business services fall into five broad categories:

• | VoIP and circuit-switch telephony, on-premise and hosted private branch exchange solutions and conferencing options, hosted contact center solutions;


• | data services for internet access, virtual private networks, high capacity point-to-point, point-to-multi-point and multi-point-to-multi-point services, managed networking services such as wide area networks and WiFi networks;


• | wireless services for mobile voice and data;

I-14


• | interactive TV service with specialized channel lineups for targeted industries; and


• | value added services, including cloud IT services such as disaster recovery as a service, backup services, and IaaS; managed network security services; and specialized services such as digital signage, retail analytics and location based marketing.

We offer a comprehensive range of information and communication technology solutions to businesses and governmental agencies, including a broad suite of cloud-based services, as well as a suite of commercial grade triple-play services. Our telephony and telecommunication services include flexible call handling, teleconferencing, voice mail and other premium calling features, as well as security, surveillance and backup services. We believe that the extensive reach of our network and assets, as well as our comprehensive set of capabilities means that we are well-positioned to meet the needs of high-value business and government customers that are increasingly searching for a single provider to manage their ever more complex communications, connectivity and information technology needs.
We work with businesses to customize their information and communications services based on the needs of the business. For these tailored services, we enter into individual multi-year agreements. For SOHO and small business customers, we generally enter into standard service agreements with contractually established prices based on the size of the business, the services received and the volume and duration of the services. We also have agreements to provide our services to our business customers over fully managed and monitored network bandwidth, dedicated fiber lines and third-party fiber networks. Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy successfully, customer care is a key driver and, accordingly, we continually strive to improve the capabilities of our shared service support centers.
Technology
In many of our markets, our broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services are transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. This network is composed primarily of fiber networks that are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. In several of our Caribbean markets, our services are transmitted over a fixed network consisting of FTTx, VDSL or copper lines. Over 90% of our networks allow for two-way communications and are flexible enough to support our current services as well as new services.
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. We continue to take actions and explore improvements to our technologies that will increase our capacity and enhance our customers’ connected entertainment experience. These actions include:

• | recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by:


• | increasing the number of nodes in our markets;


• | increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable networks;


• | converting analog channels to digital;


• | bonding additional data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS) 3.0 channels;


• | deploying VDSL over our fixed telephony network;


• | replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and


• | using digital compression technologies.


• | freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services;


• | increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems;


• | enhancing our network to accommodate further business services;


• | using our wireless technologies to extend services outside of the home;


• | offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets;

I-15


• | expanding the availability of next generation decoder boxes (such as Horizon TV) and related products, as well as developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and


• | testing new technologies.

We are engaged in network extension and upgrade programs at C&W, VTR and Liberty Puerto Rico, although the Liberty Puerto Rico program has been interrupted by the impacts of the hurricanes. We collectively refer to these network extension and upgrade programs as the “Network Extensions.” Through the Network Extensions, we are expanding our fixed networks pursuant to which we connect or upgrade homes and businesses to our broadband communications network. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers.
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our various fixed networks, including cable, FTTx and copper networks. These networks are further connected via our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber optic cable networks that provide connectivity within and outside the region. Our sub-sea network cables terminating in the United States carry over 3 Tbps, which represent less than 10% of their potential capacity based on current deployed technology, presenting us with significant growth opportunities. In Puerto Rico, our network includes a fiber ring around the island that provides enhanced interconnectivity points to the island’s other local and international telecommunications companies. The fiber ring provides enhanced interconnectivity points to the island’s other local and international telecommunications companies.
Supply Sources
Content
With telecommunication companies increasingly offering similar services, content is one of the drivers for customers in selecting a video services provider. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that matters the most to our customers. Our content strategy is based on:

• | proposition (meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations on entertainment);


• | product (making available the best content anywhere and anytime);


• | acquisition (investment in the best channels, VoD content and exclusive sports); and


• | partnering (strategic alignment with content partners and growth opportunities).

Except for our Flow Sports and Flow 1 entertainment services in the Caribbean, we license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings through distribution agreements with third-party content providers, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. For such licenses, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per subscriber basis, with minimum guarantees in certain cases through long-term programming licenses. For our distribution agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed channels and programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms including through our apps for IP connected devices and websites. We also acquire rights to make available, in selected markets, basic and/or premium video services to mobile and/or broadband subscribers that are not TV subscribers.
In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney/ESPN, Fox, Time Warner/HBO, Discovery, NBCU and Viacom. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key local broadcasters. For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including Hollywood movies, music, children’s programming, documentaries and local productions.
We also use exclusive content in order to differentiate our video proposition. We operate the leading Caribbean sports network, Flow Sports. Since August 2016, Flow Sports has broadcast all of the Premier League games across our Caribbean markets, excluding Puerto Rico, as part of a three-year exclusive agreement, over a combination of a basic service, Flow Sports (also distributed to other pay TV operators), and a premium service, Flow Sports Premier (available exclusively to our customers). In 2017, Flow Sports announced that it acquired, in partnership with another channel, the rights to the UEFA Champions League and Europa Cup in a three-year agreement from June 2018. Flow Sports also broadcasts the other leading sports in the region, including cricket and track and field. Through the Flow Sports app, our video customers are able to watch Flow Sports content exclusively on-the-go and across multiple screens.
In Chile, we are subject to certain regulatory conditions, which were imposed in connection with VTR’s combination with Metropolis Intercom S.A. in April 2005, including a prohibition on VTR obtaining exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events.
I-16

Mobile Handsets and Customer Premises Equipment
We use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. For other customer premises equipment, we purchase from a number of different suppliers with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers, DVRs, tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer.
Software Licenses
We license software products, including email and security software as well as content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products require us to pay a per subscriber fee for software licenses and a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
Access Arrangements
For our mobile services provided through the MVNO arrangement at VTR, we are dependent on a third- party wireless network provider, with whom we contract to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for this service. Any termination of this arrangement could significantly impact our mobile services provided through VTR.
Regulatory Matters
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the markets in which we operate, and the scope of regulation varies from market to market. Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation, including conditions imposed on us by competition or other authorities as a requirement to close acquisitions or dispositions, could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered and could lead to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. In addition, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing rules and restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content, including content provided by third parties. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.
C&W
The video, broadband and telephony services provided by C&W are subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental and regulatory entities in each of the jurisdictions where such services are provided. The scope and reach of these regulations are distinct in each market. Generally, C&W provides services in accordance with licenses and concessions granted by national authorities pursuant to national telecommunication legislation and associated regulations. Certain of these regulatory requirements are summarized below.
As the incumbent telecommunications provider in many of its jurisdictions, C&W is subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to the provision of fixed-line and mobile telephony services. Generally, in these markets, C&W operates under a government issued license or concession that enables it to own and operate its telecommunication networks, including the establishment of wireless networks and the use of spectrum. These licenses and concessions are typically non-exclusive and have renewable multi-year terms that include competitive, qualitative and rate regulation. Licenses and concessions are scheduled to expire over the next two years in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Barbados. We believe we have complied with all local requirements to have existing licenses renewed and have provided all necessary information to enable local authorities to process applications for renewal in a timely manner. In addition, in some of the ECTEL (as defined below) states we are operating under expired licenses and have applied for renewal of such licenses. We expect that such licenses will be granted or renewed, as applicable, on the same or substantially similar terms and conditions in a timely manner. Pending issuance of new or renewed licenses or concessions, we continue to operate on the same terms and conditions as prior to the licenses expiring. With respect to licenses for mobile spectrum, the initial grant of the spectrum is typically subject to an auction process, but in some cases may be granted on the basis of an administrative process at a set level of fees for a fixed period of time, typically to coincide with carrier licenses, subject to annual fees and compliance with applicable license requirements.
Rate regulation of C&W’s telephony services typically includes price caps that set the maximum rates C&W may charge to customers, or legislation that requires consent from a regulator prior to any price increases. In addition, all regulators determine and set the rates that may be charged by all telephony operators, including C&W, for interconnect charges, access charges between 
I-17

operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. In addition, in certain markets, regulators set, or are seeking to set, mobile roaming rates.
In recent years, a number of markets in which C&W operates have demonstrated an increased interest in regulating various aspects of broadband internet services due to the increasing importance and availability of high speed broadband. As broadband internet access has become a national priority for many of C&W’s markets, national regulators have demonstrated an increased focus on the issues of network resilience, broadband affordability and penetration, quality of services and consumer rights. Certain regulators are also seeking to mandate third-party access to C&W’s network infrastructure, including dark fiber and landing stations, as well as to regulate wholesale services and prices. Any such decision and application to grant access to our network infrastructure may strengthen our competitors by granting them the ability to access our network to offer competing products and services without making the corresponding capital intensive infrastructure investment. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors on favorable economic terms that are not set by the free market could adversely impact our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access ultimately afforded to our network, the pricing mandated by regulatory authorities and other competitive factors or market developments.
As examples of infrastructure sharing, the Office of Utilities Regulation in Jamaica is in the process of conducting a consultation that could result in telecom facilities sharing rules that could require us to share our infrastructure (including dark fiber, ducts, sub-sea cable landing stations and mobile network towers) with third parties, including our competitors without any requirement of making a corresponding capital intensive infrastructure investment. We intend to appeal and dispute any such ruling. In addition, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL), the regulatory body for telecommunications in five Eastern Caribbean States (Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines), has adopted an Electronic Communications Bill that may have a material adverse impact on C&W’s operations in the ECTEL member states. The proposed Electronic Communications Bill includes provisions relating to:

• | net neutrality principles mandating equal access to all content and applications regardless of the source and without favoring, degrading, interrupting, intercepting, blocking access or throttling speeds;


• | subscription television rate regulation;


• | regulations implementing market dominance rules;


• | network unbundling at regulated rates; and


• | mandated unbundled access to all landing station network elements at cost-based rates.

We currently cannot determine the impact these provisions will have on our operations because national regulators are required to conduct extensive market reviews before adopting specific measures and these measures might be reconsidered in accordance with the market reviews. It is currently unclear as to when the new legislation will be enacted. To become law, the legislation will need to be passed by the Parliament of each ECTEL state, and there remains some concerns by St. Lucia and Grenada about the impact of the legislation on operators like C&W. We expect that consensus on the final version of the bill will take some time. As such, the timing and ultimate effect of the bill is unclear.
In Panama, as a result of a public consultation process, the regulator issued new guidelines and new quality goals for the Internet Public Service, by Resolution AN No.11370-Telco of June 26, 2017 and its modification, which went into effect in February 2018.
In addition to rate regulation, several markets in which C&W operates have imposed, or are considering imposing, regulations designed to further encourage competition, including introducing requirements related to unbundling, network access to third parties, and local number portability (LNP). LNP has been implemented in Panama, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica and is currently being contemplated or implemented in other jurisdictions, including Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago.
The pay television service provided in certain C&W markets is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations, data protection laws and regulations, and the must-carry rule (as defined below) and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations.
C&W is subject to universal service obligations in a number of markets. These obligations vary in specificity and extent, but they are generally related to ensuring widespread geographic coverage of networks and that the populations of C&W’s individual markets have access to basic telecommunication services at minimum quality standards. In a number of cases, C&W is required 
I-18

to support universal access/service goals through contributions to universal service funds or participate in universal service-related projects. A bill to modify the Panama Universal Service Law (Law 59) has been submitted for consideration to the National Assembly and a sub-commission has been formed to review it.
Another relevant bill in Panama relates to the consolidation of the Mobile Market, which has been approved in the first reading and pending on the second and third reading in the National Assembly. The proposed bill would allow mobile consolidation to three operators, which is currently set by law at four.
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, C&W’s operating companies must comply with both specific and general legislation concerning, among other matters, data retention, consumer protection and electronic commerce. These operating companies are also subject to national level regulations on competition and on consumer protection.
The C&W Acquisition (as defined below) triggered regulatory approval requirements in certain jurisdictions in which C&W operates. The regulatory authorities in certain of these jurisdictions, including the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and the Seychelles, have not completed their review of the C&W Acquisition or granted their approval. While we expect to receive all outstanding approvals, such approvals may include binding conditions or requirements that could have an adverse impact on C&W’s operations and financial condition.
In Trinidad and Tobago, C&W was required by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT), in connection with TATT’s approval of C&W’s acquisition of Columbus International Inc. in March 2015, to dispose of its 49% shareholding in the Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (TSTT). The disposal of C&W’s stake in TSTT is not complete and the deadline set by TATT for such completion was recently extended to June 30, 2018. We cannot predict when, or if, we will be able to dispose of this investment at an acceptable price. As such, no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the carrying value of our investment in TSTT.
Chile
VTR is subject to regulation and enforcement by various governmental entities in Chile including the Chilean Antitrust Authority, the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (the Ministry) through the Chilean Undersecretary of Telecommunications (SubTel), the National Television Council (CNTV) and the National Consumer Service (Sernac).
In addition to the specific regulations described below, VTR is subject to certain regulatory conditions which were imposed by the Chilean Antitrust Authority in connection with VTR’s combination with Metrópolis Intercom SA in April 2005. These conditions are indefinite and include, among others, (i) prohibiting VTR and its control group from participating, directly or indirectly through a related person, in Chilean satellite or microwave television businesses, (ii) prohibiting VTR from obtaining exclusive broadcast rights, except for specific events, and (iii) requiring VTR to offer its broadband capacity for resale of internet services on a wholesale basis.
Video. The provision of pay television services requires a permit issued by the Ministry. Cable pay television permits are granted for an indefinite term and are non-exclusive. As these permits do not involve radio electric spectrum, they are granted without ongoing duties or royalties. VTR has permits to provide cable pay television services in the major cities, including Santiago, and in most of the medium-sized markets in Chile.
Cable television service providers in Chile are free to define the channels and content included in their services and are not required to carry any specific programming, except as described below. However, CNTV may impose sanctions on providers who are found to have run programming containing excessive violence, pornography or other objectionable content. Pay television operators are directly responsible for violation of such prohibitions. Additionally, the Chilean Television Act (the Television Act) requires pay television operators to offer a certain quota of cultural content and to distribute public interest campaigns.
The Television Act establishes a retransmission consent regime between broadcast television concessionaires and pay television operators. This regime provides that once a broadcast operator achieves digital coverage of 85% of the population within its concession areas, the broadcast operator may require that pay television operators enter into an agreement for the retransmission of its digital signal. In addition, the Television Act requires that the technical or commercial conditions imposed by broadcast operators not discriminate among pay television operators. Also, the Television Act establishes a must carry regime requiring pay television operators to distribute up to four local broadcast television channels in each operating area. The channels that must be carried by any particular pay television operator are to be selected by CNTV. The full implementation of the retransmission and must carry regimes are still pending.
VTR’s ability to change its channel lineup is restricted by an agreement reached with Sernac in July 2012 and the general regulation established by SubTel in February 2014 (by the Telecommunication Services General Rulemaking). This framework 
I-19

allows VTR to change one or more channels from its lineup after a 60-day notice period to its subscribers. In such cases, VTR shall offer a channel of similar content and quality or a proportional compensation. Despite this, after certain channel adjustments were applied in July 2016, the excluded programmers as well as social media have questioned VTR’s ability to unilaterally modify its channel grid, arguing that content and quality of new channels should be identical to the excluded channels. A final position on this issue is pending.
Internet. A law passed in November 2017 requires all ISPs to apply for a public service concession for data transmission within three months of the passage of such law. Because VTR operates via networks that were previously approved by SubTel, VTR will use a fast-track procedure with respect to this concession.
A law on internet neutrality prohibits “arbitrary blockings” of legal content, applications or services and the provision of differentiated service conditions according to the origin or ownership of the content or service provided through the internet. Additionally, the law authorizes ISPs to take measures to ensure the privacy of their users and provide virus protection and safety processes over their network, as long as these measures do not infringe antitrust laws. Additional measures have been implemented, including obligations related to consumer information, traffic management policies, internet quality of service requirements and notices required by law concerning the effective maximum and minimum traffic speeds offered under internet access plans.
In order to protect the constitutional rights of privacy and safety of communications, ISPs are prohibited from undertaking surveillance measures over data content on their networks. Also, special summary proceedings have been created in order to safeguard intellectual property rights against violations committed through networks or digital systems. These proceedings include measures designed to withdraw, disqualify or block infringing content in the ISP’s network or systems. The law also provides for the right of intellectual property owners to judicially request from ISPs the delivery of necessary information to identify the provider of infringing content.
A law passed in November 2017 requires all fixed and mobile ISPs to meet levels of quality of service to be defined in a future SubTel regulation. The law also requires ISPs to guarantee a minimum broadband throughput based on the offered speed and to provide their subscribers a certified measurement tool allowing subscribers to verify this minimum service level, and imposes on ISPs fines or penalties if the service level is not fulfilled.
Fixed-Line Telephony and Mobile Services. The provision of fixed-line telephony and mobile services requires a public telecommunications service concession. With respect to mobile services, in 2009, SubTel awarded VTR a license for 30 MHz of spectrum in the 1700/2100 MHz frequency band for the provision of wireless telephony services. The license has a 30-year renewable term. On January 15, 2014, SubTel initiated a proceeding against VTR based on its having allegedly “altered an essential element of its concession, particularly the type of service.” In this proceeding, SubTel asserted that VTR was not in compliance with the terms of its wireless license. SubTel alleged that the terms of the wireless license require VTR to comply with certain minimum network coverage and traffic levels. VTR disagreed with SubTel’s assertions regarding the terms of the wireless license and contested such assertions vigorously. The maximum possible sanctions include “the termination of the concession.” The final ruling regarding this case is still pending.
VTR has concessions to provide fixed-line telephony in most major and medium-sized markets in Chile. Telephony concessions are non-exclusive and have renewable 30-year terms. The original term of VTR’s fixed- line telephony concessions expires in November 2025. Long distance telephony services are considered intermediate telecommunications services and, as such, are also regulated by the Ministry. VTR has concessions to provide this service, which is non-exclusive, for a 30-year renewable term expiring in September 2025.
There are no universal service obligations in Chile. However, local service concessionaires are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers that are within their service area or are willing to pay for an extension to receive service. All local service providers, including VTR, must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network connections at regulated prices and must interconnect with all other public service concessionaires whose systems are technically compatible.
As a general rule, fixed-line telephony service providers are free to establish the rates directly charged to their customers, unless the Chilean Antitrust Authority concludes that due to a lack of sufficient competition in the market, rates should be fixed by SubTel. However, SubTel sets the maximum rates that may be charged by each operator for interconnect charges, access charges between operators for calls originating on one network that are completed through connections with one or more networks of other providers, and charges for network unbundling services. Rate regulation on interconnection charges is applicable to all fixed-line and mobile telephony companies, including VTR. The determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by operators for their fixed-line or mobile services are made on a case-by-case basis by SubTel and are effective for five years.
I-20

Other Chilean Regulation
Price Increase. The Consumer Rights Protection Law has been interpreted to require that any raise in rates exceeding inflation must be previously accepted and agreed to by subscribers. Although VTR disagrees with this interpretation, in July 2012, VTR reached an agreement with Sernac that permits VTR to make adjustments to its published prices twice per year to adjust for inflation, except those services that are subject to rate regulation. VTR is generally prohibited from increasing the rates over the inflation adjustment. VTR may, however, cancel a subscriber’s contract after 12 months and propose a new contract with new rate provisions. Once a year VTR may propose to its existing subscribers additional changes to their rates, which must be accepted by the subscriber for the rates to go into effect.
Bundling. In 2012, the Chilean Antitrust Authority issued its regulation governing the on-net/off-net pricing practice in the mobile industry and the offering of bundled telecommunication services. Pursuant to the terms of this regulation, as revised by the Chilean Supreme Court, mobile services may be sold jointly with fixed-line services. However, promotional discounts are not permitted for these double-play offers. As for traditional bundling over the same platform (e.g., bundled fixed-line services such as our double-play and triple-play packages, or bundled mobile services), this regulation provides that such services may be bundled, subject to certain price limitations. These limitations require that the total price for a bundle must be greater than the standalone price for the most expensive service included in the bundle. Also, when three or more services are bundled, the price for the bundle must be greater than the sum of the standalone prices for each service in the bundle, excluding the lowest priced service.
Telecommunication Services Proposal. In February 2014, SubTel published a General Telecommunication Services Ruling that regulates the offer of telecommunication services, including voice, internet access, and pay television, either alone or in bundles, from a consumer protection point of view. The regulation introduced service billing, significant changes in contracts with customers, requirements regarding compensation in case of service failure, and rules regarding treatment of customers’ personal information.
Minimum Standards on Quality of Service and Operation. Since 2013, SubTel has been drafting a proposed regulation regarding the Technical Fundamental Plan on Maintenance and Public Service Telecommunications Network Managing. This draft seeks to impose minimum standards on quality of service and operation of telecommunications networks, in general, and in some particular services: voice services; text and multimedia messages services; data transmission services; minimum coverage for mobile services; and digital terrestrial television minimum coverage. We are uncertain when SubTel will publish the final version of the plan.
Consumer’s Rights Protection Law Amendment. In 2017, the Chilean Congress passed a bill assigning significant new powers to Sernac including a material increase in its ability to levy fines and compensations. However, it remains uncertain how or whether Sernac and SubTel will redefine their respective powers.
Puerto Rico
Liberty Puerto Rico is subject to regulation in Puerto Rico by various governmental entities at the Puerto Rico and the U.S. federal level, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (TRB), which was established in 1996, has primary regulatory jurisdiction in Puerto Rico at the local level and is responsible for awarding franchises to cable operators for the provision of cable service in Puerto Rico and regulating cable television and telecommunications services.
Our business in Puerto Rico is subject to comprehensive regulation under the United States Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), which regulates communication, telecommunication and cable television services. The Communications Act also provides the general legal framework for, among other things, the provision of telephone services, services related to interconnection between telephone carriers, and television, radio, cable television and direct broadcast satellite services.
The FCC and/or the TRB have the authority to impose sanctions, including warnings, fines, license revocations and, in certain specific cases, termination of the franchise, although license revocation and franchise termination are rare. The Communications Act specifies causes for the termination of FCC licenses, including, for example, the failure to comply with license requirements and conditions or to pay fines or fees in a timely manner. Such sanctions by the TRB and/or FCC can be appealed to, and reviewed by, Puerto Rican courts and U.S. federal courts.
In Puerto Rico, antitrust regulation is governed by the U.S. Sherman Act, other federal antitrust legislation, and the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Law. In particular, the Sherman Act seeks to prevent anti-competitive practices in the marketplace and requires governmental review of certain business combinations, among other things. The Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Law substantially 
I-21

parallels the Sherman Act and authorizes the Puerto Rico Department of Justice to investigate and impose competition-related conditions on transactions.
Puerto Rico Law 5 of 1973, as amended, created the Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates marketing campaigns, publicity, and breach of service contracts, and prohibits false advertising. The Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Law 213), which created the TRB, requires that rates for telecommunication services be cost-based, forbids cross-subsidies and focuses on encouraging, preserving and enforcing competition in the cable and telecommunications markets. Although Law 213 does not require Liberty Puerto Rico to obtain any approval of rate increases for cable television or telecommunication services, any such increases must be in compliance with Law 213’s requirements, including notification to the TRB before such increases take effect.
The video, internet and fixed-line telephony services that Liberty Puerto Rico provides are all subject to regulation:

• | Video. The provision of cable television services requires a franchise issued by the TRB. Franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach or failure to comply with certain material provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing a franchisee’s system operations, although such terminations are rare. In addition, franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the grant of authority. Franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non- compliance. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of up to ten years and must be periodically renewed.

Our pay television service in Puerto Rico is subject to, among other things, subscriber privacy regulations and must-carry and retransmission consent rights of broadcast stations. The Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the carriage relationship between broadcast television stations and cable companies. To ensure that every qualifying local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every qualifying full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems transmit that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the “must-carry” rule) pursuant to the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. Alternatively, a station may elect every three years to forego its must carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local cable system, referred to as retransmission consent.

• | Internet. Liberty Puerto Rico offers high-speed internet access throughout its entire footprint. In March 2015, the FCC issued an order classifying mass-market broadband internet access service as a “telecommunications service,” changing its long-standing treatment of this offering as an “information service,” which the FCC traditionally has subjected to limited regulation. The rules adopted by the FCC prohibited, among other things, broadband providers from: (i) blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (ii) impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (iii) favoring some lawful internet traffic over other lawful internet traffic in exchange for consideration (collectively, 2015 Restrictions). In addition, the FCC prohibited broadband providers from unreasonably interfering with users’ ability to access lawful content or use devices that do not harm the network, or with edge providers’ ability to disseminate their content, and imposed more detailed disclosure obligations on broadband providers than were previously in place. On December 14, 2017, the FCC adopted a Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order (the 2017 Order) that, in large part, reversed the regulations issued by the FCC in 2015. The 2017 Order, among other things, restores the classifications of broadband Internet access as an information service under Title I of the Communications Act, and mobile broadband Internet access service as a private mobile service, and eliminates the 2015 Restrictions. The 2017 Order does require ISPs to disclose information to consumers regarding practices such as throttling, paid prioritization and affiliated prioritization, and restores broadband consumer protection authority to the Federal Trade Commission. The formal period for filing petitions for judicial review of the 2017 Order in federal court and petitions for reconsideration at the FCC will begin on the date that a summary of the 2017 Order is published in the Federal Register, which has not occurred. A number of state Attorneys General and public interest groups already have filed preliminary appeals of the 2017 Order in federal courts. Additional judicial appeals and petitions for reconsideration of the 2017 Order likely will be filed in federal courts and at the FCC, respectively, during the formal filing period. Legislative proposals regarding the net neutrality rules also are pending in Congress.


• | Fixed-Line Telephony Services. Liberty Puerto Rico offers fixed-line telephony services, including both circuit-switched telephony and VoIP. Its circuit-switched telephony services are subject to FCC and local regulations regarding the quality and technical aspects of service. All local telecommunications providers, including Liberty Puerto Rico, are obligated to provide telephony service to all customers within the service area, subject to certain exceptions under FCC regulations, and must give long distance telephony service providers equal access to their network. Under the Communications Act, competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), like us, may require interconnection with the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC), and the ILEC must negotiate a reasonable and nondiscriminatory interconnection agreement with the

I-22

CLEC. Such arrangement requires the ILEC to interconnect with the CLEC at any technically feasible point within the ILEC’s network, provide access to unbundled network elements of the ILEC’s network, offer for resale at wholesale rates any telecommunication services the ILEC provides to its own retail clients, and allow physical collocation of the CLEC’s equipment in the ILEC’s facilities to permit interconnection or access to unbundled network element services. Therefore, we have the right to interconnect with the incumbent local exchange carrier Puerto Rico Telcom (PRTC). We have negotiated an interconnection agreement with PRTC, and the physical interconnection between both companies has been activated.
All of the circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services of Liberty Puerto Rico are subject to a charge for the Federal Universal Service Fund (USF), which is a fund created under the Communications Act to subsidize telecommunication services in high-cost areas, to provide telecommunications services for low-income consumers, and to provide certain subsidies for schools, libraries and rural healthcare facilities. The FCC has redirected the focus of USF to support broadband deployment in high-cost areas. In addition, our circuit-switched telephony and VoIP services are subject to a charge for a local Puerto Rico Universal Service Fund, which was created by law to subsidize telecommunications services for low-income families under the Federal USF Lifeline and Link-Up programs.
The FCC has adopted other regulations for VoIP services, including the requirement that interconnected VoIP providers and facilities-based broadband internet access providers must comply with the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires carriers to provide certain assistance to federal law enforcement authorities. VoIP providers are also required to offer basic and enhanced 911 emergency calling services, which requires disclosure to all VoIP customers. VoIP providers are also subject to federal customer proprietary network information rules related to customer privacy.
Competition
We operate in an emerging region of the world, where market penetration of telecommunication services such as broadband and mobile data is lower than in more developed markets. Generally, our markets are at a nascent stage of the global shift to a “data-centric” world. Although there has been strong growth in data consumption in our key markets, data consumption in our operating regions still lags significantly when compared to international benchmarks. We believe that we have the opportunity to capitalize upon this underlying growth trend in the majority of our markets, and benefit from increasing penetration of our data services, as well as economic growth, in all of our markets.
However, technological advances and product innovations have increased and are likely to continue to increase giving customers several options for the provision of their telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication services that allow for seamless connectivity. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide converged services, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products and services. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our telecommunications services by focusing on customer service, competitive pricing and offering quality high-speed internet.
Mobile and Telephony Services
Consumers are increasingly moving to mobile services. In many of our markets we are either the leading or one of the leading mobile providers, except in Chile where we are a relatively new entrant in the provision of mobile services. In the markets where we are one of the top mobile providers, we continue to seek additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and increase our LTE services. We face competition in all of our markets. We also offer various calling plans, such as unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver. In several of our markets, we expect to increase focus on converged services, including mobile, fixed-line, broadband and video. We are also exploring opportunities to offer mobile services in markets where we currently only deliver fixed products and mobility applications to our other services.
The market for fixed-line telephony services is mature in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. In most of our C&W markets, we are the incumbent telecommunications provider with long established customer relationships. In our other markets, our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operator in the applicable market. In these markets, the incumbent operators have substantially more experience in providing fixed-line telephony, greater resources to devote to the provision of such services and long-standing customer relationships. In all of our markets, we also compete with VoIP operators offering services across broadband lines and over-the-top (OTT) telephony providers, such as WhatsApp. In many 
I-23

countries, our businesses also face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers.
Competition exists in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony products due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and other regulatory action, such as general price competition. Carrier pre-select allows the end user to choose the voice services of operators other than the incumbent while using the incumbent’s network. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination.” Our portfolio of calling plans includes a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone applications that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages on smart phones. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard.
VTR faces competition from the incumbent telecommunications operator, Movistar (as defined below), and other telecommunications operators. Movistar has substantial experience in providing telephony services, resources to devote to the provision of telephony services and long-standing customer relationships. Price is a key factor as are bundles with quality services. We distinguish our services by delivering reliable market leading internet access speeds with attractive bundled offers.
Movistar, Claro (as defined below) and Entel (as defined below) are the primary companies that offer mobile telephony in Chile. In mid-2015, WOM S.A. (WOM) entered the mobile services market through its acquisition of the Nextel Chile network. WOM is exerting significant competitive pressure in the mobile market with its very aggressive price offers. Such pricing is driving down sales and increasing churn in the mobile market. As an MVNO, VTR offers its mobile services on a standalone basis. To attract and retain customers, VTR focuses on its triple-play customer base, offering them postpaid mobile accounts at an attractive price.
With respect to mobile services, we face competition from Digicel Group Ltd. (Digicel) in most of our C&W residential markets and in Panama. We also compete with subsidiaries of Telefónica, S.A. (e.g., the incumbent Chilean telecommunications operator under the brand name Movistar (Movistar)) and América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (Claro) in Chile and Panama. In addition, in the Bahamas, where C&W had previously been the only provider of mobile services, competition has increased significantly due to the commercial launch of mobile services by a competitor during the fourth quarter of 2016. We also face competition in the provision of broadband services from Cable Onda S.A. (Cable Onda) in Panama, Digicel in our Caribbean markets and Cable Bahamas Limited (Cable Bahamas) in the Bahamas. These companies all have competitive pricing on similar services, and the intensified level of competition we are experiencing in several of our markets has added increased pressure on the pricing of our services. To attract and retain customers, C&W focuses on providing quality services and premium content, as well as converged services where customers can access content in and out-of-the home.
Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional free-to-air (FTA) broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers and other fixed-line telecommunications carriers and broadband providers, including operations offering (i) services over hybrid fiber coaxial networks, (ii) DTH satellite services, (iii) internet protocol television (IPTV) over broadband internet connections using asymmetric DSL or VDSL or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring,” (iv) IPTV over FTTx networks, or (v) LTE Services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable or FTTx based providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems.
OTT aggregators utilizing our or our competitors’ high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video aggregators (such as HBO Go, Amazon Prime and Netflix) offer VoD service for television series and movies, catch-up television and linear channels from broadcasters. In some cases, these OTT services are provided free-of-charge. The content library of such services is offered on an unlimited basis for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. To enhance our competitive position, we are developing cloud-based, next generation user interfaces based on advanced technologies and are providing our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events.
Piracy and other unauthorized uses and distribution of content, including through web-based OTT applications, devices and online platforms, also present challenges for our video business. These platforms illegally stream copyrighted content, for example, Premier League games that can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection. While piracy is a challenge in most jurisdictions 
I-24

in which we operate, it is particularly prevalent in jurisdictions that lack developed copyright laws and effective enforcement of copyright laws.
We believe that our deep-fiber access, where available, provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks allow us to concurrently deliver internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure in most of our footprint allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our mobile networks, together with our fixed fiber-rich networks, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. In response to the continued growth in OTT viewing, we have launched a number of innovative video services, including Flow ToGo and +TV Go in a number of C&W markets.
Our ability to continue to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content and services on acceptable terms and to have such content available on multiple devices and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain sports programs, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors also have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with those companies. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service.
In this competitive environment, we enhance our offers with advanced digital services, such as DVR functionality, HD channels, VoD and multiscreen services. In addition, we offer attractive content packages tailored to the particular market and discounts for bundled services. To improve the quality of the programming in our packages, our operations periodically modify their digital channel offerings. Where mobile is available, we are focusing on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. We use these services, as well as bundles of our fixed-line services, as a means of driving video and other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services.

• | C&W. C&W competes with a variety of pay TV service providers, with several of these competitors offering double-play and triple-play packages. Fixed-mobile convergence services are not a significant factor in most of C&W’s residential markets. In several of C&W’s other markets, including Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, C&W is the largest or one of the largest video service providers. In these markets, C&W’s primary competition is from DTH providers, such as DIRECTV Latin America Holdings, Inc. (DirecTV), and operators of IPTV services over VDSL and FTTx, such as Digicel. In Panama, C&W competes primarily with Cable Onda, which offers video, internet and fixed-line telephony over its cable network, and with the DTH services of Claro Americas. To compete effectively, C&W invests in leading mobile and fixed networks, and in content, where the Premier League is a main attraction for Flow Sports.


• | VTR. VTR competes primarily with DTH service providers, including the incumbent Chilean telecommunications operator Movistar, Claro Chile S.A., a subsidiary of Claro, Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. (Entel), GTD Manquehue (GTD) and DirecTV, among others. Movistar offers double-play and triple-play packages using DTH for video and DSL for internet and fixed-line telephony and offers mobile services. On a smaller scale, Movistar also offers IPTV services over FTTx networks in Chile. Claro offers triple-play packages using DTH and, in most major cities in Chile, through a hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. It also offers mobile services. To a lesser extent, VTR also competes with video services offered by or over networks of fixed-line telecommunication providers using DSL technology. To compete effectively, VTR focuses on enhancing its subscribers viewing options in and out of the home. It offers VoD, catch-up television, DVR functionality, Horizon TV and a variety of premium channels. These services and its variety of bundled options, including internet and telephony, enhance VTR’s competitive position.


• | Liberty Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico is the largest provider of fixed-line video services in Puerto Rico. Liberty Puerto Rico’s primary competition for video customers is from DTH satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network Corporation (Dish Network). Dish Network is an aggressive competitor, offering low introductory offers, free HD channels and, in its top tier packages, a multi-room DVR service for free. DirecTV is also a significant competitor offering similar programming in Puerto Rico compared to Dish Network. In order to compete, Liberty Puerto Rico focuses on offering video packages with attractive programming, including HD and Spanish language channels, plus a specialty video package of Spanish-only channels that has gained popularity. In addition, Liberty Puerto Rico uses its bundled offers that include high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps to drive its video services.

I-25

Internet
With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet services using cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband internet services. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to homes and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is a competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE wireless networks. In addition, other wireless technologies, such as WiFi, are available in almost all of our markets. In this intense competitive environment, speed and pricing are key drivers for customers.
Our strategy is speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections as well as offering varying tiers of service, prices and a variety of bundled product offerings and a range of value added services. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our top download speeds generally range from 100 Mbps to speeds of up to 300 Mbps. In Barbados, we also have speeds of up to 1 Gbps available. In many of our markets, we offer the highest download speeds available via our cable and FTTx networks. The focus is on high-end internet products to safeguard our high-end customer base and allow us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing the technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.0 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with local FTTx initiatives and create a competitive advantage compared to DSL infrastructures and LTE initiatives on a national level. With the commercial deployment of our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 on our cable networks, we plan to further increase our high-speed internet offers.
In several of our C&W markets, we are the incumbent phone company offering broadband internet products using various DSL-based technologies. In these markets and our other Latin American markets, our key competition for internet services is from cable and IPTV operators and mobile data service providers. To compete effectively, we are expanding our LTE service areas and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service through bundled offerings that include video and fixed-line telephony. We also offer a wide range of mobile products either on a prepaid or postpaid basis.

• | C&W. Where C&W is the incumbent telecommunications provider, it competes with cable operators, the largest of which are Cable Onda in Panama and Cable Bahamas in the Bahamas. To a lesser extent, C&W experiences competition from Digicel in certain of its markets. To distinguish itself from these competitors, C&W uses its bundled offers with video and telephony to promote its broadband internet services.


• | VTR. VTR faces competition primarily from non-cable-based ISPs, such as Movistar and Entel, and from other cable-based providers, such as Claro and GTD. Competition is particularly intense with each of these companies offering competitively priced services, including bundled offers with high-speed internet services. Mobile broadband competition is significant as well. Movistar, Claro and Entel have launched LTE networks for high-speed mobile data. To compete effectively, VTR is expanding its two-way coverage and offering attractive bundling with fixed-line telephony and digital video service and high-speed internet with download speeds of up to 300 Mbps.

Business and Wholesale Services
Through C&W, we provide a variety of advanced, point-to-point, clear channel broadband capacity, IP, Multiprotocol Label Switching, Ethernet and managed services over our owned and operated, technologically advanced, sub-sea fiber optic cable network. Our sub-sea and terrestrial fiber routes combine to form a series of fully integrated networks that typically provide complete operational redundancy, stability and reliability, allowing us in most cases to provide our clients with superior service and minimal network downtime. Given the advanced technical state of the network combined with the challenges in securing the necessary governmental and environmental licenses in all of our operating markets, we believe the network is unlikely to be replicated in the region. Competing networks in the region connect fewer countries than we do and are either linear in design, or if ringed, have high latency protection routes. In addition, our network as of December 31, 2017, utilized less than 10% of its design capacity, and we believe that our ability to take advantage of this large unused carrying capacity, as well as the financial and time investment required to build a similar network, and the potential delays associated with acquiring governmental permissions, makes it unlikely that our network will be replicated in the near term.
I-26

We compete in the provision of B2B services with residential telecommunications operators as noted above, in addition to regional and international service providers, particularly when addressing larger customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 10,300 full-time equivalent employees, certain of whom belong to organized unions and works council. We believe that our employee relations are good.
