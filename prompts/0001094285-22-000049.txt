Customers
We have a large number of customers in the various industries we serve. No commercial customer in 2021 or 2020 accounted for more than 3% of total net sales or more than 10% of any segment’s net sales.
Sales to international customers accounted for approximately 47% of total sales in 2021 compared with 45% in 2020. In both 2021 and 2020, we sold products to customers in over 100 foreign countries. Approximately 90% of our net sales to international customers during 2021 were made to customers in 30 foreign countries. In 2021, the top five countries for sales to international customers, ranked by net sales, were China, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and France and represented approximately 20% of our total net sales.
Approximately 26% of our total net sales for both 2021 and 2020 were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):
U.S. Government sales by segment: | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Digital Imaging | $ | 515.9 | | | $ | 120.9 | | $ | 107.4
Instrumentation | 91.6 | | | 80.6 | | | 80.4 
Aerospace and Defense Electronics | 227.2 | | | 229.9 | | | 225.3
Engineered Systems | 358.4 | | | 386.8 | | | 346.7
Total U.S. Government sales | $ | 1,193.1 | | | $ | 818.2 | | $ | 759.8

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense, which totaled approximately $876.6 million and $578.4 million of our total net sales for 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Mission Operations and Integration (“MO&I”) contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented 1.0% and 1.5% of our total net sales, respectively. 
As described in greater detail under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S. Government. In 2021, approximately 76% of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to 67% in 2020. Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price. Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance. Additionally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government at its convenience, without identification of any 
default. When contracts are terminated for convenience, we can recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination. We had no U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience or default in 2021 or 2020.
Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Generally, most raw materials used in our operations are readily available; however, during 2021, we experienced supply chain constraints and price volatility on some raw materials. While the current supply chain constraints have not significantly affected our business, to reduce current and future supply disruptions, we have implemented short-term and long-term supplier actions to reduce disruptions and prioritize mitigation. Some raw materials are purchased from a limited set of suppliers, including international sources, due to technical capability, price, and other factors. We leverage our existing supplier relationships and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our purchases. Prices of certain key raw materials and electronic components are expected to fluctuate in the future. We mitigate raw material cost increases with long-term supply agreements, customer price increases, and isolating the market driven raw material component of the products we buy. We anticipate that supply chain constraints for some raw materials will continue in 2022. However, we believe our short-term and long-term supplier actions position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses. 
Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments. A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships. Given the technical nature of our products, we conduct our domestic and international marketing
activities through a direct internal sales force, as well as third-party sales representatives and distributors, both in the United
States and in other countries.
Competition
Because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of
competitors, none of which we believe offer the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive. With regard to our defense businesses, it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among several companies, including competitors. Our businesses vigorously compete on quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.
Intellectual Property
We own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights. We are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us. We do not consider any single patent or trademark, or any group
of them, essential either to Teledyne’s business as a whole or to any one of our reportable segments. The annual royalties
received or paid under license agreements are not significant to any of our reportable segments or to Teledyne’s overall
operations.
Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Environment and Other Government Regulations
Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth under “Other Matters – Environmental” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition” and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. No material capital expenditures relating to environmental or other government regulatory compliance are presently anticipated.
Sustainability
Teledyne continues to focus on developing solutions to address sustainability and climate challenges facing humanity today. Many of our products directly support sustainability and climate challenges. We provide a broad range of precision measurement technologies for environmental monitoring and climate research. Our sensors and instruments are deployed everywhere, in space, on aircraft and drones, on land, on the sea surface, in the water column, and on the seafloor. They operate around the clock, measuring greenhouse gases from space, precisely monitoring air and water quality throughout the world, and continuously profiling all of Earth’s oceans. Applications of our instruments provide scientists information that spans time from the origin of the universe to providing real-time data regarding air pollution and dangerous storms, such as time-critical warning of hurricanes and tsunamis.
Recently, the prominence and importance of sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives have dramatically increased. In February 2022, we published our inaugural Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) report, in which we disclose and highlight some of Teledyne’s most recent efforts focused and sustainability and ESG. The CSR report is available at the Corporate Social Responsibility link on our website at www.teledyne.com under the tab “Who We Are”. 
In 2021, we compiled the first global inventory of our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions (starting with fiscal year 2020) and are developing a GHG monitoring and management plan. We have set a goal to reduce our combined direct emissions (“Scope 1”) and indirect emissions from purchased energy (“Scope 2”) in company operations, normalized for revenue, by 40% from 2020 levels by the end of 2040. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate our emission reduction goals, while at the same time providing the tools and technologies enabling environmental science and climatology across the globe. More information about our carbon footprint and GHG emission reduction efforts and goals, and the contributions that Teledyne products make to carbon monitoring and environmental and climate science, can be found in our CSR report.
Please note that information posted or accessible through websites referenced in this report is not incorporated by reference or otherwise included in this report.
Board Oversight
Pursuant to the mandate in their respective charters, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) regularly reviews matters related to compliance with environmental laws and the health and safety of employees, and the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board reviews and evaluates our policies and practices and monitors our efforts in areas of legal and social responsibility, diversity and sustainability, and other ESG matters. The Audit Committee also oversees risk management, including the impact of climate change-related risks.
Human Capital
We consider our relations with our employees to be good. At January 2, 2022, our total workforce consisted of approximately 14,500 employees in more than 38 countries. Workforce demographics for various regions are provided below:

We have a stable and long-tenured workforce. In 2021, our voluntary employee turnover (excluding reductions in force) was approximately 10%. As of January 2, 2022, the average years of service of our employees was approximately 10 years.
Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
Employees are vital to the success of our innovation-driven growth strategy. We are focused on attracting, developing, and retaining employees through competitive compensation and benefits, workforce and management development, diversity and inclusion initiatives, succession planning, corporate culture and leadership quality. 
In 2020, we formed a committee to oversee our equality, diversity and inclusion efforts. We are committed to building a more diverse and inclusive workplace, and we actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. We are piloting an anonymized review/resume redaction process and we expanded our recruitment sources to attract more diverse candidates. We work with many outreach programs, including the National Society of Black Engineers and the Society of Women Engineers. We also began working with INROADS, a non-profit organization that creates pathways to careers for ethnically diverse high school and college students across the country, to improve our access to diverse candidates.
We regularly review our policies, processes and practices to ensure that they promote inclusivity for all applicants and employees. We continue to focus on several activities and initiatives to actively increase diverse representation and progression within our company. We advertise vacancies and strive to recruit the best possible candidate for the role. 
Employee Well-Being
The health and wellness of our employees is a critical component to the success of our business. Many of our larger facilities have on-site fitness centers and encourage healthy choices with various wellness challenge programs. These programs often include guest speakers on various topics, including mental health, heart disease, diabetes, and personal financial awareness. We also have vacation and sick leave policies that provide employees with flexibility to take time away from work for relaxation or to recover from illness. U.S. based employees have access to third-party counseling and mental health services at no cost to the employee when life events impact an employee. 
Talent Acquisition
We appreciate the benefits of diversity and support programs increasing the inclusion of underrepresented and minority groups, including the enablement of persons with disabilities, and the advancement of women in professional fields, particularly in science, technology, engineering and math (“STEM”). We work with various organizations to increase diversity in our pool of available candidates to fill our STEM-based and other hard-to-fill positions. 
As part of our outreach and development efforts for women in the science, technology, and engineering fields, we have participated in the Women in Science and Engineering Conference for Girls in various locations in the U.S. We have also been a consistent sponsor of the Young Woman Engineer of the Year Awards in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). This event helps young students, school leavers and degree students understand more about engineering by learning about day-to-day jobs and personal experiences. It is also designed to encourage young talent to pursue a career in STEM.
Talent Development
We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation of leaders. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review for all segment, business unit, and function leaders, focusing on our high performing and high potential talent, diversity and succession for our most critical roles. From this review, individualized development and retention programs are implemented or revised as needed. We also provide additional opportunities for our existing employees to enhance their careers. We invest in employee skills development in various ways, including through educational expense reimbursement. These reimbursements help employees advance their education. Specialized training in a job related field gives employees new skills and a strong foundation of knowledge that can serve them throughout their career and that may allow them to progress to more responsible positions at Teledyne. In 2020, we launched Teledyne University, a learning platform for employees. The database of courses, webinars, and certification programs has hundreds of targeted training programs on management, technical competencies, soft skills development, and compliance.
