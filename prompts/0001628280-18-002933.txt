Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of network solutions to telecommunications, wireless and cable service providers and enterprises across industry verticals. With over 1,000 customers around the globe, including some of the largest telecommunications service providers and enterprises in the world, we enable service providers and enterprises to modernize their communications networks and provide secure RTC solutions to their customers and employees. By securing and enabling reliable and scalable IP networks, we help service providers and enterprises adopt the next generation of software-based virtualized and cloud communications technologies to drive new, incremental revenue while protecting their existing revenue streams. Our solutions provide a secure way for our customers to connect and leverage multivendor, multiprotocol communications systems and applications across their networks and the cloud, around the world and in a rapidly changing ecosystem of IP-enabled devices such as smartphones and tablets. In addition, our solutions secure the evolution to cloud-based delivery of UC solutions - both for service providers transforming to a cloud-based network and for enterprises using cloud-based UC. We go to market through both direct sales and indirect channels globally, leveraging the assistance of resellers, and we provide ongoing support to our customers through a global services team with experience in design, deployment and maintenance of some of the world's largest IP networks.
We recently completed our Merger with GENBAND in October 2017. As a result of the Merger, we believe we are better positioned to enable network transformations to IP and to cloud-based networks for service providers and enterprise customers worldwide, with a broader and deeper sales footprint, increased ability to invest in growth, more efficient and effective research and development, and a comprehensive RTC product offering.
Industry Background
Traditional TDM-based voice and data solutions are being supplanted by alternative IP-based networks. Given this shift, today’s telecommunications service providers and enterprises are faced with two separate but related challenges: how to upgrade their aging and costly communications infrastructure, and how to implement new and innovative software, IP and cloud-based communications capabilities. Service providers in particular must address these challenges while at the same time responding to competition in the form of new web-scale communication providers such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.
To address these challenges, service providers and enterprises are modernizing their communications networks, network functions and communications applications from legacy environments to new environments using IP, NFV and the cloud to take advantage of the many benefits that these technologies offer with an end goal of providing better and more productive communications experiences to their customers and employees.
Telecommunications Service Providers: Network Modernization 
One of the most significant capital costs for telecommunications service providers has been and continues to be their infrastructure. In order to leverage past capital investments and deliver existing and new services, service providers must consolidate their infrastructure from the costly, legacy infrastructures such as the PSTN and the PLMN into the more efficient and flexible IP- and software-based network models, which are capable of driving revenue growth. Migrating from the PSTN to IP reduces real estate, power and operating costs. IP networks allow the consolidation of voice, video and data within a single IP-based networking infrastructure over broadband and wireless access and enables new communications services, such as SIP Trunking and HUCs. Similarly, modernizing mobile networks to the IMS-based 4G LTE and VoLTE networks enables mobile service providers to offer better and more efficient mobile communications experiences to end users. As consumers and businesses continue to demand more engaging and productive communications experiences, we believe network modernization is and will continue to be essential to service providers’ ability to compete effectively in the market for telecommunications services.
Modernization of Networks to IP
Communication trends have been shifting for the past several years. What was once an industry built on voice communications from central office switches and PBXs on the enterprise premise is now being replaced by the use of social networks, OTT service providers, mobile applications, and hosted service providers. Consumers are increasingly turning to OTT applications 
7

(like WhatsApp, Apple’s Facetime, Messaging or Amazon’s Alexa). This shift has created an enhanced experience for consumers and has heightened expectations for future products and services.
Businesses, large and small, are re-architecting business processes and undergoing a digital transformation, building their own virtualized solutions in the cloud or moving their IT applications entirely to public cloud applications, and adding RTC and collaboration to their customer service solutions. These new solutions improve customer service and create an e-commerce experience that blends online applications with the in-store environment, creating a seamless experience for customers. Network modernization to IP-based systems enables service providers to add modern communications service offers that blend traditional voice messaging capabilities with contemporary features such as video messaging, visual voicemail, mobile messaging and email integration, and an accelerated time-to-market for differentiated messaging services. 
Secure Real-time Communications
For most telecommunications service providers, the move to IP-based RTC presumes a strategic, phased migration. This evolution exposes service providers to new security threats, as the “walled” protection offered by their voice network infrastructures no longer exists with SIP and data-based networks. With SIP-based systems, RTC applications such as voice, video and messaging become data applications, and without appropriate security measures in place, these networks are left open to security breaches and hacks. Additionally, the move to SIP has seen an increase in fraud in service provider networks in the form of robo-dialing and toll fraud schemes.
Given these threats, there is a need for sophisticated security solutions to protect networks during the network transformation process. Service providers have relied on SBCs, which are deployed within networks that are designed to provide robust security, as well as simplify interoperability, routing and other functions as a protection measure. By their nature, SBCs are application-aware and therefore can use data and sophisticated analytics to detect and thwart security breaches. We believe securing networks against threats is most effective when secure software solutions are deployed within networks and integrated into existing RTC investments.
Network Function Virtualization
In addition to shifting from legacy to secure IP networks, service providers are increasingly moving toward NFV in order to be able to offer new services quickly to their customers, reduce costs and compete with Web-Scale companies. NFV offers a new way to design, deploy and manage networking services by decoupling network functions from proprietary hardware appliances so they can run in software. This transformation enables better use of network infrastructure, creates agility, delivers rapid and elastic scaling, and enables faster time to market. VNFs can be deployed on generic computing platforms, hosted in private and public clouds, located in data centers, or within other network elements, and on end user premises.
Cloud and “as a Service” Models
As communications applications are deployed in the cloud, service providers gain the ability to offer a new class of business models commonly referred to “as a Service” solutions. These solutions include:
CPaaS: CPaaS is a cloud-based platform that enables developers to add RTC features such as voice, data, video, and messaging in their own applications without needing to build backend infrastructure and interfaces. CPaaS provides software developers the flexibility to “drag and drop” these features into their native applications or within web sites, through simple APIs and SDKs. With CPaaS, enterprises can quickly build applications that tie RTC and their social channels to their business workflows. This technology has not only moved real time communications off carrier networks, but also has greatly simplified the development and deployment of RTC capabilities.
UCaaS: Deploying UC within the “cloud” helps businesses provide flexibility and scalability for core business tasks. UCaaS features include enterprise messaging, presence technology, online meetings, team collaboration, telephony and video conferencing in lieu of traditional voice solutions, such as PBXs or carrier based Centrex. With CPaaS, enterprises can quickly build applications that tie RTC and their social channels to their business workflows.
STaaS: SIP trunking enables service providers to bundle voice and data over a single converged IP pipe and brings connectivity to the enterprise, creating a more economical offering than can be achieved with separate voice and data connections. STaaS delivers IP telephone to customers equipped with IP-PBX and UC facilities. With STaaS, customers have the flexibility to turn up or down and manage their own SIP trunks without the need for additional hardware on-premises or in the network.

Enterprises: Network Modernization and Digital Transformation
Today’s businesses, both enterprises and SMBs, are undergoing not only a network modernization but also a digital business transformation. The focus is shifting from person-to-person communications to contextual collaboration and omni-channel customer experiences. Within this context, businesses need a secure, scalable and innovative alternative to proprietary PBX and UC products. As part of their digital transformation, businesses have adopted the cloud, open interfaces, mobile, Big Data, and analytics. Seeing the advantages and cost savings from the cloud, businesses are migrating their communications solutions to this same environment, thereby enabling connections between business processes, communications, and collaboration.
Network Modernization
Enterprises undergoing network modernization are focused on moving from TDM-based PBXs to SIP trunking and new UC and collaboration systems while ensuring interoperability during the transformation process. In addition, enterprises in certain industries will often be subject to specific requirements or standards before a network transformation is completed. For example, governments may require JITC certification for secure deployments, and healthcare providers may need to achieve HIPAA certification. 
When modernizing a network, the ability to interwork modern applications such as Microsoft’s Skype for Business, with legacy analog endpoints on premises, becomes essential. SBCs play an integral role in providing interworking and survivability options. As discussed above, SBCs play a crucial role in securing the network modernization process, which is a top priority for any business. 
Digital Transformation
Successful enterprises today are focused on innovating their core product offerings and building a strategic advantage to reach and empower their customers. As technologies evolve and new mobile applications and connected devices proliferate, enterprises must adapt and innovate their communications solutions to create a “connected” experience anywhere, anytime, on any device. As part of this process, businesses are increasingly deploying “as a Service” offerings from the cloud (from either a service provider or a web-scale provider). UCaaS and CPaaS create a single communications platform that changes the way enterprises interact with customers and meet their expectations. CPaaS enables enterprises to quickly build applications that tie real time communications and their social channels to their business processes while UCaaS delivers the underlying UC infrastructure to ensure end users have the features and functionality required to enable reliable and scalable end-to-end communications.

Our Strategy
Ribbon is a leader in enabling network modernization and we plan to continue to invest in our platform approach to increase our global reach and scale. Ribbon is intently focused on realizing the cost synergies and product rationalizations that it aimed to achieve through the Merger. Key elements of Ribbon’s strategy include:
Continue to Enable our Service Provider and Enterprise Customers to Transform their Networks and Business Models. Changing consumption patterns of end customers and consumers of secure real-time communications, combined with competitive pressures, are forcing service providers and enterprises to significantly expand their RTC environments to provide better, more agile end customer experiences containing operational and capital expenditure costs. This in turn is requiring them to transform their networks and business models for secure RTC. The Ribbon portfolio enables this transformation.
Focus on our Customer Needs. Our customers are key to the success of our business and our business model is focused on aligning with our customers through direct engagement, service and support as well as through our channel partners. This model allows us to target our sales and research and development efforts based on the needs of our customers and we believe it is critical to our success.
Build on Growing our Customer Footprint and Global Reach. Ribbon has over 1,000 customers globally, in all of the major regions of the world, including some of the largest telecommunications service providers and enterprises in the world. This footprint allows us to sell additional products and services from the Ribbon portfolio to that deployed base of existing customers and provides us the ability to sell new products and services to that customer base. We also continue to look for opportunities to expand our portfolio footprint and global reach to further diversify our customer base.
Selectively Invest in our Core Products and Solutions. In order to service our customers that have deployed our products and solutions and support their key priorities and growth, we must strategically invest in research and development. We are committed to balancing our research and development investments between existing products and solutions and new growth-oriented product initiatives. In addition, we are focused on investing in products and solutions that we will be profitable for our Company. We intend to sunset certain less significant product offerings that are not aligned with our strategic direction and are not meaningful contributors to profitability. We believe this will allow us to more effectively and efficiently deploy capital to growth areas. Through targeted research and development investments in core products and solutions that will align with our strategy for growth, we are committed to helping our customers migrate their networks to software, and virtualized and cloud environments.

Disciplined Expansion into New Markets and Applications for Growth. We believe that a disciplined approach to targeting new markets and applications is critical to growing our business. As such, we have taken actions to expand our portfolio and offers to our customers. Two key growth initiatives include a focus on cloud communications and RTC security. We have also begun to work with our customers on the deployment of our Kandy platform to offer new and innovative RTC services. Similarly, given our significant experience with securing IP network borders with our SBC portfolio, and the increasing importance of security in today’s networks and communications, we are working on expanding our role in securing RTC with new portfolio offerings.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Relationships, Alliances and Acquisitions. Ribbon continues to pursue strategic relationships, alliances and acquisitions that align our business with our customers’ strategic goals and objectives as well as our own strategic goals for further extending our footprint, reach, scale and growth in the business.
Competitive Differentiation
In addition to our scale and global presence, there are several factors that set us apart and allow us to compete effectively with comparable peers in terms of scope, size and scale. 
Installed Base. Ribbon has a large deployed based of Nortel softswitches and media gateways in global service provider and enterprise networks supporting over 30 million legacy switched access lines. These softswitches are highly integrated into our customer’s back office environments and require specialized tools and intellectual property from Ribbon to consolidate and migrate those environments to newer IP based services with optimal capital expenditure investments. Similarly, our large deployed based of SBCs at service providers and enterprises offers Ribbon a unique platform for upgrading and cross-selling products into that installed base.
Strong Technology in Virtualization. Ribbon has extensive network virtualization software products and technology as part of our overall portfolio and have begun deploying these products to help our customers in the modernization of their networks to software-based virtualization and the cloud. A significant portion of our overall portfolio has software and virtualized offerings that can co-exist with our hardware appliance based options.
Security Experience and Technology. Our SBC technology, deployments and expertise are market leading. Ribbon has been securing service provider and enterprise networks and RTC sessions for over nine years, giving us a strong platform from which to launch additional security offers into the market. We believe our SBC products are unmatched in the market on reliability, performance and functionality at scale.
Media Processing, Transcoding and Signaling Technology Expertise. We have extensive experience in deploying mobile VoLTE and VoWifi solutions. Our voice media transcoding technology that is supported by CPU, GPU or DSP options is industry leading. Our mobile network evolution solutions are deployed in large-scale 4G VoLTE networks supporting over 200 million subscribers in total.

We have incorporated third-party licensed technology into certain of our current products. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or to enhance existing products. Based on experience and standard industry practice, we believe that licenses to use third-party technology generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that necessary third-party licenses will be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, the inability to maintain, license or re-license any third-party licenses required in our current products, or to obtain any new third-party licenses to develop new products and enhance existing products could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost. This could delay or prevent us from making these products or enhancements, any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
Please see generally the risks that are more fully discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for risks related to our intellectual property.
Our Customers
We have over 1,000 customers globally. Our customers are located around the world in over 50 countries and include many of the leading global telecommunications service providers and enterprises. Service providers use our products to provide secure RTC for the service providers (in the case of interconnects), enterprises and consumers they serve. Enterprises use our products to provide RTC for their employees (including remote workers) as well as provide secure communications networks for their customer-facing components, such as contact centers.
13

Our global service provider customers include fixed-line, mobile, cable, internet and interconnect service providers. Our Enterprise customers include businesses of all sizes, ranging from SOHO, SMB and large enterprises across various industry verticals with a concentration in the federal government, healthcare and education sectors. We sell to customers via a direct sales team as well as through indirect channels that include VARs, system integrators and service providers. Independent software vendors also partner with Ribbon to source our communications solutions and market them through their sales channels.
In the year ended December 31, 2017, 17% of our revenues were derived from sales to one customer, Verizon Networks, a service provider that provides interconnect, fixed line and mobile communications services. Verizon is transforming its TDM network from a hardware centric network to a SIP and NFV based network, and Ribbon is playing a key role in this transformation. Our top five customers represented approximately 41% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017.
Competitive Conditions
Competition in the telecommunications market is intense. The market is shifting from a market dominated by a few large incumbent telecommunications equipment companies, such as Ericsson LM Telephone Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and Nokia Corporation (which recently merged with Alcatel-Lucent S.A.), to a market that is characterized by network virtualization, migration to the cloud, and open interfaces. We believe this shift creates opportunities for us, as well as our direct competitors in telecommunications and networking, which include:
Within the network transformation space: mid-size vendors of networking and telecommunications equipment and specialty vendors, including AudioCodes Ltd., Dialogic Inc., Mavenir Systems, Inc., Metaswitch Networks Corporation, Oracle Communications and ADTRAN, Inc.; and
Within the enterprise and cloud solutions space: Microsoft, 8x8, Inc., Avaya Inc., Bandwidth Inc., Cisco Inc., (with Tropo Inc./Broadsoft, Inc.), F5 Networks, Inc., Mitel Networks Corporation (with ShoreTel, Inc.), Plivo Inc., RingCentral, Inc., Tokbox Inc., Twilio Inc. and Vonage Holdings Corp. (with Nexmo, Inc.).
Other smaller private and public companies are also focusing on similar market opportunities. Mergers among any of the above companies or other competitors, as well as additional competitors with significant financial resources entering our markets, could further intensify competition. Mergers between service providers may also increase competition, as these reduce the number of customers and channels for products and solutions. 
To compete effectively, we must deliver innovative products that provide extremely high reliability and quality; deploy and scale easily and efficiently; interoperate with existing network infrastructures and multivendor solutions; provide effective network management; are accompanied by comprehensive customer support and professional services; provide a cost-effective and space-efficient solution for enterprises and service providers; meet price competition from low cost equipment providers; and offer solutions that are timely for the market and support where the industry is heading.
Although we believe we compete favorably because our solutions are widely deployed, highly scalable and cost-effective for our customers, some of our competitors have broader product portfolios than we have and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, some of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have, including relationships with our potential customers and established relationships with distribution partners.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products, solutions and services to our customers with a direct internal sales force and also indirectly via channels and partnerships globally, leveraging the assistance of VARs such as Verizon Communications Inc. and distributors such as Westcon Group Inc, BlackBox and Arrow S3. Our channel partner programs are designed to serve particular markets and provide our customers with opportunities to purchase our products in combination with related services and products. For example, Ribbon is a Microsoft Gold Communications Partner and helps enterprises optimize Skype for Business (and Teams) deployments by securing those communications.
As a primary supplier of network infrastructure solutions to Tier 1 service providers (a service provider that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit), we require a strong worldwide presence. We have an established sales presence throughout North America, Europe, Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Central/South America. We also have a dedicated direct sales team focused on the Federal Government sector in the United States. 
14

Our marketing team is focused on promoting company brand awareness, increasing our solutions, product, technology and services differentiation and awareness via webinars, company web sites, advertising and digital outreach, as well as generating qualified sales leads. We promote thought leadership on technology and our solutions within the industry by participating in and speaking at industry events and conferences and via social network campaigns and blogs. Our marketing team also provides briefings to industry analysts on a regular basis and at major industry events, communicates with the media in connection with noteworthy public announcements and supports our investor relations department on quarterly conference calls and regular investor updates.
Manufacturing
Our contract manufacturers provide comprehensive manufacturing services, including assembly and testing of our hardware products and procurement of component materials on our behalf. We believe that outsourcing the manufacturing of our hardware products enables us to preserve working capital, allows for greater flexibility in meeting changes in demand and enables us to be more responsive in delivering diverse product offerings to our customers. As of December 31, 2017, we outsourced the manufacturing of our hardware products to four manufacturers, two of which we primarily rely upon. We and our contract manufacturers purchase several key components of our hardware products, including commercial digital signal processors, from single or limited sources. We purchase these components on a purchase order basis.
Please see generally the risks that are more fully discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for risks related to our manufacturing operations and use of contract manufacturers.
Research and Development
We believe that strong product development capabilities are essential to our strategy of enhancing our core technology, developing additional security and network modernization features and maintaining comprehensive product and service offerings. Our research and development process leverages innovative technology in response to market data and customer feedback. As part of this process, we regularly review research and development investments in our products and balance them against market demand.
We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers with significant transcoding, UC application and networking industry experience. Our engineers have deep experience in and with leading wireline and wireless telecommunications equipment suppliers, computer data networking and multimedia companies. Our engineering effort is focused on UC, NFV and security product development. We also continue to invest in Kandy.
As of December 31, 2017, we maintained research and development offices in Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Texas, New York, New Jersey and North Carolina, United States; Kanata, Montreal and Ontario, Canada; Bangalore, India and Swindon, United Kingdom.
We have made, and intend to continue to make, a substantial investment in research and development. Our research and development expenses were $101.5 million for the year ended December 2017, $72.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to the inclusion of GENBAND’s research and development expenses from October 27, 2017 to December 31, 2017 in our consolidated results of operations for 2017.
Seasonality
We have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience increases in order volume in the fourth quarter due to greater spending on operating and capital expenditures by our service provider customers. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the beginning of the calendar year, when our service provider customers are finalizing their annual budgets, which may result in lower revenues in the first quarter. These seasonal effects may vary and do not always correlate to our operating results. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future operating results.
Backlog
We sell products and services pursuant to purchase orders issued under master agreements that provide standard terms and conditions that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale. These agreements typically do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed quantities, nor do they generally require upfront cash deposits. At any given time, we have orders for products that have not yet been shipped and for services (including our customer support obligations) 
15

that have not yet been performed. We also have orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed but have not yet been accepted by the customer under the applicable purchase terms. We include both of these situations in our calculation of backlog. A backlogged order may not result in revenue in the quarter in which it was booked, and the actual revenue recognized in a quarter may not equal the total amount of related backlog. In addition, although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any future period. In addition, we expect to derive a greater percentage of our revenue in the future from the enterprise market and through sales channels where speed of fulfillment is essential to winning business. Consequently, we expect to derive a lower percentage of our business from large service provider orders that are delivered over multiple quarters and years and we expect our backlog to decrease as a result. Our backlog was approximately $400 million at December 31, 2017 and approximately $123 million at December 31, 2016. 
Our Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had a total of 2,457 employees, comprised of 1,605 employees located in the Americas, 310 employees located in the Middle East, Africa and Europe and 542 employees located in the Asia Pacific region. Certain of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements, primarily in Europe. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
Geographic and Segment Information
We operate in a single segment. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. To date, our chief operating decision maker has made such decisions and assessed performance at the company level, as one segment. Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief Executive Officer.
Our classification of revenue by geographic area is determined by the ship-to location of our customers. The following table summarizes revenue by geographic area as a percentage of total revenue:

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
United States | 66 | % | | 69 | % | 71 | %
Europe, Middle East and Africa | 14 | | | 13 | | 13 | 
Japan | 7 | | | 10 | | 10 | 
Other Asia Pacific | 7 | | | 5 | | 4 |
