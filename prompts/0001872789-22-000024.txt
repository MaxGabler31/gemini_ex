Item 1. Business.
General
Embecta Corp. (also referred to herein as "Embecta") was formed through a spin-off of the diabetes care business (the "Separation") from Becton, Dickinson and Company ("BD"). All references in this Form 10-K to "Embecta", "the Company", "we", "our" or "us" refer to Embecta Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated by the context. On April 1, 2022 (the "Separation Date"), Embecta and BD entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"). Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, BD agreed to spin off its diabetes care business ("Diabetes Care Business") into Embecta, a new, publicly traded company.
We are a leading global medical device company focused on providing solutions to improve the health and well-being of people living with diabetes. In our close to 100-year history of our business, we believe that our products have become one of the most widely recognized and respected brands in diabetes management in the world. We estimate that our products are used by nearly 30 million people in over 100 countries for insulin administration and to aid with the daily management of diabetes.
We have a broad portfolio of marketed products, including a variety of pen needles, syringes and safety injection devices, which are complemented by our proprietary digital application designed to assist people with managing their diabetes. Our pen needles are sterile, single-use, medical devices, designed to be used in conjunction with pen injectors that inject insulin or other diabetes medications. We also sell safety pen needles, which have shields on both ends of the cannula that automatically deploy after the injection to help prevent needlestick exposure and injury during injection and disposal. Our traditional and safety pen needles are compatible and frequently used with widely available pen injectors in the market today. In addition to pen needles, we sell sterile, single-use insulin syringes, which are used to inject insulin drawn from insulin vials. We also sell safety insulin syringes, which have a sliding safety arm that can be activated with one-hand after the injection to help prevent needlestick exposure and injury during injection and disposal.
In addition to selling pen needles, syringes and safety devices, we seek to promote advances in diabetes care through thought leadership, and engagement with the diabetes community, healthcare providers and other stakeholders. To foster connection with and offer support to people with diabetes, we launched our diabetes care app in 2018, which has been downloaded more than 550,000 times. The diabetes care app serves as a channel for our support, education of and engagement with the diabetes community. In addition, we intend to explore strategic collaborative partnerships and acquisition opportunities that enable us to accelerate our growth. We intend to selectively pursue strategic collaborative opportunities that give us access to innovative technologies, complementary product lines, and new markets.
Global Operations
Our global manufacturing, commercial team and distribution networks enable us to produce and distribute our products to end users and healthcare providers in over 100 countries. We have three manufacturing sites located in Ireland, the United States and China. We believe that these manufacturing sites enable us to efficiently and consistently produce high-quality, safe and reliable products. We distribute our products through a variety of channels, including retail, hospitals, pharmacies and other institutional channels. Our commercial team and distribution networks enable us to reach a broad base of customers across the globe.
Raw Materials and Components
We use a broad range of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. We purchase all our raw materials and certain components from third-party suppliers. The primary materials that comprise our pen needles and insulin syringes are cannula, plastic resin, adhesive, needle lubricants, rubber stoppers and packaging material. We purchase some of these and other materials from a single or limited number of sources for various reasons, including quality assurance, cost-effectiveness, and continuity of supply, among others.
In connection with the Separation, we entered into a cannula supply agreement with BD, whereby BD sells to us cannulas for incorporation into our pen needles and syringes. Subsequent to the Separation, BD retained ownership of all cannula production activities and the associated intellectual property rights of BD and its subsidiaries relating to cannula, the manufacture thereof and other critical cannula-related technology.
The design and formulation of certain materials and components is proprietary and the intellectual property rights may be owned exclusively by one party. In the case of sole sourced parts, we manage risk through holding inventory ourselves and at the supplier to ensure continuity of supply and lower the risk of disruption.
Research and Development
Our strategy seeks to update and develop enhanced technology for our portfolio of current and future products by focusing on patient unmet needs and market expansion. As we develop these products we intend to apply for clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and similar regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
For example, we are currently working on developing an insulin patch pump focused on serving the needs of people living with Type 2 diabetes. We anticipate this insulin patch pump will have an increased reservoir size to hold more insulin and a simplified user interface compared to existing insulin patch pumps, and overall provide for an improved user experience. 
Intellectual Property and Licenses
Intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In many cases, we own this intellectual property directly, but in other cases, we access technologies through a combination of license and supply arrangements.
While no single patent or patent family is material to our business, our pen needle and syringe products contain features that are protected by a portfolio of utility and design patents, including features related to safety, comfort and ease of use. In addition, potential features of our insulin patch pump technology and finer gauge pen needle currently under development and software we market to end users for managing diabetes are covered by a variety of patents and patent applications. Generally, patent protection for these products and technologies is sought in the United States, Canada, Europe, China and Japan. We are not aware of any pending third-party claims or challenges that would be expected to materially affect the patent protection of these products or technologies.
As of September 30, 2022, we held about 1,100 patents in the United States and in various foreign countries in which we conduct business, as well as about 280 patents pending. The majority of our U.S. and foreign patents for individual products are in force for twenty years from the initial filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
Our products and services are sold around the world under various trade names, trademarks and brand names, which we consider to be valuable in the marketing of our products in each segment. As of September 30, 2022, we had about 400 trademark registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries in which we conduct business, as well as about 220 trademark applications pending worldwide.
Embecta owns, and BD provides Embecta a license to use, intellectual property rights necessary to operate our business. BD grants Embecta a license to use such intellectual property rights on the terms and conditions set forth in an intellectual property matters agreement, which are described under “Agreements Related to the Separation.”
Competition
The diabetes care industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and innovation. Our products compete across a continuum of therapies and administration modalities designed to manage diabetes. We face competition and innovation from both new and existing companies pursuing new delivery devices, injection technologies, drugs, and therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes.
Companies with whom we currently compete in the diabetes drug injection business include Novo Nordisk, HTL-Strefa, Terumo Medical Corporation, and Ypsomed. We also compete with providers of insulin pumps and other insulin administration devices. We compete in the marketplace based on a number of factors, including product quality, clinical innovation, price, service and reputation.
Regulation
Changes in legislation or government policies, including with respect to licensing, health information privacy and data privacy and healthcare costs, reimbursement, coverage and access, can have a material impact on our worldwide operations. Our operations are subject to, and affected by, regulations of medical devices promulgated by federal, state and local authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and other regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. FDA regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance and approval, manufacturing, labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, postmarket surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products and record keeping. These regulations not only affect our existing markets products, but also our ability to market new products under development. For existing and potential new products, failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, which may include warning letters that require corrective action, fines, injunctions, rescissions of previously granted clearances and/or approvals and other penalties.
We maintain a robust FDA Quality System Regulation and ISO Quality Systems that establish standards for our product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes, inclusive of Current Good Manufacturing Practices. The FDA and other regulatory agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of our quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. As a medical device manufacturer and distributor, our manufacturing facilities and the facilities of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, certain corresponding state agencies, and other regulatory bodies. Prior to marketing or selling most of our products, we must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart non-United States regulatory agencies. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in agency policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new and existing products. Where possible, we anticipate these factors in product development and planning processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions. 
International sales of our products are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign regulatory authority may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly, particularly outside of the European Union, Canada and other industrialized countries. In addition, other jurisdictions continue to update requirements for marketing and sale of products in their geography, often becoming more stringent. As we operate in other regions and continue to expand into emerging markets, new requirements may require updates to our quality management system. These global changes are monitored and reviewed as part of the overall quality lifecycle.

Agreements Related to the Separation
In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement, which contains provisions that, among other things, relate to (i) assets, liabilities and contracts to be transferred, assumed and assigned to each of Embecta and BD (including certain deferred assets and liabilities) as part of the Separation, (ii) cross-indemnities principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Embecta's business with Embecta and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of BD’s remaining businesses with BD, (iii) procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters, (iv) the allocation among Embecta and BD of rights and obligations under existing insurance policies with respect to occurrences prior to completion of the Separation, as well as the right to proceeds and the obligation to incur certain deductibles under certain insurance policies, and (v) procedures governing Embecta’s and BD’s obligations and allocations of liabilities with respect to ongoing litigation matters that may implicate each of BD’s business and Embecta’s business. 
Agreements that Embecta entered into with BD that govern aspects of Embecta's relationship with BD following the Separation include, but are not limited to:
•Transition Services Agreements ("TSA") - Pursuant to the TSA, Embecta and BD and their respective affiliates provide each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, information technology, procurement, quality and regulatory affairs, medical affairs, tax and treasury services. The agreed-upon charges for such services are generally intended to allow the servicing party to charge a price comprised of out-of-pocket costs and expenses and a predetermined profit in the form of a mark-up of such out-of-pocket costs and expenses. The services will terminate no later than 24 months following the Separation. The service recipient may terminate any services by giving prior written notice to the provider of such services and paying any applicable wind-down charges.
•Distribution Agreements - Embecta and BD entered into distribution agreements for certain territories, principally in the Asia Pacific Region and Latin America, whereby a subsidiary of BD has been appointed as a distributor of Embecta or its relevant subsidiaries to support certain commercial operations of the diabetes care business on a transitional basis in these regions for a maximum of two years. The distribution agreements will each continue until either (1) certain governmental approvals needed to distribute products in the defined territory are obtained and order-to-cash processes and other services of the Company for such territory are migrated to an alternative commercial arrangement between the parties or (2) the applicable services are transitioned to a third-party distributor or independently performed by Embecta, but in any event no longer than the maximum term of two years. Embecta shall pay BD a return of 1.5% to 2.0% of net revenue for each territory. 
•Cannula Supply Agreement - Embecta and BD entered into a cannula supply agreement whereby BD sells to Embecta cannulas for incorporation into Embecta's existing syringes and pen needles, safety syringes and safety pen needles, and insulin patch pump, pen needles and safety pen needle currently under development. BD retains ownership of all cannula technology, cannula production activities and the intellectual property rights therein. Embecta is limited to a maximum number of cannulas that it can purchase under the cannula supply agreement, which will be an absolute upper limit of cannulas per year and yearly limits that vary with annual demand. The cannula supply agreement is terminable by Embecta without cause by providing at least 36 months’ written notice; however, such termination can be effective no earlier than five years from the Separation. The cannula supply 
agreement will be terminable by BD without cause by providing at least 36 months’ written notice; however, such termination can be effective no earlier than ten years from the Separation. However, in the event of a change of control of Embecta, BD has the right to terminate the cannula supply agreement in its sole discretion. The cannula supply agreement will also terminate automatically, subject to a 36-month wind-down period, if Embecta’s yearly forecast is below the required minimum purchase amount, and the parties have other customary termination rights for material breach or bankruptcy of the other party.
•Tax Matters Agreement - Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Embecta agreed to certain covenants that contain restrictions intended to preserve the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions. Embecta may take certain actions prohibited by these covenants only if Embecta obtains and provides to BD an opinion from a United States tax counsel or accountant of recognized national standing, in either case satisfactory to BD, to the effect that such action would not jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions, or if Embecta obtains prior written consent of BD. Embecta is barred from taking any action, or failing to take any action, where such action or failure to act adversely affects or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions or result in certain other taxes to BD, for all relevant time periods. In addition, during the period ending two years after the Separation, these covenants include specific restrictions on Embecta’s (i) discontinuing the active conduct of Embecta’s trade or business; (ii) issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into Embecta stock, but excluding certain compensatory arrangements); (iii) liquidating, merging, or consolidating with any other person; (iv) amending Embecta’s certificate of incorporation (or other organizational documents) or taking any other action, whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise, affecting the voting rights of Embecta common stock; (v) sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business; and (vi) entering into any other corporate transaction which would cause Embecta to undergo a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership.
•Logistics Services Agreement - Embecta and BD entered into a logistics services agreement whereby BD provides Embecta with certain order-to-cash and logistics services to support certain commercial operations for a maximum term of two years. Embecta will pay BD (i) reimbursable costs, including all shipping costs, selling costs, general administration costs, costs of goods, research and development services costs, and other income and expenses related solely to the diabetes care business, that are incurred by BD directly, as allocated costs or as costs payable to a third party and (ii) a monthly administrative fee of 1.0% of net revenue.
•Other agreements that Embecta entered into with BD include, but are not limited to, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement, local support services agreements, certain other manufacturing arrangements and a process services agreement and lease agreement for a manufacturing facility location in Holdrege, Nebraska.

We believe that diversity of our teams makes us better at identifying opportunities and solving problems. We are committed to creating and sustaining an environment where everyone brings their authentic selves to work, to help us fulfil our mission of helping people with diabetes.
Corporate Responsibility ("CR") and ESG
As part of the Separation from BD, Embecta is in process of developing a standalone multi-year strategy to advance its ESG initiatives. The focus in fiscal year 2022 was primarily evaluation, as Embecta’s risks and impacts are different to those of BD. This evaluation phase commenced with a Sustainability Materiality Assessment and an internal review of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Separately, the governance structures for managing ESG topics and updates were documented via the Company's Enterprise Risk Committee charter. Embecta plans to publish its inaugural Sustainability Report in mid fiscal year 2023.
