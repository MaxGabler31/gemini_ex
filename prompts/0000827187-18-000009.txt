ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Sleep Number Corporation (formerly Select Comfort Corporation), based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was founded in 1987. In 1998, Sleep Number became a publicly traded company. We are listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ Global Select Market) under the symbol “SNBR.” When used herein, the terms “Sleep Number,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Sleep Number Corporation, including consolidated subsidiaries.
Our mission is to improve lives by individualizing sleep experiences. Our vision is to become one of the world's most beloved brands by delivering an unparalleled sleep experience. We expect to achieve our goals by executing our consumer innovation strategy with three significant competitive advantages: proprietary sleep innovations, lifelong customer relationships and exclusive retail distribution. 
As the leader in sleep innovation, Sleep Number delivers the best quality sleep through effortless, adjustable comfort and biometric sleep tracking. We are a visionary in health and wellness, proving the connection between sleep and well-being. We have a vertically integrated business model and are the exclusive designer, manufacturer, marketer, retailer and servicer of Sleep Number beds. We offer consumers high-quality, individualized sleep solutions and services, including a complete line of Sleep Number beds, bases and bedding accessories. We are the pioneer in biometric sleep tracking and adjustability. Only the Sleep Number bed offers SleepIQ technology - a proprietary sensor technology that tracks each individual’s sleep and works directly with the bed’s DualAir system to automatically adjust the comfort level of each sleeper. With the SleepIQ technology platform, we are powering one of the most comprehensive databases of biometric sleep data in the world, and fundamentally changing the way we monitor and manage health. Through daily digital interactions that build lifelong relationships, SleepIQ technology also communicates how you slept and provides insights on what adjustments you can make to optimize your sleep and improve your daily life. Sleep Number also offers FlextFit adjustable bases, Sleep Number pillows, sheets and other bedding products. As a direct-to-consumer brand, we offer consumers a cohesive experience across our Sleep Number stores, online at SleepNumber.com or via phone at (800) 753-3768.
We are committed to delivering superior shareholder value through three primary drivers of earnings per share growth: increasing consumer demand, leveraging our business model and deploying capital efficiently. Since 2012, we have transformed the business with $487 million of capital expenditures and acquisitions. This effort has strengthened our competitive advantages and positioned us for accelerated profits and cash generation. In 2017, we increased net sales by 10% to $1.4 billion and increased operating income by 20% to $92 million.

In September 2015, we completed the acquisition of BAM Labs, Inc. (now operating as SleepIQ LABS), the leading provider of biometric sensor and sleep monitoring technology for data-driven health and wellness. The addition of SleepIQ LABS strengthens Sleep Number’s leadership in sleep innovation, adjustability and individualization. The acquisition broadens and deepens electrical, biomedical, software and backend capabilities - API (application program interface) and bio-signal analysis. Our ownership and control of biometric data advances smart, connected products that empower our customers to experience quality sleep.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we replaced our nearly 20-year-old legacy computer systems with a new vertically integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The new operating platform enables operational efficiencies, improves customer convenience and supports the growth of our business.
Proprietary Sleep Innovations

The Sleep Number 360® Smart Bed 
 
In January 2017 at CES (the world’s preeminent technology showcase and innovation catalyst), Sleep Number introduced the Sleep Number 360 smart bed line, the most significant innovation in our 30-year history. The Sleep Number 360 smart bed won 13 awards at CES, including being named the Best of Innovation Honoree in the Home Appliances category. Powered by SleepIQ technology, the Sleep Number 360 smart beds intuitively sense and automatically adjust comfort to keep both partners sleeping soundly all night. The SleepIQ technology platform integrates hardware, software and design to deliver effortless adjustability, sleep tracking and connectivity.

The Sleep Number 360 smart mattresses and FlexFit smart adjustable bases will include these features that deliver improved quality sleep:


• | Self-adjusting comfort throughout the night. As sleep positions change during the night, Responsive Air technology adjusts the bed’s comfort via the two air chambers inside the mattress.


• | Foot-warming feature to fall asleep faster. It’s clinically proven that people fall asleep faster when their feet are warmed. SleepIQ technology knows the sleepers’ bedtime routines and warms the foot of the bed before bedtime with Rapid Sleep Onset technology.


• | Partner Snore adjustment. At the touch of a button, the 360 Smart Bed will elevate your partner’s head, which may relieve mild common snoring.


As of December 30, 2017, we have deployed three smart bed models: the p6, i7 and i10 Sleep Number 360 smart beds. The remainder of the 360 smart bed line will also be deployed in phases and we expect to have the core line transitioned by mid-year 2018.

Sleep Number® Bed Offerings

Unlike the “one-size-fits-all” solution offered by other mattress brands, the Sleep Number bed offers individualized comfort that is adjustable on each side of the bed. Our proprietary DualAir technology, which features two independent air chambers, allows couples to adjust firmness to their own individual preference at the touch of a button. Sleepers can each enjoy their ideal firmness, support and pressure-relieving comfort - their Sleep Number setting - for deep, restful sleep.
The benefits of our proprietary Sleep Number bed have been validated through clinical sleep research, which has shown that participants who slept on a Sleep Number bed generally fell asleep faster, experienced more deep sleep with fewer disturbances and experienced greater relief from back pain than those sleeping on a traditional innerspring mattress.
We offer Sleep Number beds in good, better and best price ranges within the premium mattress category, and in a broad range of sizes, including twin, full, queen, eastern king and California king.

• | The Classic Series offers Sleep Number adjustability starting at $899 for a queen mattress. The series includes the Sleep Number c2 and c4 beds.


• | The Performance Series includes our most popular mattresses with a perfect balance of softness and pressure-relieving support. The series includes the Sleep Number p5 bed and Sleep Number 360 p6 smart bed.


• | The Innovation Series is the ultimate in individualized comfort and temperature-balancing innovation, including the Sleep Number i8 bed, the Sleep Number 360 i7 smart bed and the 360 i10 smart bed.

Our commitment to quality, value, and service has been recognized by customers through J.D. Power. The J.D. Power's survey measures customer satisfaction with mattress purchases based on seven factors: comfort, price, support, durability, warranty, features 
3

and customer service. Sleep Number was ranked highest in customer satisfaction with mattresses in 2016 and 2017, and second highest in 2018.
SleepIQ® Technology
SleepIQ technology is a touchless, biometric sensor technology that tracks sleep during the night. Launched by Sleep Number in 2014, SleepIQ technology tracks the user's sleep by gathering hundreds of biometric readings per second continuously (heart rate, motion and breathing). The accuracy of SleepIQ technology heart rate, breath rate and movement measurements has been validated through in-home trials and sleep center studies. Based on this data, a proprietary algorithm delivers a personal SleepIQ score, from 1 to 100, to consumers each morning. SleepIQ also connects with leading health, fitness and sleep environment apps - including Apple® Health, FitBit®, Nest Learning Thermostat™, MapMyRun™ and Nokia Health Mate™ - to show a holistic view of how lifestyle choices may affect sleep.
The Sleep Number bed is the only bed that lets you track and optimize your sleep with SleepIQ technology. It empowers the sleeper to achieve their best possible sleep each night. In addition, SleepIQ can be added to Sleep Number beds purchased after 2008.
FlexFit™ Adjustable Base Technology
We offer a full line of exclusive FlexFit adjustable bases that enable customers to raise the head or foot of the bed, and to experience the comfort of massage. Our Partner Snore technology lets a user gently raise their partner’s head to relieve mild common snoring.
In conjunction with the 360 smart beds, we introduced a new line of FlexFit smart adjustable bases in 2017. This new series integrates with SleepIQ technology to deliver the new features and functionality previously described, and will replace our existing FlexFit base models.
Additional Sleep Number Innovations
Our exclusive Sleep Number bedding collection comprises a full line of sleep products that are designed to solve sleep issues. Sleep Number has a wide assortment of pillows designed to fit each individual's size, shape and sleeping position for more comfortable sleep. Our innovative bedding features make it easier to make your bed: our SmartFit design keeps sheets securely in place and Logic Label takes the guesswork out of making your bed. We also offer a wide assortment of temperature-balancing products including a DualTemp layer. This proprietary sleep innovation features active air technology that allows each person to select his or her ideal temperature at the simple touch of a button and can be used with any mattress brand or adjustable base.
The SleepIQ Kids bed extends Sleep Number's core DualAir adjustability and SleepIQ technology to the children's mattress market via two models, the k1 and the k2. It is the only bed that adjusts with children as they grow.
Exclusive Distribution

With the importance of building a brand relationship directly with consumers, nearly 99% of our net sales are direct to consumers through a cohesive experience across our Sleep Number stores, online at SleepNumber.com or via phone.

Since 2012, we have rebuilt our store portfolio and expanded our national footprint. This strategy has included repositioning a large percentage of our mall stores to stronger off-mall locations, improving the size and positioning within malls and adding stores in both existing and new trade areas. We are well positioned with a healthy retail store portfolio that is highly productive. As of year-end 2017, approximately 49% of our stores are less than five years old.
We target high-quality, convenient and visible store locations based on several factors, including each market’s overall sales potential, store geographic location, demographics and proximity to other specialty retail stores. As the exclusive distributor of Sleep Number products, we target one store per 350,000 - 500,000 people. This places our stores within an average radius of 10 miles, or 20-minute drive times, for most of our target customers.
Our award-winning store design and improved real estate locations support our value-added retail experience, which results in high store productivity and profitability. Our stores deliver nearly $1,000 of annual net sales per square foot and we average approximately $667,000 in annual net sales per full-time retail employee. Since 2012, we have increased our average store size by more than 58% to 2,647 square feet.
As of December 30, 2017, we had 556 retail stores in all 50 U.S. states, including new stores opened in Alaska and Hawaii, 57% of which were in non-mall locations. We have targeted up to 650 stores by 2019.

Working in conjunction with our retail stores, we have a cohesive online experience that helps customers easily engage in relevant content, research our products and solutions, transact online and find post-sales support. Our experience expands our digital brand connecting with consumers to drive deeper awareness, consideration and engagement.
We have adopted an agile development approach to our online initiatives. This means we deploy rapid experimentation and iterations of our digital experiences. Results include faster time-to-market of online improvements to drive store traffic and online conversion. Sleep Number products are available exclusively at SleepNumber.com or Sleep Number stores.
Our retail business accounted for 92% of our net sales in 2017. Average annual net sales per comparable store were $2.4 million in 2017. In 2017, 98% of our stores open for a full year generated net sales over $1 million and 61% of our stores open for a full year generated net sales over $2 million. We now have more than 20% of our store base delivering greater than $3 million in annual net sales. In 2017, our online and phone sales accounted for 7% of our net sales and wholesale accounted for 1% of our net sales.
Marketing
We use a broad set of marketing and advertising instruments to extend brand reach, deepen brand engagement, and motivate and educate customers for traffic to our brand. Our actions result in acquiring new customers and driving referral and repeat business. Our marketing efforts target a broad customer demographic: 30-54 years old with greater than $75,000 household income for our core line of products. Our customers care about their own and their family's sleep quality and know that it leads to better overall health and well-being.

Marketing drives growth in our business by building brand relevance, reputation, consumer awareness, consideration and ongoing engagement with our benefit-driven sleep innovations, which results in increased quality traffic to our website and stores. Our advertising communications utilize a mix of national and local marketing to target existing customers for referral and repeat purchases and to attract new customers. Television is our most efficient media, followed by digital and social media. We continue to build our in-house digital capabilities, content marketing, user experience and data-driven tools to make deeper connections with our customers, increase brand demand and improve media efficiency. In 2017, media expense represented 13.4% of net sales.
In early 2018, we entered into a multi-year partnership as the official sleep and wellness partner of the NFL aimed at amplifying our brand, our analytics and loyal customer-base. We will help players compete more effectively by measuring, understanding and maximizing the benefits of a great night's sleep. Sleep Number will work with players, teams and trainers as they integrate sleep insights into their overall performance regimens.
Operations

Manufacturing and Distribution
We have two manufacturing plants located in Irmo, South Carolina and Salt Lake City, Utah. The manufacturing operations in South Carolina and Utah consist of cutting and sewing of the fabric covers for our beds, and final assembly and packaging of mattresses and bases. In addition, our electrical Firmness Control systems are assembled in our Utah plant.
We obtain all the raw materials and components used to produce our beds from outside sources. A number of components, including our proprietary air chambers, our adjustable foundations, various components for our Firmness Control systems, as well as fabrics and zippers, are sourced from suppliers who currently serve as our sole or primary source of supply for these components. We believe we can obtain these raw materials and components from other sources of supply, although we could experience some short-term disruption in our ability to fulfill orders in the event of an unexpected loss of supply from one of our primary suppliers. We utilize dual sourcing on targeted components when effective.
We have taken, and continue to take, various measures to mitigate the potential impact of an unexpected disruption in supply from any sole-source suppliers, including increasing safety stocks and identifying potential secondary sources of supply. All the suppliers that produce unique or proprietary products for us have in place either contingency or disaster recovery plans or redundant production capabilities in other locations in order to safeguard against any unforeseen disasters. We review these plans and sites on a regular basis to ensure the suppliers' ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of materials and components.
Historically, we manufactured our bed components in our two plants and completed final bed assembly in customers’ homes. We are pursuing a multi-year evolution to enable delivery of assembled mattresses. In 2017, we opened two assembly distribution centers to assemble beds prior to delivery. We expect to expand this capability to approximately six assembly distribution centers over the next couple of years. We are also advancing our outbound logistics network to reduce product handling, hand-offs, damage and costs while 
5

in transit to customers’ homes. We see these initiatives providing a superior and reliable experience for customers with lower costs for the business.

Home Delivery Service

Nearly 85% of our beds sold are installed through our full-service home delivery team or by our third-party service providers in selected markets. The balance of beds are shipped directly to our customers and self-assembled. 
Customer Service

We have an in-house customer service team of specialists that provide service and support via phone, email, “live chat” and social media. Direct access to our customers is a unique advantage that also provides insights and identifies emerging trends as we strive to continuously improve our product and service quality and advance our product innovation.
Research and Development

As a consumer-driven innovation company, Sleep Number conducts extensive research to understand consumer needs. This research informs the design and delivery of our sleep innovations and our customer experience. We have a robust product development organization that fuels our innovations. In 2015, we acquired BAM Labs, Inc. (now operating as SleepIQ LABS), a leading provider of biometric sensor and sleep monitoring for data-driven health and wellness. This is significant as consumers are rapidly adopting new digital tools and using their personal data to improve health and wellness. Technology that improves the quality of sleep and overall wellness will continue to be a top priority for Sleep Number. Our research and development expenses were $28 million in 2017, $28 million in 2016 and $16 million in 2015.
Management Information Systems

We use information technology systems to operate, analyze and manage our business, to reduce operating costs and to enhance our customers' experience. Our major systems include an in-store order entry system, a retail portal system, a payment processing system, in-bound and out-bound telecommunications systems for direct marketing, delivery scheduling and customer service, e-commerce systems, a data warehouse system and an enterprise resource planning system. These systems are primarily comprised of packaged applications licensed from various software vendors plus a limited number of internally developed programs. Please refer to the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, for a discussion of certain risks that may be encountered in connection with our management information systems.
Intellectual Property

We hold various U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications regarding certain elements of the design and function of our products, including air control systems, remote control systems, air chamber features, mattress construction, foundation systems, sensing systems, as well as other technology. We have numerous U.S. patents, expiring at various dates between February 2019 and November 2035, and numerous U.S. patent applications pending. We also have numerous foreign patents and patent applications pending. Notwithstanding these patents and patent applications, we cannot ensure that these patent rights will provide substantial protection or that others will not be able to develop products that are similar to or competitive with our products.

We have a number of trademarks and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including Sleep Number®, SleepIQ®, Sleep Number 360®, SleepIQ Kids®, the Double Arrow logo, Select Comfort®, AirFit®, BAM Labs®, the “B” logo, Comfortaire®, ComfortFit®, Comfort.Individualized.®, Does Your Bed Do That?®, the DualTemp logo, the DualAir Technology Inside logo, FlexTop®, IndividualFit®, Individualized Sleep Experiences®, It®, Know Better Sleep®, Pillow[ology]®, PillowFit®, Probably the Best Bed in the World®, Sleep Number Inner Circle®, Tech-e®, Smart Bed For Smart Kids®, Smart Bed Technology®, The Only Bed That Grows With Them®, The Only Bed That Knows You®, Tonight Bedtime.

Industry and Competition
The U.S. bedding industry is a mature and generally stable industry. According to the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA), the industry has grown by approximately 5% annually over the last 20 years and at an estimated 6% annually, on average, over the past five years. We believe that industry unit growth has been primarily driven by population growth, an increase in the number of homes (including secondary residences) and the increased size of homes. We believe growth in average wholesale prices resulted from a shift to both larger and higher-quality beds, which are typically more expensive. According to ISPA, industry wholesale shipments of mattresses and foundations (excluding adjustable bases) were estimated to be $8.5 billion in 2017 compared to $8.4 billion in 2016. Furniture/Today, a furniture industry trade publication, has ranked Sleep Number as the 5th largest mattress manufacturer and 2nd largest U.S. bedding retailer for 2016, with a 7% market share of industry retail revenue.
The retail bedding industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Our Company-Controlled distribution channel is exclusive, and we compete against regional and local specialty bedding retailers, home furnishing stores, mass merchants, national discount stores and online marketers. Our consumer innovation strategy with exclusive distribution is highly differentiated, and results in retail-leading customer experience.
Manufacturers in the bedding industry compete on price, quality, brand name recognition, product availability and product performance, including the perceived levels of comfort and support provided by a mattress. There is a high degree of concentration among manufacturers, who produce innerspring, memory foam and hybrid beds, under nationally recognized brand names, including Tempur Sealy, Stearns & Foster, Serta and Simmons. In recent years, numerous (over 100) direct-to-consumer companies and low cost importers have entered the market, offering “bed-in-a-box” products to consumers primarily through the Internet. These companies market directly to consumers, competing primarily on convenience of online shopping and speed of delivery. Their products are generally foam-based and undifferentiated in terms of sleep benefits.
Governmental Regulation and Compliance
As a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting all aspects of our business.
As a manufacturer, we are committed to product quality and safety, including adherence to all applicable laws and regulations affecting our products. Compliance with federal fire retardant standards developed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, including rigorous and costly testing, has increased the cost and complexity of manufacturing our products and may adversely impact the speed and cost of product development efforts. Further, our manufacturing and other business operations and facilities are, or may, become subject to additional federal, state or local laws or regulations relating to supply chain transparency, conflict minerals sourcing and disclosure, end-of-life disposal and recycling requirements and other laws or regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety requirements. We are not aware of any national or local environmental laws or regulations that may require material capital expenditures or which may materially affect our competitive position or our operational results, financial position or cash flows.
As a retailer, we are subject to additional laws and regulations that apply to retailers generally and govern the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of both our retail stores and our e-commerce activities. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements which impact our retail and e-commerce operations are consumer-focused and pertain to activities such as the advertising and selling of credit-based promotional offers, truth-in-advertising, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements, accessibility and similar requirements.
All of our operations are or may become subject to federal, state and local labor laws including, but not limited to, those relating to occupational health and safety, employee privacy, wage and hour, overtime pay, harassment and discrimination, equal opportunity and employee leaves and benefits. We are also subject to existing and emerging federal and state laws relating to data security.
It is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements and our procedures and internal controls are designed to promote such compliance.
Customers

No single customer accounts for 10% or more of our net sales.
7

Seasonality

Our business is modestly impacted by seasonal influences inherent in the U.S. bedding industry and general retail shopping patterns. The U.S. bedding industry generally experiences lower sales in the second quarter of the calendar year and increased sales during selected holiday or promotional periods.
Working Capital
We are able to operate with minimal working capital requirements because we sell directly to customers, utilize a primarily hybrid "make-to-stock" production process and operate retail stores that serve mainly as showrooms. We have historically generated sufficient cash flows to self-fund operations through an accelerated cash-conversion cycle. In February 2018, we amended our revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks (Lenders). The Credit Agreement provides a revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes with net aggregate availability of $300 million. The Credit Agreement contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the amount of the credit facility from $300 million up to $450 million in total availability, subject to Lenders' approval. The Credit Agreement matures in February 2023.

Qualified customers are offered revolving credit to finance purchases through a private-label consumer credit facility provided by Synchrony Bank. Approximately 47% of our net sales in 2017 were financed by Synchrony Bank. Our current agreement with Synchrony Bank expires December 31, 2020, subject to earlier termination upon certain events and subject to automatic extensions. We pay Synchrony Bank a fee for extended credit promotional financing offers. Under the terms of our agreement, Synchrony Bank sets the minimum acceptable credit ratings, the interest rates, fees and all other terms and conditions of the customer accounts, including collection policies and procedures. As the receivables are owned by Synchrony Bank, at no time are the receivables purchased or acquired from us. We are not liable to Synchrony Bank for our customers' credit defaults. In connection with all purchases financed under these arrangements, Synchrony Bank pays us an amount equal to the total amount of such purchases, net of promotional related discounts, upon delivery to the customer. Customers that do not qualify for credit under our agreement with Synchrony Bank may apply for credit under a secondary program that we offer through another provider.

Team Members

At December 30, 2017, we employed 4,099 individuals, including 2,105 retail sales and support team members, 412 customer service team members, 1,080 manufacturing and logistics team members, and 502 management and administrative team members. Approximately 72 of our team members were employed on a part-time or temporary basis at December 30, 2017. Except for managerial team members and professional support staff, all of our team members are paid on an hourly basis (plus commissions for sales professionals). Additionally, we provide various broad-participation incentive compensation programs tied to various performance objectives. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have a highly engaged team working in a values-driven culture, which we believe is important for an innovation company with such an aspirational vision and life-changing mission.
