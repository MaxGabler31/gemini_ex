Item 1. Business.
 
MGE Energy operates in the following business segments:
 
•Regulated electric utility operations – generating, purchasing, and distributing electricity through MGE.
 
•Regulated gas utility operations – purchasing and distributing natural gas through MGE.
 
•Nonregulated energy operations – owning and leasing electric generating capacity that assists MGE through MGE Energy's wholly owned subsidiaries MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. 
 
•Transmission investments – representing our investment in American Transmission Company LLC, a company engaged in the business of providing electric transmission services primarily in Wisconsin, and our investment in ATC Holdco LLC, a company created to facilitate out-of-state electric transmission development and investments.
 
•All other – investing in companies and property that relate to the regulated operations and financing the regulated operations, through its wholly owned subsidiaries CWDC, MAGAEL, MGE State Energy Services, North Mendota, and Corporate functions.
 
MGE's utility operations represent a majority of the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and operations of MGE Energy. MGE Energy's nonregulated energy operations currently include an undivided interest in two coal-fired generating units located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, which we refer to as the Elm Road Units, and an undivided interest in a cogeneration facility located on the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin, which we refer to as the West Campus Cogeneration Facility or WCCF.
 
As a public utility, MGE is subject to regulation by the PSCW and the FERC. The PSCW has authority to regulate most aspects of MGE's business including rates, accounts, issuance of securities, and plant siting. The PSCW also has authority over certain aspects of MGE Energy as a holding company of a public utility. FERC has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain accounting practices and certain other aspects of MGE's business.

MGE Energy's subsidiaries are also subject to regulation under local, state, and federal laws regarding air and water quality and solid waste disposal. See "Environmental" below.
 
MGE Energy was organized as a Wisconsin corporation in 2001. MGE was organized as a Wisconsin corporation in 1896. Our principal offices are located at 133 South Blair Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53788, and our telephone number is (608) 252-7000.
 
With the global outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, U.S. governmental authorities have deemed electric and gas utilities to be critical infrastructure. MGE Energy therefore has an obligation to keep operating and maintaining our critical electric and gas infrastructure. Since then, MGE Energy has been subject to, and is following, local, state and federal public health and safety regulations and guidance to control the pandemic. MGE Energy has operated continuously throughout the pandemic and has suffered no material disruptions in service or employment. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID 19 Update."
 
Electric Utility Operations
 
MGE distributes electricity in a service area covering a 264 square-mile area of Dane County, Wisconsin. The service area includes the city of Madison, Wisconsin. It owns or leases ownership interests in electric generation facilities located in Wisconsin and Iowa.
 
As of December 31, 2021, MGE supplied electric service to approximately 159,000 customers, with approximately 90% located in the cities of Fitchburg, Madison, Middleton, and Monona and 10% in adjacent areas.



Electric sales, customers, and revenues for 2021 were comprised of the following:
 


Electric operations accounted for approximately 69.4%, 73.2%, and 71.9% of MGE's total 2021, 2020, and 2019 regulated revenues, respectively.
 
See Item 2. Properties for a description of MGE's electric utility plant.
 
MGE is registered with North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and one regional entity, the Midwest Reliability Organization. The essential purposes of these entities are to develop and implement regional and NERC reliability standards and determine compliance with those standards, including enforcement mechanisms.
 
Transmission
 
American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) was formed by Wisconsin-based utilities who were required by Wisconsin law to contribute their transmission facilities to it in 2001 and is owned by those utilities and their affiliates. ATC's purpose is to provide reliable, economic transmission service to all customers in a fair and equitable manner. ATC plans, constructs, operates, maintains, and expands transmission facilities that it owns to provide adequate and reliable transmission of power. ATC is regulated by FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service. ATC is also regulated by the PSCW for some aspects of its governance and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO.
Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO)
 
MISO
 MGE is a nontransmission owning member of the MISO. MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, is responsible for monitoring the electric transmission system that delivers power from generating plants to wholesale power transmitters. MISO's role is to ensure equal access to the transmission system and to maintain or improve electric system reliability across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.

MISO maintains a bid-based energy market. MGE offers substantially all of its generation on the MISO market and purchases much of its load requirement from the MISO market in accordance with the MISO Tariff. MGE participates in the ancillary services market operated by MISO. That market is an extension of the existing energy market in which MISO assumes the responsibility of maintaining sufficient generation reserves. In the ancillary services market, MISO provides the reserves for MGE's load, and MGE may offer to sell reserves from its generating units.

MGE participates in the voluntary capacity auction, which provides an optional monthly forum for buyers and sellers of aggregate planning resource credits to interact. Load serving entities such as MGE may participate in the voluntary capacity auction potentially to obtain the necessary aggregate planning resource credits needed to meet

their planning reserve margin requirement established by the PSCW. Generator owners may participate to sell any excess aggregate planning resource credits.

Fuel supply and generation
 
MGE satisfies its customers' electric demand with internal generation and purchased power. MGE's current fuel mix for generation fluctuates from year-to-year due to fuel pricing in the market, generating unit availability, weather, and customer demand. MGE has a responsibility to its customers to dispatch the lowest cost generation available pursuant to regulatory requirements.
 
During 2021, MGE's electric energy delivery requirements were satisfied from the following fuel sources:
 

(in MWh) | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Coal | | 1,797,017 | | 1,566,204 | | 1,751,224
Natural gas | | 405,696 | | 502,387 | | 501,093 
Renewable sources(a) | | 581,374 | | 485,965 | | 470,716 
Fuel oil | | 884 | | 472 | | 695 
Purchased power - other(b)(c) | | 726,008 | | 789,058 | | 762,894 
Total fuel sources | | 3,510,979 | | 3,344,086 | | 3,486,622
Adjusted total fuel sources(c) | | 3,743,743 | | 3,663,569 | | 3,807,652

 
(a)Includes both internal generation and purchased power.
 (b)Includes third-party purchased power and MISO market activity. A significant percentage of MGE's electric supply comes from internal generation sources. MGE supplements this internal generation with long-term purchase power agreements and spot purchases in the MISO market. 
 (c)The MISO market consists of two energy markets, the Day-ahead market and the Real-time market. The table above nets purchases and sales within the same hour in the two MISO markets. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the amount netted between Day-ahead and the Real-time MISO markets was 232,764 MWh, 319,483 MWh, and 321,030 MWh, respectively. These amounts are reflected in "Adjusted total fuel sources."
 
In May 2019, MGE announced the goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. This goal followed the previous carbon reduction goals, set in 2015 in our Energy 2030 framework, which targeted a 40% carbon reduction by 2030 from 2005 levels. In January 2022, MGE announced a new target of 80% carbon reduction by 2030, significantly exceeding the original 2030 goal. MGE's carbon reduction goals are aligned with those of the scientific community, specifically the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its recommendation of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In 2020, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies released its analysis of MGE's goal of reaching net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. The IPCC modeling available suggested that by 2050, emissions from electricity generation in industrialized countries should be 87% to 99% lower than the 2005 baseline. The study determined that our 2050 goal is in line with model benchmarks to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

MGE's future path to achieve its new target of 80% carbon reduction by 2030 is based on the transition away from coal and the addition of new renewable generation to reach our ultimate target of net-zero carbon by 2050.
 
Transition away from coal - In February 2021, MGE and the other co-owners of Columbia, a two-unit coal-fired generation facility located near Portage, Wisconsin, announced plans to retire that facility. MGE currently owns 19% of the facility. The co-owners intend to retire Unit 1 by the end of 2023 and Unit 2 by the end of 2024. Final timing and retirement dates are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, and other factors. MGE is a minority owner of the coal-fired Elm Road Generating Station in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. In late 2021, MGE announced plans to transition the units from coal to natural gas as its primary fuel source. By 2025, with the planned retirement of both units at Columbia, MGE will have eliminated approximately two-thirds of the company’s current coal-fired generation capacity. MGE's remaining use of coal is expected to be further reduced as the Elm Road Units transition to natural gas. This transition will help MGE meet its 2030 carbon reduction goal. By 2035, MGE expects that the Elm Road Units will be fully transitioned away from coal, which will eliminate coal as an owned generation source for MGE.
 

Renewable generation - Our solar, wind, and battery storage projects, as described below, are a major step toward deep decarbonization and greater use of clean energy sources in pursuit of our net-zero carbon goal. Additionally, MGE seeks to reduce its use of fossil fuels and work to help customers with energy efficiency and electrification, including the electrification of transportation.
 
Since 2015, MGE has announced several new joint and wholly-owned utility-scale wind and solar projects, which are expected to increase MGE's owned renewable capacity by more than nine times when completed by 2024. Following is a timeline of when these renewable energy projects have been completed or expected to be completed and MGE's share of capacity.
 

MGE is working to achieve a more sustainable energy future by investing in cost-effective renewable generation and innovative new technologies and services for customers. MGE has emphasized this innovation by developing customer programs to address climate change and encourage our customers to use clean energy. Our Renewable Energy Rider and Shared Solar programs reduce MGE's carbon emissions while providing customers the ability to purchase renewable energy to meet their energy needs, and we have been working on many fronts in the community to further the electrification of transportation.
    Renewable Energy Rider (RER) – Under this program, MGE partners with large energy users on customized renewable energy solutions. MGE owns the generation assets and RER customers are billed a contractual renewable resource rate for all costs associated with the construction and ongoing operations of the renewable generation facility. This contractual rate is approved by the PSCW and subject to terms and conditions specified in the RER rate schedule. The program entitles RER customers to the contractually-specified energy output of the renewable energy resource. MGE will continue to recover the distribution system costs related to the energy consumed by these customers. Dane County Solar serves the Dane County municipal government. Morey Field RER serves the City of Middleton and Middleton-Cross Plains School District. The O'Brien Solar Fields primarily serve

governmental entities such as UW-Madison, Wisconsin Department of Administration, and the City of Fitchburg. Hermsdorf will serve the City of Madison and Madison Metropolitan School District.
    Shared Solar Program – This program provides an opportunity for eligible customers to add locally-generated solar to their energy mix without having to install solar panels on their premises. The first solar array associated with this program, owned by MGE, became operational in 2017 and was fully subscribed for its capacity value of 500 KW. MGE expanded the program by completing construction of a second solar facility (Morey Field), which added 3.5 MW of capacity to the program in 2020.
 
Electrifying transportation - The electrification of transportation is a key strategy for reducing carbon emissions. MGE has a network of 45 charging stations, powered by renewable energy, serving the growing number of electric vehicles (EV) in our service area. The new EV fast charging hub began serving drivers in late 2021 and features some of the most powerful EV chargers in the Midwest. Charge@Home, MGE's home EV charging program, makes it easy for EV drivers to charge efficiently and conveniently. We have continued to add EVs to our fleet and are targeting 100% all-electric or plug-in hybrid light-duty vehicles by 2030. Additionally, we are working with the City of Madison to further the electrification of its vehicles and recently assisted with the addition of three all-electric buses to Madison's public transportation fleet.

Natural gas as a fuel source - In January 2022, MGE, along with joint applicants, filed an application with the PSCW requesting approval for a sale and purchase of ownership interests in the West Riverside Energy Center, a highly efficient, state-of-the-art natural gas-fired plant in Beloit, Wisconsin. If approved, MGE's share of West Riverside will be 25 MW. The closing and actual transfer of ownership is expected to occur in March 2023. MGE also retains the option to purchase an additional 25 MW of capacity from West Riverside until May 2025. MGE currently expects to exercise this option in a future period. Natural gas has much lower carbon emission rates compared to coal-fired generation. The investment in the West Riverside plant will help MGE to retire Columbia ahead of schedule in order to dramatically increase the amount of clean energy in our generating mix.
    Generation sources
 MGE receives electric generation supply from coal-fired, gas-fired, and renewable energy sources. These sources include owned facilities as well as facilities leased from affiliates and accounted for under our nonregulated energy operations. See Item 2. Properties for more information regarding these generation sources, including location, capacity, ownership or lease arrangement, and fuel source. See "Nonregulated Energy Operations" below for more information regarding generating capacity leased to MGE by nonregulated subsidiaries.
 
Purchased power
 MGE enters into short- and long-term purchase power commitments with third parties to meet a portion of its anticipated electric energy supply needs. The following table identifies purchase power commitments as of December 31, 2021, with unaffiliated parties for the next five years.
 

(Megawatts) | 2022 | | 2023 | | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 
Purchase power commitments | | 33 | | 30 | | 30 | | 30 | 30

Gas Utility Operations
 
MGE transports and distributes natural gas in a service area covering 1,684 square miles in seven south-central Wisconsin counties. The service area includes the city of Madison, Wisconsin and surrounding areas.
 

As of December 31, 2021, MGE supplied natural gas service to approximately 169,000 customers in the cities of Elroy, Fitchburg, Lodi, Madison, Middleton, Monona, Prairie du Chien, Verona, and Viroqua; 27 villages; and all or parts of 53 townships. Gas sales, customers, and revenues for 2021 were comprised of the following:
 


Gas operations accounted for approximately 30.6%, 26.8%, and 28.1% of MGE's total 2021, 2020, and 2019 regulated revenues, respectively.
 
MGE can curtail gas deliveries to interruptible customers. These are customers who agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption. Approximately 3% of retail gas deliveries in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were to interruptible customers.
 
Gas supply
 
MGE has physical interconnections with ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) and Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG). MGE's primary service territory, which includes Madison and the surrounding area, receives deliveries at one NNG and four ANR gate stations. MGE's outlying territory receives deliveries at NNG gate stations located in Elroy, Prairie du Chien, Viroqua, and Crawford County. Interconnections with two major pipelines provide competition in interstate pipeline service and a more reliable and economical gas supply mix, which includes gas from Canada and the mid-continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States.

During the winter months, when customer demand is high, MGE is primarily concerned with meeting its obligation to customers. MGE meets customer demand by using firm supplies under contracts finalized before the heating season, supplies in storage (injected during the summer), and other firm supplies purchased during the winter period.
 
By contract, a total of 5,918,397 Dth of gas can be injected into ANR's storage fields in Michigan from April 1 through October 31. These gas supplies are then available for withdrawal during the subsequent heating season, November 1 through March 31. Using storage allows MGE to buy gas supplies during the summer season, when prices are normally lower, and withdraw these supplies during the winter season, when prices are typically higher. Storage also gives MGE more flexibility in meeting daily load fluctuations.
 
MGE's contracts for firm transportation service of gas include winter maximum daily quantities of:
 
•175,650 Dth (including 106,078 Dth of storage withdrawals) on ANR.
 •80,410 Dth on NNG.
 
Nonregulated Energy Operations
 
MGE Energy, through our subsidiaries, has developed generation sources that assist MGE in meeting the electricity needs of our customers. These sources consist of the Elm Road Units and the WCCF, which are owned by

subsidiaries of MGE Energy and leased to MGE. See Item 2. Properties for a description of these facilities, their joint owners, and the related lease arrangements.
 
Transmission Investments
 
ATC owns and operates electric transmission facilities primarily in Wisconsin. MGE received an interest in ATC when it, like other Wisconsin electric utilities, contributed its electric transmission facilities to ATC as required by Wisconsin law. That interest is presently held by MGE Transco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGE Energy. As of December 31, 2021, MGE Transco held a 3.6% ownership interest in ATC.
 
In 2016, ATC Holdco was formed by several of the members of ATC, including MGE Energy, to facilitate electric transmission development and investments outside of Wisconsin, which typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. ATC Holdco's future transmission development activities have been suspended for the near term. MGE Energy's ownership interest in ATC Holdco is held by MGEE Transco, a wholly-owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2021, MGEE Transco held a 4.4% ownership interest in ATC Holdco.
 
Environmental
 
MGE Energy and MGE are subject to frequently changing local, state, and federal regulations concerning air quality, water quality, land use, threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials handling, and solid waste disposal. These regulations affect the manner in which we conduct our operations, the costs of those operations, as well as capital and operating expenditures. Regulatory initiatives, proposed rules, and court challenges to adopted rules, have the potential to have a material effect on our capital expenditures and operating costs. In addition to the regulations discussed below, MGE continues to track state and federal initiatives such as potential state and federal regulations governing surface water and/or groundwater containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, potential changes to regulations governing polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), potential changes to air and water standards, and potential climate change legislation.
    In February 2021, MGE and the other co-owners of Columbia announced plans to retire that facility. The co-owners intend to retire Unit 1 by the end of 2023 and Unit 2 by the end of 2024. Final timing and retirement dates are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, and other factors. Effects of environmental compliance discussed below will depend upon the final approved retirement dates and compliance requirement dates.
 
Federal and State Environmental Compliance During the Current Pandemic
 
MGE was identified as an essential business under the State of Wisconsin's Safer at Home directive. It has been operating with full staff and has continued to prioritize its compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. MGE continues to follow local orders, as well as state Department of Health and Center for Disease Control guidance to operate in a manner to address potential spread of COVID-19 in order for the essential utility services to operate without interruptions. MGE has developed contingencies for remaining in compliance during the pandemic. However, management cannot predict with certainty whether COVID-19 will disrupt these compliance activities. MGE expects to continue to build contingencies into compliance operations and communicate with regulators as needed during this unprecedented time.
Water Quality
 
EPA's Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category
 The EPA's promulgated water Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) and standards for steam electric power plants focus on the reduction of metals and other pollutants in wastewater from new and existing power plants. MGE's Columbia plant and Elm Road Units are subject to this rule.
    See Footnote 16.a. of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion of compliance plans for Columbia and the Elm Road Units. Management believes that any compliance costs will be recovered in future rates based on previous treatment of environmental compliance projects.
 

EPA Cooling Water Intake Rules (Section 316(b))
 Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act requires that the cooling water intake structures at electric power plants meet best available technology (BTA) standards to reduce mortality from entrainment (drawing aquatic life into a plant's cooling system) and impingement (trapping aquatic life on screens). The EPA finalized its Section 316(b) rule for existing facilities in 2014. Section 316(b) requirements are implemented in Wisconsin through modifications to plants' WPDES permits, which govern plant wastewater discharges.
   WCCF, Blount, and Columbia are subject to this rule. WCCF employs a system that meets the Section 316(b) rule. Blount's WPDES permit assumes that the plant meets BTA for the duration of the permit, which expires in 2023. Before the next permit renewal, MGE is required to complete an entrainment study and recommend a BTA along with other technologies considered. MGE completed the entrainment study in 2021 and submitted the results to the WDNR. The WDNR will make the final BTA determination and include any BTA requirements in Blount's next permit renewal, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 and effective in 2023. Management believes that the BTA determination at Blount will not be material for MGE.
    Section 316(b) applies to river intakes at the Columbia plant. Columbia's operator received a permit in 2019 requiring studies of intake structures to be submitted to the WDNR by November 2023 to help determine BTA. BTA improvements may not be required given that Columbia is scheduled to retire both units by the end of 2024. MGE will continue to work with Columbia's operator to evaluate all regulatory requirements applicable to the planned retirements.

Management believes that the Section 316(b) rule will not have a material effect on its existing plants and that any compliance costs will be recovered in future rates based on previous treatment of environmental compliance projects.
 
Air Quality
 
Air quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and WDNR in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 impose restrictions on emission of particulates, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hazardous air pollutants and other pollutants, and require permits for operation of emission sources. These permits must be renewed periodically. Various newly enacted and/or proposed federal and state initiatives may result in additional operating and capital expenditure costs for fossil-fueled electric generating units.
 
Ozone NAAQS
 In May 2021, the EPA published a final rule that expands several nonattainment areas in Wisconsin to include all of Milwaukee County wherein MGE's Elm Road Units are located. The WDNR must develop a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the area, which will likely result in more stringent requirements for both new development and modification or expansion of existing plants in the area. MGE will monitor the WDNR's SIP development and the extent to which the requirements will impact the Elm Road Units. At this time, MGE does not expect that the 2015 Ozone NAAQS will have a material effect on its existing plants based on final designations.
 
EPA's Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR): Proposed Ozone Season Update based on 2008 Ozone NAAQS
 The EPA's CSAPR and its progeny are a suite of interstate air pollution transport rules designed to reduce ozone and fine particulate (PM2.5) air levels in areas that the EPA has determined as being significantly impacted by pollution from upwind states.
   MGE has met its current obligations through a combination of reduced emissions through pollution control (e.g. SCR installation at Columbia), as well as owned, received, and purchased allowances. MGE expects to meet ongoing CSAPR obligations for the foreseeable future.
 
Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR)
 Columbia is subject to the best available retrofit technology (BART) regulations, a subsection of the EPA's CAVR, which may require pollution control retrofits. Columbia's existing pollution control upgrades, and the EPA's stance that compliance with the CSAPR equals compliance with BART, should mean that Columbia will not need to do additional work to meet BART requirements. Wisconsin's 2021 SIP argues that Wisconsin will meet its current regional haze goals based on expected emissions reductions, which includes Columbia unit retirements. Given that the Wisconsin SIP recognizes the Columbia unit retirements as part of its emission reduction plan, MGE does not
14


anticipate further obligations with this rule at Columbia. MGE will continue to monitor legal developments and any future updates to this rule.
    Global Climate Change
 
MGE is a producer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily from the fossil fuel generating facilities it uses to meet customers' energy needs, as well as from its natural gas pipeline system and fleet vehicles. Climate change and the regulatory response to it could significantly affect our operations in a number of ways, including increased operating costs and capital expenditures, restrictions on energy supply options, operational limits on our fossil fuel fired plants, permitting difficulties, and emission limits. MGE management would expect to seek and receive rate recovery of such compliance costs, if and when required. MGE continues to monitor proposed climate change legislation and regulation.
    MGE has taken steps to address GHG emissions through voluntary actions. In 2005, MGE implemented its Energy 2015 Plan, which committed to ensuring a balanced, economic energy supply with reduced environmental emissions. The Plan emphasized increased renewable energy, energy efficiency, and new cleaner generation – three strategies that reduced GHG emissions. Under the Plan and other actions, our CO2 emissions declined from 2005 to 2015 by approximately 20% even though total system delivered energy increased. In 2015, MGE announced its Energy 2030 framework that continues steps to reduce CO2 emissions. Subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, MGE aims to increase renewable energy to 25% of retail electric sales by 2025 and to 30% by 2030. Under our Energy 2030 framework prior to the announcement of the Columbia retirement, our plan was to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% from 2005 levels by 2030. In January 2022, MGE announced a new target of 80% carbon reduction, significantly exceeding the original 2030 goal. Beyond 2030, we are targeting net-zero carbon electricity by 2050, including our commitment to work with our co-owners at our Elm Road Units to reduce coal use by 2030 and eliminate coal use by 2035.
Federal Action on Climate Change
 
President Biden's actions on climate change, including multiple executive orders and the recommitment of the U.S. to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Paris Agreement), indicate that he intends to make climate considerations a broad focus of his administration.

The executive orders include an order establishing climate change as an essential element of domestic and international governmental policy. The order indicates that the U.S. will develop its emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement, instructs executive staff and federal departments and agencies to take actions to combat climate change using a government-wide approach, and creates several interagency working groups tasked with providing recommendations to meet the order's goals. A second executive order directs executive departments and agencies to review all federal actions taken under the previous presidential administration to determine whether they meet the objectives of protecting the environment, addressing climate change, and addressing public health. The order further instructs those departments and agencies to take applicable action, including suspending, revising or rescinding rules to correct any federal action under the previous administration that does not meet the national objectives set forth in the order. MGE is following the development of recommendations and plans developed by agencies as a result of these orders, as well as other executive actions taken by the new administration, to determine their applicability to MGE's decarbonization plans and to evaluate any potential impact to our operations.
 
In December 2021, President Biden signed an executive order that sets goals for the federal government agencies and operations to have, among other things, 100% carbon-free electricity by 2030, acquisitions of vehicles to be 100% zero-emissions light-duty vehicles by 2027, and all vehicles by 2035, and net-zero emissions from federal operations by 2050. Efforts at the federal level are expected to spur the carbon-neutral economy in the private sector.

Legislative Actions
 MGE is monitoring current legislative actions on climate change to determine their level of significance to MGE's decarbonization plans.
 

State and Regional Action on Climate Change
 
Executive Order Relating to Clean Energy Wisconsin
 In August 2019, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers signed an executive order to establish the Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy (OSCE). The order tasks the OSCE with, among other things, ensuring that the actions of the State of Wisconsin are aligned with the goals and recommendations of the Paris Agreement, verifying that electricity consumed by the State of Wisconsin is 100% carbon-free by 2050, and developing a comprehensive multi-sector clean energy plan for the state. The OSCE has put forth preliminary recommendations and is in the process of creating the statewide plan. MGE is engaged in this process and is participating on a Stakeholder Advisory Team in a voluntary capacity. MGE will be evaluating this plan for its applicability to MGE's decarbonization plans and to evaluate potential impact to our operations.
EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Guidelines under the Clean Air Act 111(d) Rule
 In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (ACE Rule) and repealed the predecessor Clean Power Plan Rule (CPP Rule), both of which regulated greenhouse gas emissions from existing electric generation units pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. MGE is evaluating this D.C. Circuit decision for what impacts it may have on MGE's operations. In October 2021, the EPA formally announced its intention to introduce a proposed GHG rule in July 2022. The EPA has described the pending proposed rule as guidelines for states to regulate GHGs under Section 111(d). MGE will continue to monitor and evaluate the rule development.
Solid Waste
 
EPA's Coal Combustion Residuals Rule
 The EPA's 2015 Coal Combustion Residuals Rule (CCR), which regulates coal ash from burning coal for the purpose of generating electricity as a solid waste and defines what ash use activities would be considered generally exempt beneficial reuse of coal ash. The CCR rule also regulates landfills, ash ponds, and other surface impoundments used for coal combustion residuals by regulating their design, location, monitoring, and operation.
   In July 2018, the EPA published a final rule that included amendments to the CCR. The amendments include the allowance of alternative performance standards for landfills and surface impoundments, revised risk-based groundwater protection standards, and an extension of the deadline by which certain facilities must cease the placement of waste in CCR units. In August 2018, the D.C. Circuit vacated parts of the 2015 CCR for not being sufficiently protective of the environment. In August 2020, the EPA revised the CCR rule to require owners or operators of coal-fired power plants to stop transporting CCR and non-CCR wastewater to unlined surface impoundments. In addition, regulated entities must initiate impoundment closure as soon as feasible and in no event later than April 2021, unless the EPA grants an extension. Columbia requested an extension to initiate closure by October 2022. The EPA has not formally approved the extension. The Columbia owners anticipate that the EPA will approve the extension request. However, we will not know the outcome of the extension request with any certainty until the EPA completes its rules review.
   Review of the Elm Road Units has indicated that the costs to comply with this rule are not expected to be significant. Columbia's operator has completed a review of its system and has developed a compliance plan. See Footnote 16.a. of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further discussion.
Renewable Energy Standards
 
Wisconsin law establishes a minimum amount of energy MGE must supply from renewable sources. MGE currently exceeds the applicable minimum requirement of approximately 8%. The costs to comply with this requirement are being recovered in rates.
Human Capital
 
The energy industry is ever-changing. MGE Energy and MGE believe it is important to continue to engage our human capital resources as our industry evolves. We are committed to sustainable workforce practices such as career development and training. We offer all employees the opportunity to learn and grow—whether the goal is to increase job proficiency, improve decision-making skills, or prepare for new roles and responsibilities. We work

to provide our employees with the tools they need to be successful in their careers. This strategy is essential given our aging workforce and the recent retirement of key employees.
 
We value equity, diversity, and inclusion. We promote an inclusive, respectful work environment where individuals and groups can achieve their full potential. All employees have equitable access to employment and development opportunities. Everyone is responsible for helping to meet the objectives of our diversity and inclusion policy as well as supporting the principles of equal opportunity and affirmative action. We believe that our diversity makes us stronger.
 
Our journey to safety excellence is guided by our Safety Steering Team. The team meets regularly to examine safety topics and to identify and to prioritize continuous improvement opportunities.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic drove several changes in 2020 and continued throughout 2021. These changes range from equipping our field workers with personal protective equipment to offering support to office employees working from home. We continue to address challenges related to the pandemic as they arrive and will continue to meet the critical needs of our community. The safety of our employees and customers is always our top priority.
