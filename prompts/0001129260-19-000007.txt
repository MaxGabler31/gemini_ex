Item 1. | Business

Overview 
We are a provider of secure, integrated, intelligent communication and workflow solutions, focused on empowering mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, energy, and other mission-critical mobile work environments in the United States and internationally. Today, the significant majority of our business is generated from sales of our solutions in the healthcare market to help our customers improve quality of care, patient experience, staff resiliency and operational efficiency. Care teams at nearly 1,600 healthcare facilities worldwide have selected our solutions to call and text securely, reduce alarm fatigue, and to enhance workflow and help improve patient experience. Our solutions can also be found in hotels, nuclear facilities, retail stores and other environments where mobile workers need to communicate and access resources instantly. 
Our communication and collaboration solution, which includes an intelligent enterprise software platform; lightweight, wearable, voice-controlled communication devices; as well as smartphone applications, enables users to connect instantly with other staff simply by saying the name, function or group name of the desired recipient. It also delivers HIPAA-compliant secure text messages, alerts and alarms directly to smartphones and other mobile communication devices both inside and outside the hospital, replacing legacy pagers and in-building wireless phones. 
At the core of this solution is a patent-protected, enterprise-class server software platform. Our software platform is built on a scalable architecture and recognizes more than 100 spoken commands. Users can instantly communicate with others using the Vocera Smartbadge or Vocera Badge, or through client applications for iOS and Android devices. Our platform lets users communicate and collaborate with each other using voice or HIPAA-compliant secure texting, and unlike other solutions, allows users to reach people by their role, room assignment or department, without needing to know a person’s name or phone number. The system can also broadcast emergency messages to a single department or to an entire organization. Our solution can be integrated with other clinical systems, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), nurse call, patient monitoring and even some medical devices, to provide critical data, alerts, alarms and clinical context that enables better workflow. Our enterprise-class software platform also features an advanced clinical rules engine that unifies data from multiple sources simultaneously, enables prioritization of notifications, adds patient context, and sends messages to the right care team members on their mobile devices. Our platform allows clinicians to be away from the bedside while staying informed about their patients. Our portfolio of over 140 unique integrations enhances clinical workflow by enabling the interoperability of our solution with a significant number of clinical and operational systems used in hospitals today.
Beyond healthcare, our solutions are used to quickly and contextually connect staff in other mission-critical mobile-worker environments. In the hospitality industry, it is used to enhance guest experience, as well as staff productivity and responsiveness. In the nuclear power industry, our solutions are used to instantly connect people and resources. In education, schools use our solutions to increase security and staff communication and libraries use it to enable their staff to be more mobile and attentive to patrons.

Over our 19-year history, we have significantly enhanced and added features and functionality to these solutions through ongoing development based on frequent interactions with our customers. In January 2019, we introduced the Vocera Smartbadge which combines smartphone usability with the same wearable, hands-free features as the Vocera Badge. The new Vocera Smartbadge has a 2.4" touchscreen, which enables clinicians view and send secure text messages as well as receive alerts and notifications with patient context.
Vocera Care Experience is a hosted software suite that coordinates and streamlines provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider communication in order to improve quality of care, patient and staff experience, reduce care provider's risk and improve reimbursements.  The solution provides personalized patient instructions and education; provides alerts and notifications to physicians and caregivers of patients’ changing care plans or status; and tracks patient experience before, during and after hospitalization.
Our Experience Innovation Network, a thought leadership collaborative, is a membership-based program designed to spread the adoption of leading strategies to improve patient experience and staff resiliency.
As of December 31, 2018, our solutions were selected by nearly 1,600 healthcare facilities, including large hospital systems, small and medium-sized local hospitals, clinics, surgery centers and aged-care facilities. We sell our solutions to our healthcare customers primarily through our direct sales force in the United States, with resellers for certain U.S. Government business, and through both direct sales and select distribution channels in international markets.
We were incorporated in Delaware on February 16, 2000. Our corporate headquarters are located at 525 Race Street, San Jose, California 95126, and our main telephone number is (408) 882‑5100. We maintain a website at www.vocera.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry overview
Vocera provides communication and workflow solutions for mobile workers in healthcare, hospitality, energy, education and other industries. Healthcare is our largest vertical market.
Hospital communication is still predominantly conducted through multiple disparate, non-integrated systems, including pagers, overhead paging, portable in-building wireless phones and individuals’ personal mobile phones. These non-integrated communication methods are inefficient and often unreliable; not providing “closed loop” communication, workflow standardization, or the scale required by health systems. Further, they often contribute to noisy environments for patients and negatively impact healing, safety, quality of care and operational efficiency.
Broadly, we believe the healthcare industry is placing greater emphasis on the need for better communication and workflow to meet increasing requirements for care quality, patient safety, efficiency and patient satisfaction. Healthcare providers also require greater coordination of care among clinicians as the industry shifts towards population health and paying for value instead of the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model. This shift to value-based purchasing incorporates financial incentives for hospitals to improve the quality of care and patient satisfaction. A number of non-government organizations, such as The Joint Commission, are also requiring improvements in patient safety and quality of care. These forces are driving hospitals to invest in technology and process improvements to manage their operations more efficiently, improve quality of care, and increase patient satisfaction and staff resiliency. Our solutions help hospitals increase productivity and reduce costs by enhancing workflow and improving patient and staff satisfaction through secure, integrated and intelligent communication.
Our strategy
Our goal is to extend our leadership position as a provider of communication and workflow solutions in the healthcare market and add new customers in non-healthcare markets.
Key elements of our strategy include:


• | Expand our business to new U.S. healthcare customers. We believe our solutions can provide significant value to health systems, hospitals and smaller healthcare facilities. We plan to continue to add new customers among hospitals of all sizes, and expand to outpatient clinics and skilled nursing facilities. 


• | Further expand our footprint within our existing installed customer base. Many of our customers initially deploy our solutions in a few departments of a hospital and gradually expand to additional departments as they come to fully appreciate its value. We have a significant opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell to our existing customers, including into new hospitals that are part of an existing healthcare system customer. Key sales strategies include expanding our footprint at existing 

4

customer facilities and capturing additional revenue by cross selling additional solutions. We plan to continue expanding within our existing customers in order to grow our revenue and maintain and improve customer experience. 

• | Extend our technology advantage and create new product solutions. We intend to continue our investment in research and development to enhance the functionality of our solutions and further differentiate them from other competing solutions. As we did with the introduction of the Smartbadge in January 2019, we plan to continue to invest in product upgrades, product line extensions and new solutions to enhance our portfolio, including further development of applications for iOS and Android devices. 


• | Increase our health system selling efforts. Our increasingly comprehensive product suite is enabling us to sell to large health systems. These sales efforts typically involve conversations with more senior decision makers and result in larger deal sizes with complex and elongated sales cycles. We have organized a national accounts sales team to pursue more of these opportunities in the future. 


• | Invest in partnerships. In order to gain access to clinical data and patient context needed to create a highly efficient communication and workflow system for the entire care team, we plan to continue to broaden our ecosystem of technology partners, including vendors that provide nurse call systems, patient monitoring systems, analytics and EHRs. We added new partnerships in 2018 and will continue to explore new relationships that broaden our overall market presence and accelerate the sales of our offerings. 


• | Pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies and assets. Over the last seven years we have completed a number of acquisitions to help us achieve our strategic vision by enhancing our products and enabling us to enter new markets. Our acquisitions have expanded our solutions, demonstrating that we can successfully source, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and assets. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe can accelerate the growth of our business. 


• | Grow our international healthcare presence. Today, in addition to our core U.S. market, we sell into other English-speaking markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Middle Eastern countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar. We believe that the rapid pace of investment in new healthcare facilities in these developing international markets provides a significant opportunity for growth. As of December 31, 2018, our solutions were selected by approximately 280 healthcare facilities outside the United States. We plan to utilize both our direct sales force and leverage channel partners to expand our presence into other markets over time. 


• | Expand our solutions in non-healthcare markets. While our primary focus is on the healthcare market, our solutions also provide great value in non-healthcare markets. Our solutions have been selected by facilities in markets beyond healthcare including hospitality, energy and other mission critical mobile worker environments. Currently, this is not a material portion of our revenue, but longer term, we believe these markets could represent potential opportunities for growth.

Components of the Vocera Communication and Workflow System include:


• | Vocera Software Platform. At the heart of our Vocera Communication and Workflow System is a patent-protected, enterprise-class software platform. The intelligence of our client-server system is contained primarily within our server-software. This platform contains an optimized speech recognition engine, intelligent call routing and management functionality, reporting and analytics tools, clinical directories and user profiles. In addition, our platform has the ability to integrate with a significant number of third-party clinical systems, including telephony, nurse call, patient monitoring and EHR systems. Our software platform features an advanced clinical rules engine that unifies data from multiple sources simultaneously, enables prioritization of notifications, adds patient context, and sends messages to the right care team members on their mobile devices, helping to improve patient safety and satisfaction and increase operational efficiency. By providing real-time situational awareness about the patients and care teams, we enable healthcare workers to be more effective and suffer less from alarm and alert fatigue. Recognizing the rapidly expanding footprint of care, our scalable software platform can support multiple geographic sites and multiple facilities within a healthcare system to help clinicians stay connected to the current status of their patients. 


• | Vocera Smartbadge. Our Smartbadge, launched in January 2019, is the only wearable communication device purpose-built for patient care. Our Smartbadge is powered by the Vocera Software Platform and operates over customers' industry-standard Wi-Fi networks. The Smartbadge has a 2.4” touchscreen and keyboard that enables the user to receive prioritized alert and alarm notifications with additional patient context. Additionally users can make and answer calls hands-free or by holding it up to the ear for privacy, and send and receive secured text messages with no character limit. The Smartbadge also has a dedicated panic button and enhanced "do not disturb" functionality. 


• | Vocera Badge. Our Badge is a smaller and lighter weight hands-free wearable device that allows the users instant two-way voice conversations without the need to remember a phone number or use a handset. Similar to the Smartbadge, it is powered by the Vocera Software Platform and operates over the customers' industry-standard Wi-Fi networks. It has a small display that provides a concise amount of information and allows the user to receive prioritized alarm and alert notifications with limited context. The Badge has received the FIPS 140-2 certification from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We have also received an Authority to Operate (ATO) certification from the U.S. Department of Defense. Both of these certifications are requirements to sell our solutions to U.S. government and military hospital and medical facilities. 


• | Vocera Smartphone Applications. Vocera's suite of smartphone applications enable a seamless multi-mode communications and collaboration experience; combining the unique calling, texting, alerting and content distribution capabilities of Vocera into a secure, easy-to-use smartphone application.

Sales and marketing
Sales
Our sales employees call on hospitals and healthcare systems in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2018, we had 152 sales and account support employees. The sales team is organized to allow us to better serve our customers and to support the different elements of our sales strategy. We supplement our sales organization by utilizing a U.S. government-authorized reseller to facilitate our sales to Veterans Administration and Department of Defense healthcare facilities. We also use resellers in certain international markets to supplement our sales efforts. Certain members of the sales team focus on the development of new customer relationships with large integrated health systems and government healthcare facilities. We enhance our sales efforts by including in our sales staff individuals with nursing backgrounds to address clinical uses with, and provide utilization advice to, customers and potential customers. We have also staffed our sales team with system engineers who focus on the technical elements of system optimization, particularly wireless, and overall product configuration. We have a small direct sales team to focus on developing our non-healthcare business, including hospitality, energy and other mission-critical mobile work environments.

Marketing 
Our marketing efforts focus on building awareness and generating demand. We believe that continuing to increase our brand recognition is important for the growth of our business as well as generating demand for our solutions. As of December 31, 2018, we had 33 employees in marketing, product management and business development.
Our customer-centric marketing strategy is important to generating new sales leads as word of mouth promotion and testimonials are some of our most valuable marketing tools. A number of our customers have agreed to participate in video testimonials, white papers and case studies that validate the efficacy and the financial benefits of our solutions. We have been featured in numerous articles and on network television demonstrating increased patient satisfaction, streamlined hospital operations and enhanced employee satisfaction and safety. Additionally, we sponsor numerous customer-led webinars to demonstrate customer success and to let prospective customers hear from their peer group about the positive impact that our solutions have made on their hospitals. Many of our sales leads come from referrals of existing customers or users who have moved from a hospital already using Vocera to a new facility or health system. We also invest in digital outreach to better influence buyers early on in their decision-making. 
We have an integrated product management organization that manages the full lifecycle of our products and services; from strategy through execution to end-of-life. Our product roadmaps are driven by current and prospective customers and continually validated using primary and secondary research. We collect customer feedback through surveys and focus groups, customer visits, a customer advisory board, user forums and participation in industry standards organizations. Integral to this team are product managers and user experience designers skilled in clinical and operating workflows, and business development resources that create and manage the ecosystems of clinical and technology system partners. 
Customers
Our solutions have been selected by more than 1,850 facilities worldwide. Of these, nearly 1,600 are hospitals and other healthcare facilities, and approximately 280 are outside of the United States. Our healthcare customers include national and international health and hospital systems, large and medium-sized independent and academic hospitals, small hospitals and healthcare facilities, and U.S. governmental hospitals and care facilities. With our diverse customer base, we have very low customer revenue concentration. 
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, non-U.S. markets represented approximately 10.2%, 10.2%, and 10.4% of our revenue, respectively. We are developing plans to offer our solutions in a wider range of international markets. 
Competition
We do not believe any single competitor offers a similar intelligent communication system to the healthcare market that allows instant, hands-free communication through voice-activated, role-based and activity-based calling, secure texting, and clinical integrations and workflows, and that features an advanced clinical rules engine that unifies data from multiple sources simultaneously on a combination of dedicated, proprietary devices, as well as third-party smartphones and other devices.
At this time, the primary alternative to our system consists of a combination of traditional communication methods utilizing wired phones, wireless in-building phones, smartphones, pagers and overhead paging systems. 
The most significant alternative with which we compete for sales in the hospital are in-building wireless telephones and smartphone applications. While we compete with the providers of these wireless phones in making sales to hospitals, they do not at this time purport to contain the system intelligence, integrated workflow and convenience of our communication and workflow solutions. The market for in-building wireless phones is dominated by large communications companies such as Cisco Systems, Ascom and Spectralink. 
Additionally, we compete against Epic and Cerner, both of which have their own smartphone application for secure texting. We differentiate against these Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendors as we enable hands-free communication via our Smartbadge and Badge and clinical workflow with our large portfolio of over 140 system integrations.
We believe that the use of mobile smartphone apps for healthcare will continue to expand in our target market and may represent a source of competition but this trend also represents an opportunity to expand our communication solutions with our smartphone applications, which enable all members of the patient's care team to connect to our software platform and participate as users on our Communication system. 
We believe that the primary competitive factors at work in our market include:


• | comprehensiveness of the solution and the features provided and the ability to purchase the complete solution from a single vendor


• | product performance and reliability


• | the initial cost and ongoing cost of ownership


• | customer service and support capabilities

8

We may face increased competition in the future, including from large, multinational companies or private equity backed organizations with significant resources. Potential competitors may have existing relationships with purchasers of other products and services within the hospital, which may enhance their ability to gain a foothold in our market. In addition, the continuing expansion of our communication and workflow collaboration capabilities, may introduce us to a broader set of competitors. These competitors may include companies that provide clinical workflow solutions, enterprise software, cloud-based solutions and electronic health records.
Research and development
Our continued investment in research and development is critical to our business. We have assembled teams of engineers with expertise in various fields, including software, firmware, database design, applications, speech recognition, wireless communication and hardware design. We employ research and development personnel in San Jose, California; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Knoxville, Tennessee; Toronto, Canada and Bangalore, India. There were 179 full-time research and development employees as of December 31, 2018. We also utilized small teams of contractors in India and Ukraine to assist with quality assurance testing and automation, and targeted development efforts. 
Intellectual property 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
We held 28 U.S. patents as of December 31, 2018, including patents on many capabilities of our software platform and wearable devices.  The expiration dates of these patents range from 2021 through 2032. One or more utility patents have also been issued in Australia, Canada, India, Japan and the European Patent Office (with validation in Germany, United Kingdom and Netherlands). A European Community design patent has been issued that protects the design in multiple European jurisdictions. 
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including non-disclosure agreements and other statutory and contractual protections applicable to employees, contractors, customers and partners. These protections include U.S. and international copyright laws.
Our solutions include software developed and owned by us as well as software components we have licensed. These non-exclusive licenses are terminable by the licensor for cause. Certain of these licenses are for a contractually specified term and cannot be renewed without the assent of the licensor. In the event one or more of these licenses is terminated or is not renewed, we could be required to redesign substantial portions of our software in order to incorporate software components from alternative sources. An unplanned redesign of our software could materially and adversely affect our business.
Manufacturing operations and suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing of our wearable device products to original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, including Sercomm and SMTC Corporation (SMTC). Our Vocera Smartbadge is built in Taiwan and our Vocera Badge is made in Mexico using custom tools and test equipment owned by us. Most of our accessories, including batteries, chargers and attachments, are built by original design manufacturers (ODMs) in Asia.
These manufacturers are responsible for procuring all the components included in our products, as specified and approved by us. Some of these components are sole-sourced off-the-shelf and some are custom components built exclusively for our products. In the event we are unable to procure certain components, we could be required to redesign some of our products in order to incorporate technology from alternative sources. An unplanned redesign of our products could materially and adversely affect our business.
We require our suppliers to perform both incoming and outgoing product inspections. In addition, we perform in-house quality control and ongoing reliability testing.
We also resell the Zebra Technologies TC51 Android mobile computer. These devices are offered as a bundled solution with our smartphone applications to provide a complete, turnkey solution for our customers’ clinical communication needs.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 630 employees, consisting of 20 in manufacturing and quality operations, 179 in research and development, 185 in sales and marketing, 181 in services and support and 65 in general and administrative. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. We consider current employee relations to be good.
9

Backlog 
Our backlog of undelivered orders was $61.8 million and $64.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of the current backlog, all but $28.9 million is expected to be delivered in 2019.
Government regulations and standards
Substantially all of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. These factors affect the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations, as well as the behavior and attitudes of our users. Representatives of the U.S. federal legislature and agencies have announced plans to reform or revise aspects of the U.S. healthcare system and we expect these efforts to continue over the next several years. We also expect federal and state legislatures and agencies to continue to consider new programs to reform or revise aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. These programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate.
HIPAA privacy and security standards
In connection with our healthcare communications business, we access personal health information on behalf of our customers. Accordingly, in the United States, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers engaged in electronic transactions, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards as reflected in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (HITECH). Among other things, the new law makes certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Most of our customers are covered entities under HIPAA and, to the extent that we access personal health information on their behalf, we are their “business associates” and are subject to HIPAA and associated contractual obligations, as well as comparable state privacy and security laws.
In addition, we are subject to privacy and security regulations in other jurisdictions. For example, the European Union (EU) adopted the Data Protection Directive (DPD) (officially Directive 95/46/EC), imposing strict regulations and establishing a series of requirements regarding the storage of personally identifiable information on computers or recorded on other electronic media. This has been implemented by all EU member states through national laws. DPD provides for specific regulations requiring all non-EU countries doing business with EU member states to provide adequate data privacy protection when receiving personal data from any of the EU member states. In May 2016, the EU formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which applied to all EU member states beginning May 2018 and replaces the current DPD. The regulation introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new EU data protection rules. Additionally, Canada’s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.
These statutes, regulations and contractual obligations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we must comply, and subject us to material liability and other adverse impacts to our business in the event we fail to do so. These include, without limitation, civil fines, criminal sanctions in certain circumstances, contractual liability to our customers, and damage to our brand and reputation. We endeavor to mitigate these risks through measures we believe to be appropriate for the specific circumstances, including storing personal data under our control on password-protected systems in secure facilities, counseling our customers as to best practices in using our solutions, and encrypting such information.
Medical device regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates certain products, including software-based products, as “medical devices” based, in part, on the intended use of the product and the risk the device poses to the patient should the device fail to perform properly. We have concluded that our communication products are general-purpose communication solutions and are not subject to FDA regulation. However, either the FDA could disagree with our conclusion or changes in our product or the FDA’s evolving regulations could lead to the imposition of medical device regulation on more of our products. In this event, we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including the expense of compliance with Medical Device Reporting and Quality System regulation and the potential of liability for failure to comply, and we could be required to obtain 510(k) clearance 
10

or premarket approval of those products from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. Some of the products acquired as a result of the Extension Healthcare and mVisum acquisitions are regulated by the FDA as Class II medical devices under applicable law and FDA regulations. This includes potentially being subject to the 2.3% excise tax that was initially legislated under the Affordable Care Act, but which has been delayed through 2019 by a moratorium on the tax included in recent Congressional budget legislation passed in January of 2018. Class II devices are devices classified by the FDA as posing a moderate to high risk and therefore subject to both “general controls” and “special controls,” as such terms are defined in the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Further, our other products could become subject to the 2.3% excise tax when it becomes effective, if the FDA were to determine in the future that they constitute medical devices.
Electrical standards and FCC regulations
Our products emit radio frequency energy in the 2.4 and 5.0 GHz spectrum bands for which licensing by U.S. and other regulatory authorities is not required, provided that the products conform to certain requirements, e.g., maximum power output and tolerance of interference from other devices sharing that spectrum band. We subject our products to testing by independent testing laboratories for compliance with the relevant standards issued by various U.S. and international bodies, including the EU (with respect to the “CE” mark), the International Electrotechnical Commission, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Underwriters Laboratories and CSA International.
