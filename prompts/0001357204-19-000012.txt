Item 1. Business. 
Our Company 
We are one of the world’s leading franchisors of quick service restaurants (“QSRs”) serving hot and cold coffee and baked goods, as well as hard serve ice cream. We franchise restaurants under our Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins brands. With over 20,900 points of distribution in more than 60 countries worldwide, we believe that our portfolio has strong brand awareness in our key markets. 
We believe that our 100% franchised business model offers strategic and financial benefits. For example, because we generally do not own or operate restaurants, our Company is able to focus on menu innovation, marketing, franchisee coaching and support, and other initiatives to drive the overall success of our brand. Financially, our franchised model allows us to grow our points of distribution and brand recognition with limited capital investment by us. 
We report our business in five segments: Dunkin’ U.S., Dunkin’ International, Baskin-Robbins International, Baskin-Robbins U.S., and U.S. Advertising Funds. In fiscal year 2018, our Dunkin’ segments generated revenues of $629.2 million, or 50% of our total segment revenues, of which $606.8 million was in the U.S. segment and $22.3 million was in the international segment. In fiscal year 2018, our Baskin-Robbins segments generated revenues of $162.8 million, of which $115.4 million was in the international segment and $47.4 million was in the U.S. segment. In fiscal year 2018, our U.S. Advertising Funds segment generated revenues of $454.6 million. As of December 29, 2018, there were 12,871 Dunkin’ points of distribution, of which 9,419 were in the U.S. and 3,452 were international, and 8,041 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, of which 5,491 were international and 2,550 were in the U.S. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for segment information.
We generate revenue from five primary sources: (i) royalty income and franchise fees associated with franchised restaurants; (ii) continuing advertising fees from Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins franchisees and breakage and other revenue related to the gift card program; (iii) rental income from restaurant properties that we lease or sublease to franchisees; (iv) sales of ice cream and other products to franchisees in certain international markets; and (v) other income including fees for the licensing of our brands for products sold in certain retail channels (such as Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods, retail packaged coffee, and ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee), the licensing of the rights to manufacture Baskin-Robbins ice cream products to a third party for sale to U.S. franchisees, refranchising gains, and online training fees. Prior to completing the sale of all company-operated restaurants in fiscal year 2016, we also generated revenue from retail store sales at our company-operated restaurants.
Our history 
Both of our brands have a rich heritage dating back to the 1940s, when Bill Rosenberg founded his first restaurant, subsequently renamed Dunkin’ Donuts, and Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins each founded a chain of ice cream shops that eventually combined to form Baskin-Robbins. Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin’ Donuts were individually acquired by Allied Domecq PLC in 1973 and 1989, respectively. The brands were organized under the Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants subsidiary, which was renamed Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. in 2004. Allied Domecq was acquired in July 2005 by Pernod Ricard S.A. In March of 2006, Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. was acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC, The Carlyle Group, and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. through a holding company that was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2005 and was later renamed Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. In July 2011, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”). Upon the completion of the IPO, our common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “DNKN.” In 2018, the Company unveiled new branding for Dunkin' Donuts that officially recognizes the brand as simply “Dunkin',” which officially took place in January 2019. 
Our brands
Dunkin’ U.S. 
Dunkin’ is a leading U.S. QSR concept, and is the QSR leader in donut and bagel categories for servings. Dunkin’ is also a national QSR leader for breakfast sandwich servings. Since the late 1980s, Dunkin’ has transformed itself into a coffee and beverage-based concept, and is a national QSR leader in servings in the hot regular/decaf/flavored coffee category and the iced regular/decaf/flavored coffee category, with sales of approximately 1.7 billion servings of total hot and iced coffee annually. Over the last ten fiscal years, Dunkin’ U.S. systemwide sales have grown at a 5.4% compound annual growth rate and total Dunkin’ U.S. points of distribution grew from 6,412 to 9,419. As of December 29, 2018, approximately 85% of these points of distribution are traditional restaurants consisting of end-cap, in-line and stand-alone restaurants, many with drive-thrus, and gas and convenience locations. In addition, we have special distribution opportunities (“SDOs”), such as full- or self-service kiosks in offices, hospitals, colleges, airports, grocery stores, wholesale clubs, and other smaller-footprint properties. We believe that Dunkin’ continues to have significant growth potential in the U.S. given its strong brand awareness and variety of restaurant 
- 1-

formats. For fiscal year 2018, the Dunkin’ franchise system generated U.S. systemwide sales of $8.8 billion, which accounted for approximately 76% of our global systemwide sales, and had 9,419 U.S. points of distribution (with more than 50% of our restaurants having drive-thrus) at period end. 
Baskin-Robbins U.S. 
Baskin-Robbins is the leading QSR chain in the U.S. for servings of hard-serve ice cream, according to CREST® data, and develops and sells a full range of frozen ice cream treats such as cones, cakes, sundaes, and frozen beverages. Baskin-Robbins enjoys strong brand awareness in the U.S., and we believe the brand is known for its innovative flavors, popular “Birthday Club” program and ice cream flavor library of over 1,300 different offerings. We believe we can capitalize on the brand’s strengths and continue generating renewed excitement for the brand. Baskin-Robbins’ “31 flavors” offers consumers a different flavor for each day of the month. For fiscal year 2018, the Baskin-Robbins franchise system generated U.S. systemwide sales of approximately $611.9 million, which accounted for approximately 5% of our global systemwide sales. 
International operations 
Our international business is primarily conducted via joint ventures and country or territorial license arrangements with “master franchisees,” who operate and sub-franchise the brand within their licensed areas. Our international franchise system, predominantly located across Asia and the Middle East, generated systemwide sales of $2.2 billion for fiscal year 2018, which represented approximately 19% of Dunkin’ Brands’ global systemwide sales. As of December 29, 2018, Dunkin’ had 3,452 international points of distribution in 43 countries (excluding the U.S.), which grew from 2,405 points of distribution as of December 27, 2008, and represented $775.5 million of international systemwide sales for fiscal year 2018. As of December 29, 2018, Baskin-Robbins had 5,491 international points of distribution in 53 countries (excluding the U.S.) and represented approximately $1.5 billion of international systemwide sales for fiscal year 2018. We believe that we have opportunities to continue to grow our Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins concepts internationally in new and existing markets through brand and menu differentiation. 
Overview of franchising 
Franchising is a business arrangement whereby a service organization, the franchisor, grants an operator, the franchisee, a license to sell the franchisor’s products and services and use its system and trademarks in a given area, with or without exclusivity. In the context of the restaurant industry, a franchisee pays the franchisor for its concept, strategy, marketing, operating system, training, purchasing power, and brand recognition. Franchisees are solely responsible for the day-to-day operations in each franchised restaurant, including but not limited to all labor and employment decisions, such as hiring, promoting, discharging, scheduling, and setting wages, benefits, and all other terms of employment with respect to their employees.
Franchisee relationships 
We seek to maximize the alignment of our interests with those of our franchisees. For instance, we do not derive additional income through serving as the supplier to our domestic franchisees. In addition, because the ability to execute our strategy is dependent upon the strength of our relationships with our franchisees, we maintain a multi-tiered advisory council system to foster an active dialogue with franchisees. The advisory council system provides feedback and input on all major brand initiatives and is a source of timely information on evolving consumer preferences, which assists new product introductions and advertising campaigns. 
Unlike certain other QSR franchise systems, we generally do not guarantee our franchisees’ financing obligations. From time to time, at our discretion, we may offer voluntary financing to existing franchisees for specific programs such as the purchase of specialized equipment. We intend to continue our past practice of limiting our guarantee of financing for franchisees. 
Franchise agreement terms 
For each franchised restaurant in the U.S., we enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions. A prospective franchisee may elect to open either a single-branded distribution point or a multi-branded distribution point. In addition, and depending upon the market, a franchisee may purchase the right to open a franchised restaurant at one or multiple locations (via a store development agreement, or “SDA”). When granting the right to operate a restaurant to a potential franchisee, we will generally evaluate the potential franchisee’s prior food-service experience, history in managing profit and loss operations, financial history, and available capital and financing. We also evaluate potential new franchisees based on financial measures, including liquid asset and net worth minimums for each brand. 
The typical franchise agreement in the U.S. has a 20-year term. The majority of our franchisees have entered into prime leases with a third-party landlord. The Company is the lessee on certain land leases (the Company leases the land and erects a 
- 2-

building) or improved leases (lessor owns the land and building) covering restaurants and other properties. In addition, the Company has leased and subleased land and buildings to other franchisees. When we sublease properties to franchisees, the sublease generally follows the prime lease term. Our leases to franchisees are typically for an overall term of 20 years. 
We help domestic franchisees select sites and develop restaurants that conform to the physical specifications of our typical restaurant. Each domestic franchisee is responsible for selecting a site, but must obtain site approval from us based on accessibility, visibility, proximity to other restaurants, and targeted demographic factors including population density and traffic patterns. Additionally, the franchisee must also refurbish and remodel each restaurant periodically (typically every five and ten years, respectively). 
We currently require each domestic franchisee’s managing owner and/or designated manager to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us, including minimum periods of classroom and on-the-job training. We monitor operations in the U.S. with regard to compliance with our standards for restaurant operations and use “Guest Satisfaction Surveys” in the U.S. to assess customer satisfaction with restaurant operations, such as product quality, restaurant cleanliness, and customer service.
Store development agreements 
We grant domestic franchisees the right to open one or more restaurants within a specified geographic area pursuant to the terms of SDAs. An SDA specifies the number of restaurants and the mix of the brands represented by such restaurants that a franchisee is obligated to open. Each SDA also requires the franchisee to meet certain milestones in the development and opening of the restaurant and, if the franchisee meets those obligations, we agree, during the term of such SDA, not to operate or franchise new restaurants in the designated geographic area covered by such SDA. In addition to an SDA, a franchisee signs a separate franchise agreement for each restaurant developed under such SDA. 
Master franchise model and international arrangements 
Master franchise arrangements are used on a limited basis domestically (the Baskin-Robbins brand has one “territory” franchise agreement for certain Midwestern markets) but more widely internationally for both the Baskin-Robbins brand and the Dunkin’ brand. In addition, international arrangements include joint venture agreements in South Korea (both brands), Australia (Baskin-Robbins brand), and Japan (Baskin-Robbins brand), as well as single unit franchises, such as in Canada (Baskin-Robbins brand). We utilize a multi-franchise system in certain markets, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Mexico. 
Master franchise agreements are the most prevalent international relationships for both brands. Under these agreements, the applicable brand grants the master franchisee the limited exclusive right to develop and operate a certain number of restaurants within a particular geographic area, such as selected cities, one or more provinces or an entire country, pursuant to a development schedule that defines the number of restaurants that the master franchisee must open annually. Those development schedules customarily extend for five to ten years. If the master franchisee fails to perform its obligations, the limited exclusivity provision of the agreement may terminate and additional franchise agreements may be granted to third parties to develop additional restaurants. 
The master franchisee is generally required to pay an upfront market development fee and an upfront initial franchise fee for each developed restaurant, and, for the Dunkin’ brand, royalties. For the Baskin-Robbins brand, the master franchisee is typically required to purchase ice cream from Baskin-Robbins or an approved supplier. In most countries, the master franchisee is also required to spend a certain percentage of gross sales on advertising in such foreign country in order to promote the brand. Generally, the master franchise agreement serves as the franchise agreement for the underlying restaurants operating pursuant to such model. Depending on the individual agreement, we may permit the master franchisee to subfranchise within its territory.
Within each of our master franchisee and joint venture organizations, training programs have been established by the master franchisee or joint venture based on our specifications. From those training facilities, the master franchisee or joint venture trains future staff members of the international restaurants. Our master franchisees and joint venture entities also periodically send their primary training managers to the U.S. for re-certification.

Franchise fees 
In the U.S., once a franchisee is approved, a restaurant site is approved, and a franchise agreement is signed, the franchisee will begin to develop the restaurant. Franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee for the right to operate a restaurant for one or more franchised brands. The franchisee is required to pay all or part of the initial franchise fee upfront upon execution of the franchise agreement, regardless of when the restaurant is actually opened. Initial franchise fees vary by brand, type of development agreement and geographic area of development, but generally range from $25,000 to $100,000, as shown in the table below. 

Restaurant type | | Initial franchise fee*
Dunkin’ Single-Branded Restaurant | $ | 40,000-90,000 
Baskin-Robbins Single-Branded Restaurant | $ | 25,000 
Dunkin’/Baskin-Robbins Multi-Branded Restaurant | $ | 50,000-100,000 


* | Fees as of January 1, 2019 and excludes SDOs

In addition to the payment of initial franchise fees, our U.S. Dunkin’ brand franchisees, U.S. Baskin-Robbins brand franchisees, and our international Dunkin’ brand franchisees pay us royalties on a percentage of the gross sales made from each restaurant. In the U.S., the majority of our franchise agreement renewals and the vast majority of our new franchise agreements require our franchisees to pay us a royalty of 5.9% of gross sales. During fiscal year 2018, our effective royalty rate in the Dunkin’ U.S. segment was approximately 5.5% and in the Baskin-Robbins U.S. segment was approximately 4.8%. The arrangements for Dunkin’ in the majority of our international markets require royalty payments to us of 5.0% of gross sales. However, many of our larger international partners, including our South Korean joint venture partner, have agreements at a lower rate and/or based on wholesale sales to restaurants, resulting in an effective royalty rate in the Dunkin’ International segment in fiscal year 2018 of approximately 2.6%. We typically collect royalty payments on a weekly basis from our domestic franchisees. For the Baskin-Robbins brand in international markets, we do not generally receive royalty payments from our franchisees; instead we earn revenue from such franchisees as a result of our sale of ice cream products to them, and in fiscal year 2018 our effective royalty rate in this segment was approximately 0.5%. In certain instances, we supplement and modify certain SDAs, and franchise agreements entered into pursuant to such SDAs with certain incentives that may (i) reduce or eliminate the initial franchise fee associated with a franchise agreement; (ii) reduce the royalties for a specified period of the term of the franchise agreements depending on the details related to each specific incentive program; (iii) reimburse the franchisee for certain local marketing activities in excess of the minimum required; and (iv) provide certain development incentives. To qualify for any or all of these incentives, the franchisee must meet certain requirements, each of which are set forth in an addendum to the SDA and the franchise agreement. We believe these incentives will lead to accelerated development in our less mature markets. 
Franchisees in the U.S. also pay advertising fees to the brand-specific advertising funds administered by us. Franchisees make weekly contributions, generally 5% of gross sales, to the advertising funds. Franchisees may elect to increase the contribution to support general brand-building efforts or specific initiatives. The advertising funds for the U.S., which earned $454.6 million in revenue in fiscal year 2018 primarily from contributions from franchisees, are almost exclusively franchisee-funded and cover substantially all expenses related to marketing, research and development, innovation, advertising and promotion, including market research, production, advertising costs, public relations, and sales promotions. We use no more than 20% of the advertising funds in the U.S. to cover the administrative expenses of the advertising funds and for other strategic initiatives designed to increase sales and to enhance the reputation of the brands. As the administrator of the advertising funds, we determine the content and placement of advertising, which is done through print, radio, television, online, billboards, sponsorships, and other media, all of which is sourced by agencies. Under certain circumstances, franchisees are permitted to conduct their own local advertising, but must obtain our prior approval of content and promotional plans. 
Other franchise related fees 
We lease and sublease properties to franchisees in the U.S. and in Canada, generating net rental fees when the cost charged to the franchisee exceeds the cost charged to us. For fiscal year 2018, we generated 7.9%, or $104.4 million, of our total revenue from rental fees from franchisees and incurred related occupancy expenses of $58.1 million. 
We also receive a license fee from Dean Foods Co. (“Dean Foods”) as part of an arrangement whereby Dean Foods manufactures and distributes ice cream and other frozen products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees in the U.S. In connection with this agreement, Dunkin’ Brands receives a fee based on net sales of covered products. For fiscal year 2018, we generated 0.8%, or $10.1 million, of our total revenue from license fees from Dean Foods. 
- 4-

We distribute ice cream products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees who operate Baskin-Robbins restaurants located in certain foreign countries and receive revenue associated with those sales. For fiscal year 2018, we generated 7.2%, or $95.2 million, of our total revenue from the sale of ice cream and other products to franchisees primarily in certain foreign countries and incurred related cost of ice cream and other products of $77.4 million. 
Other revenue sources include online training fees, licensing fees earned from the sale of K-Cup® pods, retail packaged coffee, ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, and other branded products, net refranchising gains, and other one-time fees. For fiscal year 2018, we generated 3.0%, or $40.0 million, of our total revenue from these other sources. 
International operations 
Our international business is organized by brand and by country and/or region. Operations are primarily conducted through master franchise agreements with local operators. In certain instances, the master franchisee may have the right to sub-franchise. We utilize a multi-franchise system in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Mexico. In addition, we have a joint venture with a local, publicly-traded company for the Baskin-Robbins brand in Japan, and joint ventures with local companies in Australia for the Baskin-Robbins brand and in South Korea for both the Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins brands. By teaming with local operators, we believe we are better able to adapt our concepts to local business practices and consumer preferences. We have had an international presence since 1961 when the first Dunkin’ restaurant opened in Canada. As of December 29, 2018, there were 5,491 Baskin-Robbins restaurants in 53 countries outside the U.S. and 3,452 Dunkin’ restaurants in 43 countries outside the U.S. Baskin-Robbins points of distribution represent the majority of our international presence and accounted for approximately 65% of international systemwide sales.
Our key markets for both brands are predominantly based in Asia and the Middle East, which accounted for approximately 69% and 17%, respectively, of international systemwide sales for fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, $2.2 billion of total systemwide sales were generated by restaurants located in international markets, which represented approximately 19% of total systemwide sales, with the Dunkin’ brand accounting for $775.5 million and the Baskin-Robbins brand accounting for $1.5 billion of our international systemwide sales. For the same period, our revenues from international operations totaled $137.7 million, with the Baskin-Robbins brand generating approximately 84% of such revenues. 
Overview of key markets 
As of December 29, 2018, the top foreign countries and regions in which the Dunkin’ brand and/or the Baskin-Robbins brand operated were: 

Country/Region | Type | Franchised brand(s) | Number of restaurants
South Korea | Joint Venture | Dunkin’ | 688 
 | | Baskin-Robbins | 1,376 
Japan | Joint Venture | Baskin-Robbins | 1,165 
Middle East | Master Franchise Agreements | Dunkin’ | 603 
 | | Baskin-Robbins | 924 

South Korea 
Restaurants in South Korea accounted for approximately 38% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year 2018. Baskin-Robbins accounted for 74% of such sales. In South Korea, we conduct business through a 33.3% ownership stake in a combination Dunkin’ brand/Baskin-Robbins brand joint venture, with South Korean shareholders owning the remaining 66.7% of the joint venture. The joint venture acts as the master franchisee for South Korea, sub-franchising the Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins brands to franchisees. The joint venture also manufactures and supplies restaurants located in South Korea with ice cream, donuts, and coffee products. 
Japan 
Restaurants in Japan accounted for approximately 19% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year 2018, 100% of which came from Baskin-Robbins. We conduct business in Japan through a 43.3% ownership stake in a Baskin-Robbins brand joint venture. Our partner also owns a 43.3% interest in the joint venture, with the remaining 13.4% owned by public shareholders. The joint venture primarily manufactures and sells ice cream to restaurants in Japan and acts as master franchisee for the country. 
- 5-

Middle East 
The Middle East represents another key region for us. Restaurants in the Middle East accounted for approximately 17% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year 2018. Baskin-Robbins accounted for approximately 61% of such sales. We conduct operations in the Middle East through master franchise arrangements. 
Industry overview 
According to The NPD Group/CREST® (“CREST®”), the QSR segment of the U.S. restaurant industry accounted for approximately $301 billion of the total $462 billion restaurant industry sales in the U.S. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The U.S. restaurant industry is generally categorized into segments by price point ranges, the types of food and beverages offered, and service available to consumers. QSR is a restaurant format characterized by counter or drive-thru ordering and limited, or no, table service. QSRs generally seek to capitalize on consumer desires for quality and convenient food at economical prices. 
Our Dunkin’ brand competes in the QSR segment categories and subcategories that include coffee, donuts, muffins, bagels, and breakfast sandwiches. In addition, in the U.S., our Dunkin’ brand has historically focused on the breakfast daypart, which we define to include the portion of each day from 5:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. While, according to CREST® data, the compound annual growth rate for total QSR daypart visits in the U.S. was 1% over the five-year period ended December 31, 2018, the compound annual growth rate for QSR visits in the U.S. during the morning meal daypart was 2% over the same five-year period. There can be no assurance that such growth rates will be sustained in the future. 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, there were sales of over 8 billion restaurant servings of coffee in the U.S., 88% of which were attributable to the QSR segment, according to CREST® data. According to CREST®, total coffee servings at QSR have grown at a 3% compound annual rate for the five-year period ending December 31, 2018. Over the years, our Dunkin’ brand has evolved into a predominantly coffee-based concept, with approximately 58% of Dunkin’ U.S. systemwide sales for fiscal year 2018 generated from coffee and other beverages. We believe QSRs, including Dunkin’, are positioned to capture additional coffee market share through an increased focus on coffee offerings.
Our Baskin-Robbins brand competes primarily in QSR segment categories and subcategories that include hard-serve ice cream as well as those that include soft serve ice cream, frozen yogurt, shakes, malts, floats, and cakes. While both of our brands compete internationally, approximately 68% of Baskin-Robbins restaurants are located outside of the U.S. and represent the majority of our total international sales and points of distribution.
Competition 
We compete primarily in the QSR segment of the restaurant industry and face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants, convenience stores, and other outlets that provide consumers with coffee, baked goods, sandwiches, and ice cream on an international, national, regional, and local level. We believe that we compete based on, among other things, product quality, restaurant concept, service, convenience, value perception, and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings, particularly during the breakfast daypart, and open new units. Although new competitors may emerge at any time due to the low barriers to entry, our competitors include: 7-Eleven, Burger King, Cold Stone Creamery, Cumberland Farms, Dairy Queen, McDonald’s, Panera Bread, Quick Trip, Starbucks, Subway, Taco Bell, Tim Hortons, WaWa, and Wendy’s, among others. Additionally, we compete with QSRs, specialty restaurants, and other retail concepts for prime restaurant locations and qualified franchisees. 
Licensing 
We derive licensing revenue from agreements with Dean Foods for domestic ice cream sales, with The J.M. Smucker Co. (“Smuckers”) for the sale of packaged coffee in certain retail outlets (primarily grocery retail), with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“KGM”) and Smuckers for sale of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods in certain retail outlets (primarily grocery retail), and with The Coca-Cola Company for the sale of Dunkin' branded ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee in certain retail outlets (primarily gas and convenience retail), as well as from other licensees. For the 52 weeks ending December 30, 2018, the Dunkin’ branded 12 oz. original blend coffee, which is distributed by Smuckers, was the #1 stock-keeping unit nationally in the premium coffee category. For the 52 weeks ending December 30, 2018, sales of our 12 oz. original blend, as expressed in total equivalent units and dollar sales, were double that of the next closest competitor. Additionally, for the 52 weeks ending December 30, 2018, the 10-count carton of our original blend K-Cup® pods, also distributed by Smuckers, was the #1 stock-keeping unit nationally in the K-Cup® pod category as expressed in total dollar sales. Through December 30, 2018, Dunkin' branded ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee sales in retail outlets have surpassed $300 million since launch in the first quarter of 2017. During calendar year 2018, more than 2.9 billion cups of Dunkin’ coffee were sold through licensing arrangements.

Marketing 
We coordinate domestic advertising and marketing at the national and local levels through our administration of brand specific advertising funds. The goals of our marketing strategy include driving comparable store sales and brand differentiation, increasing our total coffee and beverage sales, protecting and growing our morning daypart sales, and growing our afternoon daypart sales. Generally, our domestic franchisees contribute 5% of weekly gross retail sales to fund brand specific advertising funds. The funds are used for various national and local advertising campaigns including print, radio, television, online, mobile, loyalty, billboards, and sponsorships. Over the past ten years, our U.S. franchisees have invested approximately $2.8 billion on advertising to increase brand awareness and restaurant performance across both brands. Additionally, we have various pricing strategies, so that our products appeal to a broad range of customers. In August 2012, we launched the Dunkin’ mobile application for payment and gifting, which built the foundation for one-to-one marketing with our customers. In January 2014, we launched a new DD Perks® Rewards loyalty program nationally, which is fully integrated with the Dunkin’ mobile application and allows us to engage our customers in these one-to-one marketing interactions. In June 2016, we continued to leverage digital technologies to drive customer loyalty and enhance the restaurant experience through the launch of On-the-Go mobile ordering for our DD Perks® members, which enables users to order ahead and speed to the front of the line in restaurants. In April 2018, we signed a multi-year agreement with a mobile wallet provider to secure a perpetual license to the software used to build and operate the mobile ordering and payment platform for Dunkin’, providing us greater control over the technology that enables our mobile payments and On-the-Go mobile ordering through the Dunkin' mobile application. As of December 29, 2018 our DD Perks® Rewards loyalty program had approximately 9.8 million members.
The supply chain 
Domestic 
We do not typically supply products to our domestic franchisees. As a result, with the exception of licensing fees paid by Dean Foods on domestic ice cream sales, we do not typically derive revenues from product distribution. Our franchisees’ suppliers include Dean Foods, Rich Products Corp., The Coca-Cola Company, and KGM. In addition, our franchisees’ primary coffee roasters currently are Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Inc., Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., S&D Coffee, Inc., and Reily Foods Company, Inc., and their primary donut mix suppliers currently are Continental Mills and Pennant Ingredients Inc. We periodically review our relationships with licensees and approved suppliers and evaluate whether those relationships continue to be on competitive or advantageous terms for us and our franchisees. 
Purchasing 
Purchasing for the Dunkin’ brand is facilitated by National DCP, LLC (the “NDCP”), which is a Delaware limited liability company operated as a cooperative owned by its franchisee members. The NDCP is managed by a staff of supply chain professionals who report directly to the NDCP’s board of directors. The NDCP has approximately 1,700 employees including executive leadership, sourcing professionals, warehouse staff, and drivers. The NDCP board of directors has eight voting franchisee members, one NDCP non-voting member, and one independent non-voting member. In addition, our Vice President of Supply Chain is a voting member of the NDCP board. The NDCP engages in purchasing, warehousing, and distribution of food and supplies on behalf of participating restaurants and some international markets. The NDCP program provides franchisee members nationwide the benefits of scale while fostering consistent product quality across the Dunkin’ brand. We do not control the NDCP and have only limited contractual rights associated with managing that franchisee-owned purchasing and distribution cooperative.
Manufacturing of Dunkin’ bakery goods 
Centralized production is another element of our supply chain that is designed to support growth for the Dunkin’ brand. Centralized manufacturing locations (“CMLs”) are franchisee-owned and -operated facilities for the centralized production of donuts and bakery goods. The CMLs deliver freshly baked products to Dunkin’ restaurants on a daily basis and are designed to provide consistent quality products while simplifying restaurant-level operations. As of December 29, 2018, there were 74 CMLs (of varying size and capacity) in the U.S. CMLs are an important part of franchise economics, and are supportive of profit building initiatives as well as protecting brand quality standards and consistency. 
Certain of our Dunkin’ brand restaurants produce donuts and bakery goods on-site rather than sourcing from CMLs. Many of such restaurants, known as full producers, also supply other local Dunkin’ restaurants that do not have access to CMLs. In addition, in newer markets, Dunkin’ restaurants source donuts and bakery goods that are finished in restaurants. We believe that this “just baked on demand” donut manufacturing platform enables the Dunkin’ brand to more efficiently expand its restaurant base in newer markets where franchisees may not have access to a CML.

Baskin-Robbins ice cream 
We outsource the manufacturing and distribution of ice cream products for the domestic Baskin-Robbins brand franchisees to Dean Foods, which strengthens our relationships with franchisees and allows us to focus on our core franchising operations. 
International 
Dunkin’
International Dunkin’ franchisees are responsible for sourcing their own supplies, subject to compliance with our standards. Most also produce their own donuts following the Dunkin’ brand’s approved processes. Franchisees in some markets source donuts produced by a brand approved third party supplier. Franchisees are permitted to source coffee from a number of coffee roasters approved by the brand, as well as certain approved regional and local roasters. In certain countries, our international franchisees source virtually everything locally within their market while in others our international franchisees source most of their supplies from the NDCP. Where supplies are sourced locally, we help identify and approve those suppliers. In addition, we assist our international franchisees in identifying regional and global suppliers with the goal of leveraging the purchasing volume for pricing and product continuity advantages. 
Baskin-Robbins 
The Baskin-Robbins manufacturing network is comprised of 10 facilities, none of which are owned or operated by us, that supply our international markets with ice cream products. We utilize facilities owned by Dean Foods to produce ice cream products which we purchase and distribute to many of our international markets. Certain international franchisees rely on third-party-owned facilities to supply ice cream products to them, including facilities in Ireland and Canada. The Baskin-Robbins brand restaurants in India and Russia are supported by master franchisee-owned facilities in those respective countries while the restaurants in Japan and South Korea are supported by the joint venture-owned facilities located within each country. 
Research and development 
New product innovation is a critical component of our success. We believe the development of successful new products for each brand attracts new customers, increases comparable store sales, and allows franchisees to expand into other dayparts. New product research and development is located in a state-of-the-art facility at our headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts. The facility includes a sensory lab, a quality assurance lab, and a demonstration test kitchen. We rely on our internal culinary team, which uses consumer research, to develop and test new products. 
Operational support 
Substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing, legal, technology, human resources, and operations support functions are conducted from our global headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts. In the United States, our franchise operations for both brands are organized into regions, each of which is headed by a regional vice president and directors of operations supported by field personnel who interact directly with the franchisees. Our international businesses are organized by region and have dedicated marketing and restaurant operations support teams that work with our master licensees and joint venture partners to improve restaurant operations and restaurant-level economics. Management of a franchise restaurant is the responsibility of the franchisee, who is trained in our techniques and is responsible for ensuring that the day-to-day operations of the restaurant are in compliance with our operating standards. We have implemented a computer-based disaster recovery program to address the possibility that a natural (or other form of) disaster may impact the information technology systems located at our Canton, Massachusetts headquarters. 
Regulatory matters 
Domestic 
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including various health, sanitation, fire, and safety standards. In some jurisdictions our restaurants are required by law to display nutritional information about our products. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building, and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Franchisee-owned NDCP and CMLs are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal, state, and local governments. 
We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various other laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, and citizenship requirements. A significant number of food-service personnel employed by franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage.

Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rule and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the FDD with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our experience and aggregate net worth. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We believe that the FDD for each of our Dunkin’ brand and our Baskin-Robbins brand, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC franchise rule and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises. 
International 
Internationally, we and our franchisees are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting us and our franchisees in the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor, health, sanitation, and safety. International Baskin-Robbins brand and Dunkin’ brand restaurants are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment, and laws regulating foreign investment. We believe that the international disclosure statements, franchise offering documents, and franchising procedures for our Baskin-Robbins brand and Dunkin’ brand comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable countries. 
Environmental 
Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties we lease and sublease to our franchisees and any construction or improvements we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning, and land use requirements. Our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations, such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners. Environmental laws sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault. While we have been required to, and are continuing to, clean up contamination at a limited number of our locations, we have no known material environmental liabilities. 
Employees 
As of December 29, 2018, we employed 1,107 people, 1,066 of whom were based in the U.S. and 41 of whom were based in other countries. Of our domestic employees, 426 worked in the field and 640 worked at our corporate headquarters. Of these employees, 220, who are almost exclusively in marketing positions, were paid by certain of our advertising funds. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationships with our employees are healthy.
Our franchisees are independent business owners, so they and their employees are not included in our employee count. 
Intellectual property 
We own many registered trademarks and service marks (“Marks”) in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. We believe that our Dunkin’ and Baskin-Robbins names and logos, in particular, have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our Marks in the U.S. and selected international jurisdictions, monitor our Marks portfolio both internally and externally through external search agents and vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our Marks. We license the use of our registered Marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees’ and licensees’ activities with respect to the use of our Marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the Marks and an affirmative obligation on the franchisees to notify us upon learning of potential infringement. In addition, we maintain a limited patent portfolio in the U.S. for bakery and serving-related methods, designs, and articles of manufacture. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. Neither the patents nor the copyrighted works are material to the operation of our business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in certain of our products. Such licenses are not individually, or in the aggregate, material to our business. 
Seasonality 
Our revenues are subject to fluctuations based on seasonality, primarily with respect to Baskin-Robbins. The ice cream industry generally experiences an increase during the spring and summer months, whereas Dunkin’ hot beverage sales generally increase during the fall and winter months and iced beverage sales generally increase during the spring and summer months.
