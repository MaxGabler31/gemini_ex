ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
MDwerks, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MDwerks”, the “Company, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a public shell company seeking to create value for its shareholders by merging with another entity with experienced management and opportunities for growth in return for shares of our common stock.
 
No potential merger candidate has been identified at this time.
 
We do not propose to restrict our search for a business opportunity to any particular industry or geographical area and may, therefore, engage in essentially any business in any industry. We have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions, and other factors.
 
The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our management’s best business judgment.
 
Our activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business, and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.
 
History of the Company
 
We were organized and incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 22, 2003 under the name Western Exploration, Inc. as a resource exploration stage company. In November 2005, we ceased operations as a resource exploration company due to inadequate financing. On November 16, 2005, Western Exploration, Inc. engaged in a merger with MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. and MDwerks Acquisition Corp., a Florida corporation (‘‘Acquisition Corp.’’), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Exploration, Inc., with MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Western Exploration, Inc. Upon the closing of the Merger, we changed our corporate name from ‘‘Western Exploration, Inc.’’ to ‘‘MDwerks, Inc.’’ and succeeded to the business of MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. as our sole line of business under the direction of MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc.’s management.
 
MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. was originally formed under the name Global IP Communications, Inc., in October 2003, as a provider of telecommunications products and services. In April 2004, MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. decided to discontinue its telecommunications business and in December 2004, it decided to focus on a new line of business in the area of providing insurance claims transaction solutions and related services through investment in Xeni Systems. In late May 2005, the Xeni Companies and MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. determined that a holding company structure with MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. serving as a holding company and overseeing the business of the Xeni Companies provided certain strategic advantages to the Xeni Companies. In addition, it also provided the Xeni Companies with access to cash held by MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc. to continue to fund the business of the Xeni Companies. As a result, the Xeni Companies became wholly-owned subsidiaries of MDwerks Global Holdings, Inc., pursuant to share exchange agreements between MDwerks and each of the shareholders of the Xeni Companies.

After 5 years of research, development and testing with strategic and ‘‘name brand’’ resources, the designer of Xeni Systems’ products, MEDwerks, LLC, substantially completed the initial product development cycle for the products offered by Xeni Systems. In October of 2003, MEDwerks, LLC ceased operations, due to a lack of continuing operating capital. In October of 2004, substantially all of the assets of MEDwerks, LLC were acquired by Xeni Systems pursuant to a Contribution and Stockholders Agreement (the ‘‘Contribution Agreement’’) in exchange for MEDwerks, LLC receiving approximately a 67% equity interest in Xeni Systems. The purpose of the Contribution Agreement transaction was to launch and market the MDwerks System commercially, utilizing a growth oriented management team of seasoned professionals. Xeni Systems successfully obtained investment and financing of $450,000 and positioned the technology for demonstration and pre-commercial sale.
 
Xeni Financial was organized in February 2005, to finance providers seeking loans on receivables processed through Xeni Systems. Xeni Billing was organized in March 2005, to provide billing services to providers processing their claims through Xeni Systems. Today, these entities are no longer providing billing services but are being used in our digital pen technology business as opposed to the purpose for which they were organized.
 
On February 12, 2010, MDwerks, Inc. ceased all operations. Michael Gelmon was appointed as the Company’s sole officer and director on August 11, 2020. The Company is a development stage emerging growth company that seeks to become a multi-industry technology-based enterprise primarily through merger and acquisition of business assets.

The board has the authority to establish the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof.
 
Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors may issue preferred shares may be issued without further stockholder approval and for such purposes as the board deems in the best interest of our company including future stock splits and split-ups, stock dividends, equity financings and issuances for acquisitions and business combinations. In addition, such authorized but unissued common and preferred shares could be used by the board of directors for defensive purposes against a hostile takeover attempt, including (by way of example) the private placement of shares or the granting of options to purchase shares to persons or entities sympathetic to, or contractually bound to support, management. We have no such present arrangement or understanding with any person. Further, the common and preferred shares may be reserved for issuance upon exercise of stock purchase rights designed to deter hostile takeovers, commonly known as a ‘‘poison pill.’’
