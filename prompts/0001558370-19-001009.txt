     ITEM 1.               BUSINESS.
 Blue Apron creates incredible experiences. Founded in 2012, we are building a consumer lifestyle brand that symbolizes the emotional human connections that are formed through the cooking experiences we create. 
 Our core product is the meal experience we help our customers create.  These experiences extend from discovering new recipes, ingredients, and cooking techniques to preparing meals with families and loved ones to sharing photos and stories of culinary triumphs.  Central to these experiences are the original recipes we design and send along with fresh, seasonal ingredients directly to our customers.  We also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals, and we sell a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, and pantry items, which are tested and recommended by our culinary team. Our customers span ages, geographies, income brackets, and culinary expertise. They include recent college graduates, young couples, families, singles, and empty nesters. Our passionate community of home cooks tell us, through emails, phone calls, and social media, how much Blue Apron has changed their lives.
 Central to our operations, we have developed an integrated ecosystem that employs technology and expertise across many disciplines. Our supply-demand coordination activities––demand planning, recipe creation, recipe merchandising, fulfillment operations, and marketing––drive our end-to-end value chain. 
 Our Products
 Meals
 On our direct-to-consumer platform, we currently offer two meal plans: a 2-Serving Plan that serves two people, and a Family Plan that serves four people. For each plan, customers have the flexibility to choose any combination of the recipes offered each week. This includes any two or three recipes from eight selections on the 2-Serving Plan and any two, three, or four recipes from five selections on the Family Plan. Based on the number of Orders in 2018 per plan type, 81% of our meal Orders were for the 2‑Serving Plan and 19% were for the Family Plan. Our customers can plan their orders to complement their individual tastes and lifestyles.  Some customers prefer to let our recipe recommendation algorithm choose their recipes based on the food preferences they have provided to us, while other customers actively choose, several weeks in advance of delivery, which recipes to receive.  Customers can choose to receive orders each week, or less frequently if that better suits their schedules.  Customers can make their order selections on our website or through our mobile application.
 We recognize that many consumers seek to engage with the Blue Apron brand beyond our direct-to-consumer platform and have created products for retail and on-demand distribution channels. As we expand to new distribution channels beyond our direct-to-consumer platform, aligning our brand and culinary offerings with strategic partners is a critical component of our methodical channel expansion strategy.
 For all of our products, our culinary team, including chefs who are alumni of some of the best restaurants in the world, such as Michelin-starred Per Se and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, begins the recipe creation process with various seasonal ingredients grown by our farm suppliers. Our chefs apply to these raw ingredients their expertise and insights from our customer feedback and recipe ratings to create our recipe offerings, with an eye towards what is accessible for individuals and families to eat week-in and week-out.  
 We merchandise our recipes through various campaigns geared toward seasonality, taste preferences, ingredients, or health. Our approach to menu design seeks to balance ingredient supply and cost while appealing to a variety of customer lifestyles and cooking attitudes across a broad range of demographics and taste profiles. 
 On our direct-to-consumer platform, we offer at least nineteen recipes per week between our 2-Serving and Family Plans, striving for a balanced mix of ingredients, cuisines, familiarity, discovery, and preparation times. The meal solutions we create for retail and on-demand distribution channels vary, and are customized for a diverse set of lifestyle and taste preferences.

 The phrase “a great recipe is composed of incredible ingredients” is a core Blue Apron philosophy.  We are committed to sourcing fresh, high‑quality ingredients year round from our supplier network that includes farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and artisans.  Our recipes change every week based on the season and often feature specialty ingredients not readily available elsewhere.  By merchandising these ingredients into carefully crafted recipes, we are able to introduce our customers to ingredients they may have never experienced before. We also partner with artisan suppliers to create ingredients specifically for our recipes, such as custom sauces, unique spice blends, or bespoke ramen noodles from a third‑generation noodle maker.
 Our ingredient standards are critically important to us and our customers. We source only ingredients certified by our suppliers as non‑GMO (genetically modified organism) and buy certain ingredients from certified organic producers.  All of our beef, poultry, and pork comes from animals given exclusively vegetarian feed and not treated with added hormones or sub‑therapeutic antibiotics. Similarly, we source high‑quality seafood consistent with the standards established by Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch, one of the world’s most respected sustainable seafood organizations.
 Wine
 Blue Apron Wine, our direct-to-consumer wine delivery service, uses an integrated supply chain and direct sourcing relationships to deliver high‑quality wines at compelling values.  We work directly with vineyards and acclaimed winemakers to create custom Blue Apron wines that are specially crafted for our customers and are not available elsewhere.  Our wines pair with our meals and are sized for a dinner for two (in 500ml bottles, rather than traditional 750ml bottles). Customers have the flexibility to customize their box, choosing six bottles from a monthly selection of wines, that best meet their taste preferences. Our wine offerings include red and white wines (and rosés, depending on the season), tasting notes, pairing tips, and the story behind each wine. We are a licensed winery, and currently ship directly to customers in 31 states and Washington, D.C. Our customers can choose to purchase wine alone or to purchase both meals and wine. As with our meals, customers may choose to actively manage their wine orders by adjusting deliveries to fit their schedules, or they may simply sign up and receive a delivery each month. Market
 Blue Apron Market, our e-commerce marketplace, features a curated selection of cooking tools, utensils, and pantry items, which are tested and recommended by our culinary team.  Many of these items are not available elsewhere, and we have focused on expanding our exclusive items and partnerships. All of our recipe cards feature cooking tools and utensils from Blue Apron Market, creating an integrated brand experience for our community of home cooks and repeated merchandising opportunities for our company. Digital Experience 
 Customers can find recipes, register their preferences, manage their accounts, and make purchases on our site or on our iOS and Android mobile applications. Our digital customer experience is immersive: we offer how-to cooking videos, stories about our suppliers, and our collection of thousands of recipes that customers can access on their own. How We Do It
 We have created an integrated ecosystem that enables us to source high‑quality, differentiated ingredients, design original recipes around those ingredients, and combine them into meaningful cooking experiences that we deliver to customers across the United States.  Our interconnected end‑to‑end value chain allows us to execute cost‑effectively and at scale.  Coordination between our culinary team, marketing practices, and technology tools helps us pair customer demand with supply, as well as to work with our suppliers to deliver high‑quality food at compelling values.  Our fulfillment and logistics operations are built to support our ongoing product innovation.

 Supply‑Demand Coordination 
 Our supply‑demand coordination activities include demand planning, recipe creation, recipe merchandising, and marketing.  We use near‑term and long‑term demand forecasting based on proprietary data and software to inform decisions along our value chain, from decisions about fulfillment center capacity to predicting our supply needs to ingredient purchasing.  This process continues through recipe creation and merchandising, as we craft recipes around available ingredients, and have the ability to make adjustments up to just a few weeks prior to fulfillment.  We have also tailored our marketing strategies based on these demand forecasts and planning to optimize our marketing return‑on‑investment.
 Supplier Partnerships
 Our deep supplier relationships, built on a foundation of trust, provide us access to a supply of high‑quality ingredients and enable us to reduce costs and enhance utilization of natural resources.  Current strategies we employ with some of our suppliers to support this approach include working directly with farmers, ranchers, and fishermen to provide fresh, sustainably sourced ingredients to our customers at a compelling value and collaborating with farmers and ranchers on meat and poultry that meets our animal welfare standards. This collaboration enables us to provide premium, humanely raised products to our customers, such as grass-fed beef and pasture-raised poultry.  Operations
 Our purchasing, production, fulfillment, and logistics operations are integrated with our demand management and supplier relationships.  Successfully integrating these disparate activities requires us to possess a variety of competencies: a team with deep, ingredient‑specific relationships; a technology‑enabled platform that connects our end‑to‑end operations; and a scalable architecture that adapts to surges in demand as well as variations in available supply. Our enhanced planning and process-driven strategies enable us to make informed purchasing decisions and provide opportunities to better manage food costs and allocate labor in our fulfillment centers. Informed Purchasing
 While we work directly with our suppliers months in advance to plan our supply needs, we place purchase orders closer to the expected fulfillment, after coordinating supply and demand through processes such as recipe merchandizing and analyzing the outputs of our demand planning tools. Production and Fulfillment
 Our fulfillment centers are designed to effectively manage our variable, high‑throughput, perishable inventory as well as flexible production and labor needs.  We have invested extensively in our fulfillment centers, including by launching our Linden, New Jersey center in 2017 and implementing automation equipment in each of our fulfillment centers, and continue to optimize our network with a focus on maximizing efficiencies.
 Because we prep and ship perishable products, our fulfillment centers must adhere to stringent food and safety standards, temperature protocols, and regulatory guidelines.  We also station quality managers from our culinary team, many of whom are former professional chefs, in our fulfillment centers to ensure that our ingredients adhere to our quality standards.  Each fulfillment center is certified under the Safe Quality Food (SQF) Food Safety Code for Manufacturing nationwide, a globally recognized, independent food safety standard administered by the Safe Quality Food Institute. 
 To support our fulfillment operations, we have developed proprietary technology for every step of the process, from using our proprietary inventory management tools to assess incoming ingredients for quality to a proprietary kitchen prep software that demonstrates to fulfillment associates how to prep ingredients for each recipe, and provides instructions on selecting the correct type of packaging for each ingredient.

 Logistics
 Our logistics team designs, manages, and optimizes a ground‑based delivery network comprised of several third party partners capable of delivering to geographies covering over 99% of the U.S. population.  We analyze outbound logistics on a zip code by zip code basis to enable cost‑effective and timely delivery of orders, while also adjusting the packaging of our ingredients and other components of our fulfillment operations based on the expected delivery route, weather, or ultimate destination.  All of our packaging materials are chosen with environmental impact in mind.  We select packaging that is recyclable or biodegradable whenever possible.  Our packaging innovation team, with the support of third party sustainability experts, is focused on innovating to improve our packaging design, lower overall costs, and reduce our carbon footprint.  Our Brand and Marketing
 We are building a consumer lifestyle brand that inspires, connects, and brings memorable experiences to homes across the country. Several nights a week, our customers invite us into their homes. We take part in some of the most joyful parts of their days, helping them create a meal for their families and loved ones. Their challenges are opportunities for us to learn together, and their accomplishments are among our proudest achievements. We hear their success stories every day. Unlike a purely transactional e-commerce platform, we believe the emotional connection that customers have with our brand will enable us to have a more meaningful role in their lives. 
 We believe in utilizing a strategic mix of marketing channels to efficiently add new customers as well as to engage and create value for our existing customers. This includes a diverse mix of online and offline channels, as well as strategic partnerships that enable us to expand our brand to new segments of customers. We deliberately focus on the marketing channels we believe to be the most efficient and on customer segments that have demonstrated stronger affinity and retention. We believe our customers continue to be some of our best marketers, and we see them share their Blue Apron moments through social media, blogs, and referrals. We also have a customer referral program through which certain existing customers may invite others to receive a complimentary meal delivery.
 For all of our products, we use a combination of paid, earned, and owned media to increase the awareness of our brand and attract new customers. Our content enables customers to connect and interact with our brand even when they are not cooking with us.  For example, we leverage both our digital channels and printed content within deliveries to highlight specific ingredients, provide general cooking tips and techniques and foster conversation within our community of home cooks.
 Finally, strategic brand partnerships are an important opportunity for us to leverage the platform we are building to add value for our existing customers and showcase our brand to new customer segments. 
 Our Customers
 Our customers represent a broad range of demographics including a wide range of age groups and incomes.  Customers of all kinds are able to successfully incorporate Blue Apron into a wide variety of lifestyles.

 Our Market Opportunity
 Our market opportunity is broad, as we believe the quality of our product, the meaningful experiences we create, and the deep, emotional connection we have built with our customers positions us well in the dynamic and high-profile category in which we operate. 
 The annual U.S. grocery market and annual U.S. restaurant market each account for hundreds of billions of dollars of sales. We expect online sales in these markets to grow significantly in the coming years and think that an opportunity exists to meaningfully increase online grocery and online restaurant penetration, while leveraging the strength of our brand to expand into more diverse channels.  
 We believe that shifts in consumer preferences, such as a growing interest in home cooking and an increasing number of customers who prioritize experiences over goods, position us well to participate in these dynamic markets in a meaningful way. 
 Our Competition
 The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we face an array of competitors from many different industry sectors. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) other food and meal delivery companies; (2) the supermarket industry; (3) a wide array of food retailers, including natural and organic, specialty, conventional, mass, discount, and other food retail formats; (4) conventional supermarkets; (5) other food retailers; (6) online supermarket retailers; (7) casual dining and quick‑service restaurants and other food service businesses in the restaurant industry; (8) online wine retailers, wine specialty stores, and retail liquor stores; and (9) food manufacturers, consumer packaged goods companies, providers of logistics services, and other food and ingredient producers.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors upon which we compete include: brand, reputation, and customer satisfaction; price; product quality, and safety; value perception; convenience; customer service; reliable and timely fulfillment; and variety, quality, and flexibility of product offering.

  Employees
 As of January 31, 2019, we had 2,343 full‑time employees, of which approximately 72% were engaged in fulfillment operations.  None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Intellectual Property
 Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology and our customer data, will be an important factor in our strategy and the success of our business.  We seek to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, and other intellectual property protections under applicable law. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad.  We also seek to protect and avoid disclosure of our intellectual property through confidentiality, non‑disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and through appropriate agreements with our suppliers and others.  We have filed three patent applications related to product packaging. Government Regulation
 Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulatory requirements, including regulation of our food and wine operations.
 Government Regulation of Foods and Food Companies
 Food companies, such as Blue Apron, are subject to extensive government regulation.  Federal statutes applicable to food production include, for example, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act.  Federal regulators have promulgated extensive regulatory 

 
  10

 
schemes to implement these and other relevant statutes.  These evolving regulatory structures govern matters including manufacturing, formulating, labeling, advertising, packaging, storing, and implementing safety measures for our food products.  Legal changes and uncertainty regarding the regulation of food products have accelerated in recent years.  In particular, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has been implementing the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act by promulgating substantial numbers of new regulations and introducing multiple versions of non‑binding, draft guidance documents suggesting new compliance measures for the food industry.  Understanding within the food industry of how to apply these regulations and the suggestions offered in FDA guidance documents continues to evolve.
 State and local jurisdictions also regulate U.S. food manufacturing facilities.  For example, we currently produce and fulfill products in the states of California, New Jersey, and Texas.  State and local governments exert regulatory authority over our operations in these jurisdictions.  The states and localities in which a food production facility is located can impose registration, licensing, and inspection requirements in addition to those imposed by federal law.  Some also enforce significant consumer protection‑focused statutory schemes, which can impose additional costs and complexity on food producers.
 Food companies in the U.S. are subject to government inspection with or without notice at any time, with concomitant responsibility to provide access to facilities and equipment, produce extensive operational documentation, and furnish product, packaging, and labeling samples for governmental examination.  Federal, state, and local governmental agencies enjoy extensive discretion to determine whether, when and how to conduct these activities.  Food companies are therefore vulnerable to unexpected business interruptions and publicity.
 All food companies in the United States bear legal responsibility for any violation of applicable food regulatory law, whether that violation is negligent, non‑negligent, or deliberate.  Any U.S. company found to have violated food regulatory laws may have its products seized, its operations enjoined, its goods recalled from the market and destroyed, and its business exposed to significant adverse publicity.  It is also possible that new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing requirements, might require us to change our compliance policies, incur additional cost, or result in unexpected liabilities that could be significant.
 Food Safety and Quality Assurance
 We maintain a food safety and quality program to verify that the food products supplied to our customers are processed in a safe and sanitary environment and are in compliance with regulatory requirements and our internal food quality and safety standards.  All meat and poultry products that we source are processed in facilities inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or by the equivalent agencies in countries deemed eligible by USDA for exporting meat and poultry to the United States.  Accordingly, these products must conform to USDA requirements.  All food and packaging suppliers are prequalified and have agreed to comply with our requirements.  While we perform supplier inspections and conduct product audits to evaluate suppliers and products for compliance with our company standards and specifications, we may not be able to prevent individual suppliers from failing to comply with food safety laws or our requirements, and we may not be able to locate each failure to comply with food safety laws or our requirements prior to shipments of food products.  We operate a toll free, customer call center to capture and address telephonic and electronic customer complaints, including complaints about the quality of our food products. Government Regulation of Our Wine Business
 The production, sale, and shipment of wine in the United States are each regulated by the federal government and by each state government.  There is not uniformity among state laws, so business models that are national in scope must account for the state‑by‑state rules to achieve compliance.
 Our wholly‑owned subsidiary BAW, Inc., or BAW, is a licensed California winery, and must comply with federal and California law controlling winery operations.  Various regulations control production, excise tax, labeling, alcohol content and recordkeeping.  In addition, the promotion and marketing of wine, including pricing, is sometimes regulated by federal or state regulations.  For example, wine marketing cannot be targeted to children, and some states restrict excessive discounts on wine. To assist with federal and state regulatory compliance, BAW relies on various internal and external personnel with relevant experience.

 Alcohol distribution in the United States is traditionally conducted through a “three‑tier” system, in which alcohol passes from manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer in each state, before it can be sold to a consumer.  However, applicable regulations permit manufacturers to ship wine directly to consumers around the country.  As a licensed California winery, BAW relies on such exceptions to sell and ship wine to the residents of 31 states plus the District of Columbia.  Each state permit held by BAW has specific compliance requirements, such as monthly reporting, limits on the amount of wine that can be shipped to a given household, and obtaining an adult signature on delivery.
