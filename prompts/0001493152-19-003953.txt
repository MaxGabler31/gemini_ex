Overview of the Business
 
The Company commenced jewelry sales on November 2018 and started to generate revenue at that time. The Company was formed as a US corporation to use as a vehicle for raising equity both in the United States and abroad.
 
JS Beauty Land Network Technology, Inc. (also referred to as “the Company”) is a Chinese retailer and wholesaler of jade stone-adorned jewelry and decorations. The Company intends to directly engage in the manufacture, marketing and sales of fine jewelry and art from China through its newly formed Chinese subsidiary, Jiangsu Meiyunmei Technology Inc. (“MYM”). The Company commenced retail sales operations in November 2018. We are unaware of any specific restrictions imposed by the Government of China with respect to the conduct of the business of the Company or its Chinese subsidiary. The Company intends to utilize a business model that would focus on repeat clientele and collectors. In addition to its core business, the Company intends to offer memberships to its customers estimated to cost approximately $1,500, which will offer exclusive purchase opportunities. The Company’s activities will range from procuring high-quality stones, to building cooperative partnerships with its customers. The Company’s Chinese headquarters are in Xuanwu, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Jade remains a unique, sentimental, high-end gemstone in China, with export revenues of approximately $23,000,000 in the first quarter of 2018. While the Chinese market is keen on translucency and color, the western market is keen on artistry, carving details, and especially originality. During the previous fiscal year (2016-2017), Myanmar exported over 11,000 tons of raw jade, worth approximately $250,000,000 to neighboring markets, especially China. The total export value of mineral products from China, including jade, was approximately $865,000,000 in the last fiscal year. The foregoing statistics are based solely on management’s opinion or belief.
Marketing and Distribution
 
Marketing will be done through a variety of channels, including the Internet, networking, trade shows, social media, and influencer marketing. In addition, print advertising will target carefully chosen audiences. The distribution channels will be retail branch locations and online through the We Chat platform.
Target Market
 
JS Beauty Land Network Technology, Inc. anticipates that the primary customers of its products and services will be:
 

● | Men between 30 and 44 Years - Management believes that this market has a high interest in the purchase of high-end jade jewelry.

The Jade and Jadeite Market in China
 
Jadeite is the purest form of the stone, an almost translucent substance that comes in a multitude of colors, from deep greens to lavender, white, and black. It is the hardest and most valuable form of the stone and most often turned into jewelry. Nephrite is a lesser quality jade that also comes in an array of colors. Because of its cloudy nature, it is mostly used for carvings. Jade is highly sensitive and most expensive in its purest form. Any alteration or treatment significantly reduces its value. Chinese demand for high-quality jadeite continues to grow from wealthy and middle-class citizens. This, coupled with the dwindling raw jade stocks in Myanmar, which supplies the vast majority of the world’s jade and is the only source of high-quality stone, has contributed to rising jadeite prices in China. There is growing emphasis on quality factors like color and translucency from collectors, which is driving the demand for jadeite, among other jade products. Jade is regarded as a high end, unique and sentimental product, with Chinese clients keen on translucency and color. Western buyers are keener on artistry, carving details, and, especially, originality.
Potential Acquisitions
 
As an adjunct to its business strategy, the Company will also seek to identify potential acquisitions which are involved in the operation of jewelry manufacturing facilities and jewelry retailers in China, particularly those dealing in fine emerald and jade jewelry.
Company Funding
 
To date, all funding has been provided on a loan basis. At December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of such loans was $140,114, of which $73,900 was payable to related parties. These loans are non-interest bearing and payable on demand. To date, these advances are not the subject of any written agreements, however, if not repaid in the short term, the Company may enter into formal loan agreements with respect to these obligations in the future. The Company expects that these advances will be repaid from equity raised in China. In addition, the Company has accrued liabilities to certain vendors who have provided services to the Company aggregating $14,546. This funding has been utilized to fund the formation of the Company and legal and accounting services incurred in connection with the Company becoming a US reporting company.
 
The Company intends to undertake to raise approximately $5,000,000 in new investment, exclusively from investors located in China. In this regard, the Company intends to primarily offer equity investment in the form of common stock or convertible debt. The Company believes that these funds can be raised within a 12-month period, but there is no guarantee that this will occur. These funds would be used for general corporate purposes and to expand sales channels in China and internationally.

Emerging Growth Company Status Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act
 
Because we generated less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act.
 
We will lose our emerging growth company status on the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
 
1. On the last day of any fiscal year in which we earn at least $1 billion in total annual gross revenues, which amount is adjusted for inflation every five years;
 
2. On the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement;
 
3. On the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non- convertible debt; or
 
4. On the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer”, as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor thereto. A “large accelerated filer” is an issuer that, at the end of its fiscal year, meets the following conditions:
 
a. It has an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by its non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of the issuer’s most recently completed second fiscal quarter;
 
b. It has been subject to the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Act for a period of at least twelve calendar months; and

As an emerging growth company, exemptions from the following provisions are available to us:
 
1. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires auditor attestation of internal controls;
 
2. Section 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which require companies to hold shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
3. Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the company;
 
4. Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act (which has not yet been implemented), which requires companies to disclose the ratio between the annual total compensation of the CEO and the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the companies; and
 
5. The requirement to provide certain other executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Instead, an emerging growth company must only comply with the more limited provisions of Item 402 applicable to smaller reporting companies, regardless of the issuer’s size.
 
Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is not an emerging growth company. We have elected to maintain our status as an emerging growth company and take advantage of the JOBS Act provisions.
 
Competition
 
The Company encounters substantial competition from a wide variety of entities in both of its business lines, most of which is from companies which are better capitalized than the Company. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had one full time employee.
