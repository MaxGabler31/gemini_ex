Lighthouse Customers 
Our market-entry strategy has been to establish high-value customer engagements with large global early adopters, or lighthouse customers, in Europe, Asia, and the United States across a range of industries. These lighthouse customers serve as proof points for other potential customers in their particular industries. We have established intimate strategic relationships with our customers, including a number of large multinational corporations and government entities. We commonly enter into enterprise-wide agreements with entities that include multiple operating units or divisions.
The core of this strategy is to rapidly deliver high-value outcomes at large scale, that are broadly deployed into many industry leaders, including those in banking, oil and gas, utilities, defense, and manufacturing. We then use these cases and outcomes to initiate discussions at numerous leading companies in each sector.
High-Value Outcomes 
We are enabling the digital transformation of many of the world’s leading organizations and, in the process, helping them to attain short time-to-value and exceptionally high economic returns. At some companies, based on feedback and other information provided from our customers, we estimate our solutions have returned hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefit. We estimate, based on our C3 AI production roadmaps, that we may enable billions of dollars in annual economic benefit for many customers.
Rapid Time to Value 
The key to our market success to date and our primary competitive differentiator is our ability to leverage the C3 AI Application Platform and C3 AI Applications to bring high-value Enterprise AI applications into production use rapidly. We have deployed Enterprise AI applications into production use in as little as four weeks. Most C3 AI customers enjoy a rapid time to value from their investments in our offerings.
C3 AI Sales Cycle 
Our typical sales cycle begins with one or more product and technical presentations about C3 AI, leading to a mapping of our capabilities to customer use cases. This frequently leads to a paid trial that lasts from eight to 16 weeks. During that period, we deploy a production-level application that is representative of our customer’s Enterprise AI and digital transformation requirements. After completing a successful trial, our customers will frequently license one or more C3 AI Applications. Either concurrent with or subsequent to licensing C3 AI Applications, some of our customers will license additional C3 AI Applications or the C3 AI Application Platform. Over time, our customers tend to purchase additional C3 AI Applications and/ or additional C3 AI Application Platform developer seats and incur ongoing and increasing runtime fees as their usage scales.
Extensive Partner Ecosystem
We have established strategic relationships with technology leaders including Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Baker Hughes, ENGIE, Fidelity National Information Services, or FIS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and Raytheon. These world-leading companies can marshal tens of thousands of talented resources to establish and serve small, medium, and large C3 AI customer relationships at global scale. 
We form go-to-market and product co-development alliances with our partners that combine our Enterprise AI expertise and technology with our partners’ deep domain expertise to bring next-generation C3 AI solutions to joint customers. Our partnerships include strategic alliances across four categories:
•Industry Partners. Each industry partnership focuses on a key vertical. We have formed global strategic alliances in the energy industry with France-based global energy leader ENGIE; in oil and gas with Baker Hughes, a global leader in oilfield services; in financial services with FIS, a leading technology provider to the global financial services industry; and in the U.S. Federal and aerospace sectors with Raytheon, one of the world’s largest aerospace and defense manufacturers.
•Hyperscale Cloud and Infrastructure Partners. We have formed global strategic go-to-market alliances with hyperscale cloud providers including AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. In addition, we have strategic alliances with leading hardware infrastructure providers to deliver our software optimized for their technology such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Intel.
•Consulting and Services. We have established partnerships with select specialized systems integrators that provide application design and development, data engineering, data science, and systems integration services, including: Aubay, BGP, Grupo CMC, Data Reply, Infoedge Technology, Informatica El Corte Ingles, Intelia, Ortec, and Pariveda. These alliances are focused on helping organizations accelerate their Enterprise AI and digital transformation programs.
•Independent Software Vendors. Our Independent Software Vendors, or ISV, partners develop, market, and sell application solutions that are natively built on or tightly integrated with the C3 AI Application Platform. The C3 AI Application Platform enables ISVs to deliver Enterprise AI capabilities to their installed user base that enhance or complement existing ISV application functionality. As of April 2022, ISV partners include ENGIE, FIS, Baker Hughes, Microsoft, and Ortec.
Sales Model
Our sales organization is organized both geographically and into vertical market segments that cooperate to sell to and service customers. We have a highly leveraged go-to-market model comprised of a global field sales force combined with significant alliance partnerships, that we believe will accelerate our entry into diverse global market segments. Each of our strategic partners—including AWS, Baker Hughes, ENGIE, FIS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and Raytheon—has a large installed customer base with strong, established relationships, and a large global sales force that vastly extends our market coverage. We form specific sales targets and goals with each partner, enabling us to quickly and efficiently engage in customer accounts.
Historically, our strategy has been to achieve early leadership with a focus on large enterprise sales to establish successful lighthouse customers across a range of industries and geographies. We initially focused on the oil and gas, aerospace, defense, utilities, manufacturing, and financial services sectors, as those industries were early adopters in Enterprise AI. We intend to expand into additional industries such as high technology, telecommunications, retail, and precision medicine and expect to continue our market entry strategy of initially focusing on lighthouse customers in these industries. Our goal is to rapidly move down-market in the next few years to capture the small and medium business segments of each industry. We intend to leverage our partner ecosystem and establish telesales and direct marketing organizations to address the middle market.
Our average sales cycles have been decreasing over time. We believe this is due to increased acceptance of cloud adoption, increased prioritization of Enterprise AI, increasing corporate mandates for digital transformation, increased brand recognition of C3 AI, and increasing numbers of live, production C3 AI customers.
Revenue Model
Our revenue consists of subscription and professional services revenue. The bulk of our revenue is generated from subscriptions to our software. Our subscriptions include our software and our maintenance and support services. Our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable, and typically three years in duration. We also generate additional runtime subscription fees, a type of consumption or usage-based revenue based on compute and storage resources required to run the C3 AI Application Platform. Our professional services primarily includes implementation services, training and prioritized engineering services.
Marketing
Our multichannel marketing function is focused on market education, brand awareness, thought leadership, account-based marketing, and demand creation. We engage the market through digital, radio, television, outdoor, airport, social media and print advertising; virtual and physical events, including our C3 AI Transform annual customer conference; and livestreamed events featuring C3 AI customers, C3 AI partners, and C3 AI experts in AI, machine learning, and data science. Our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Siebel—a recognized technology thought leader and author of the 2019 Wall Street Journal and Amazon best seller, Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction—is a frequent industry keynote speaker and is often interviewed by leading media, including the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Economist, Fortune, Forbes, BloombergTV, and Yahoo! Finance.

C3 AI Academy provides a role-based, in-person, and online curriculum to help developers, data scientists, administrators, and project personnel take advantage of the C3 AI Application Platform capabilities quickly and robustly.
Our professional services strategy is to quickly train our customers to develop, customize, and deploy applications independently of us, making them rapidly self-sufficient. In those instances where a large or continuing professional services presence may be desired or necessary, we rely upon our partner ecosystem to provide those services. We believe this will enable us to maintain high gross margins and allow us to rapidly deploy trained professional services personnel at large scale any place on the planet.
Rich Human Capital
Our strongest asset is unquestionably the human capital that we have been able to attract, retain, and motivate. We have won the Glassdoor Best Place to Work award, were named a Battery Ventures/Glassdoor Highest-Rated Cloud Companies To Work For, and are consistently ranked among the best places to work.

C3 AI is also one of the 25 Highest-Rated Cloud Companies to Work For by Battery Ventures/Glassdoor (2021).
Sustainable Competitive Advantage: C3 AI Model-Driven Architecture
Our core technology is a cohesive family of integrated software services developed over a decade, engineered with a proprietary model-driven architecture, that provides all the software services and microservices necessary and sufficient to rapidly develop and deploy Enterprise AI applications. 
AI applications developed with the C3 AI Application Platform can leverage any open source software solutions and all of the cloud services of AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and can operate on any of these cloud platforms, on-premises, or in a hybrid cloud. 
Compared to the structured programming approach that most organizations typically attempt, our model-driven architecture with declarative programming speeds development by a factor of 26, while reducing the amount of code that must be written by up to 99%. 
The big data and application demands of enterprise-scale AI applications require numerous underlying interdependent elements. These include enterprise data, extraprise data, sensor data, data persistence services, data streaming services, messaging services, analytics services, machine-learning services, security services, data visualization, application development services, application monitoring services, and scores to hundreds more. With a traditional structured programming approach, developers spend significant time and effort to write extensive code to define, manage, connect, and control each element. This often results in overwhelming complexity and highly brittle applications that can break any time an underlying element is changed or updated— we believe this is a primary reason why the vast majority of AI efforts have not been deployed into production at enterprise scale.
By contrast, our model-driven architecture provides an “abstraction layer,” that allows our partners and our customers, as well as our internal C3 AI developers, to build or customize Enterprise AI applications by using conceptual models of all the elements an application requires, instead of writing lengthy code. C3 AI provides a library of tens of thousands of prebuilt conceptual models, growing by more than 4,000 per year, that can be easily modified and extended, and developers can efficiently create their own models as well. These prebuilt, extensible models encompass a vast range of business objects (customer, order, contract, etc.), physical systems and subsystems (engine, boiler, chiller, compressor, etc.), computing resources and services (database, stream processing, etc.)—virtually anything an application requires can be represented as a model in our model-driven architecture. To ensure ongoing operability of our thousands of prebuilt and extensible models on different underlying infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure, etc.), our automated testing continuously executes approximately 60,000 tests and security scans with each change or update we make to our software or infrastructure. 
Leveraging this model-driven architecture, application developers and data scientists can focus on delivering immediate value, without the need to manage the complex interdependencies of the underlying elements. These conceptual models can be reused by many applications, thereby accelerating development of new applications. 
Compared to traditional structured programming, our model-driven architecture and declarative programming shorten time to value and reduce total cost of ownership by:
•Enabling developers to build Enterprise AI applications 26 times faster and with up to 99% less code than with other technologies, by using conceptual models (including tens of thousands of C3 AI’s prebuilt models).
•Reducing the resources required to build Enterprise AI applications.
•Making developers more productive by allowing them to ramp quickly on new application projects, through reuse of models across applications and reduced coding requirements.
•Decreasing application operating and maintenance requirements.
•Accelerating the ability to enhance applications with new features.
We believe our model-driven architecture and declarative programming approach provides significant competitive advantage both by enabling our customers and partners to successfully develop and deploy Enterprise AI applications faster, and by providing the foundation for C3 AI to rapidly extend our portfolio of cross-industry and industry-specific applications.
Strategic Competitive IP Advantage
We enjoy a rich patent portfolio that is a substantial competitive advantage, both offensive and defensive, in the Enterprise AI market—most notably, U.S. patents (No. 10,817,530 and No. 10,824,634) which were granted for systems, methods, and devices for an enterprise AI and internet-of-things platform.
Our patent portfolio covers the key capabilities of our model-driven architecture that are the foundation of our highly differentiated technology. This includes methods, systems, and devices for data aggregation and unification, times-series data processing, data abstraction, machine learning implementation, and much more. 
As of April 30, 2022, our technology is protected by a broad patent portfolio, with 12 issued patents in the United States, 10 issued counterpart patents in a number of international jurisdictions, over 30 patent applications pending in the United States, and over 50 patent applications pending internationally. Our issued patents expire beginning in 2033 through 2039. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
Intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property. 
Our Secret Sauce: The C3 AI Model-Driven Architecture
Over the last four decades, the information technology industry has grown from about $120 billion globally in 1980 to more than $3.0 trillion today. During this time, the IT industry has experienced the transition from mainframe computing to minicomputers, to personal computing, to internet computing, and to handheld computing. The software industry has transitioned from custom applications based on mainframe standards such as MVS, VSAM, and ISAM, to applications developed on a relational database foundation, to enterprise application software, to SaaS and mobile apps, and now to the AI-enabled enterprise. The internet and the iPhone changed everything.
Each of these transitions represented a replacement market for its predecessor. Each delivered dramatic benefits in productivity. Each offered organizations the opportunity to gain competitive advantage. Companies that failed to take advantage of each new generation of technology ceased to be competitive. Today it is unimaginable that a major global corporation would try to close its books without an enterprise resource planning system or run its business solely on mainframe computers.
The IT industry is now undergoing another major transition. A new generation of 21st century technologies—including elastic cloud computing, the IoT, and AI—is driving digital transformation across industry, commerce, and government globally. Digital transformation presents a number of unique requirements that create the need for an entirely new software technology stack. The requirements are daunting.
Enterprise AI applications require a new digital transformation software stack. The traditional approach to developing AI and IoT enterprise software—i.e., using structured programming to build applications by assembling and integrating various open source components and cloud services—can be slow, costly, and ineffective. Based on experience and expertise, we believe that enterprise-scale AI and IoT applications generally share a set of demanding requirements as described in greater detail below.
Requirements of the Model-Driven Architecture
To develop an effective Enterprise AI application, it is necessary to aggregate data from a variety of enterprise information systems, suppliers, distributors, markets, products in customer use, and sensor networks, in order to provide a view of the extended enterprise.
Today’s data velocities are dramatic, requiring the ability to ingest and aggregate data from hundreds of millions of endpoints at very high frequency, sometimes exceeding 1,000 Hz cycles. The data need to be processed at the rate they arrive, in a highly secure and resilient system that addresses persistence, event processing, machine learning, and visualization. This requires massively horizontally scalable elastic distributed processing capability offered only by modern cloud platforms and supercomputer systems.
The resultant data persistence requirements are staggering. These data sets rapidly aggregate into hundreds of petabytes, even exabytes. Each data type needs to be stored in an appropriate database capable of handling these volumes at high frequency. Relational databases, key-value stores, graph databases, distributed file systems, and blobs are all important to organizing and linking data across these divergent technologies.
Reference Enterprise AI Software Platform
The problems that have to be addressed to enable today’s Enterprise AI and IoT applications are nontrivial. Massively parallel elastic computing and storage capacity are prerequisite. These services are provided today at increasingly low cost by AWS, Microsoft Azure, and others. The elastic cloud is a major breakthrough that has dramatically transformed modern computing. In addition to the cloud, multiple data services are necessary to develop, provision, and operate Enterprise AI and IoT applications.
The array of capabilities and services necessary for building and operating Enterprise AI and IoT applications at scale represents a development problem on the order of magnitude of a relatively simple enterprise software application such as CRM. This is not a trivial problem. Consider just a few of these requirements. 
•Data Integration. This problem has haunted the computing industry for decades. Prerequisite to machine learning and AI at industrial scale is the availability of a unified, federated image of all the data contained in the multitude of (1) enterprise information systems—ERP, CRM, SCADA, HR, MRP—typically thousands of systems in each large enterprise; (2) sensor IoT networks—SIM chips, smart meters, programmable logic arrays, machine telemetry, bioinformatics; and (3) relevant extraprise data—weather, terrain, satellite imagery, social media, biometrics, trade data, pricing, market data, etc.
•Data Persistence. The data aggregated and processed includes every type of structured and unstructured data imaginable. Personally identifiable information, census data, images, text, video, telemetry, voice, network topologies. There is no “one size fits all” database that is optimized for all of these data types. This results in the need for a multiplicity of database technologies including but not limited to relational, NoSQL, key-value stores, distributed file systems, graph databases, and blobs.
•Platform Services. A myriad of sophisticated platform services are necessary for any Enterprise AI or IoT application. Examples include access control, data encryption in motion, encryption at rest, ETL, queuing, pipeline management, autoscaling, multitenancy, authentication, authorization, cybersecurity, time-series services, normalization, data privacy, GDPR privacy compliance, NERC-CIP compliance, and SOC2 compliance.
•Analytics Processing. The volumes and velocity of data acquisition in such systems are blinding and the types of data and analytics requirements are highly divergent, requiring a range of analytics processing services. These include continuous analytics processing, MapReduce, batch processing, stream processing, and recursive processing.
•Machine Learning Services. The whole point of these systems is to enable data scientists to develop and deploy machine learning models. There is a range of tools necessary to enable that, including Jupyter Notebooks, Python, DIGITS, R, and Scala. Increasingly important is an extensible curation of machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Caffe, Torch, Amazon Machine Learning, and AzureML. An effective AI and IoT platform needs to support them all.
•Data Visualization Tools. Any viable AI architecture needs to enable a rich and varied set of data visualization tools including Excel, Tableau, Qlik, Spotfire, Oracle BI, Business Objects, Domo, Alteryx, and others.
•Developer Tools and UI Frameworks. An organization’s IT development and data science teams each have adopted and become comfortable with a set of application development frameworks and user interface development tools. An AI and IoT platform must support all of these tools—including, for example, the Eclipse IDE, VI, Visual Studio, React, Angular, R Studio, and Jupyter—or it will be rejected as unusable by the IT development teams.
•Open, Extensible, Future-Proof. The current pace of software and algorithm innovation is accelerating. The techniques used today will likely be obsolete in five to 10 years. An AI and IoT platform architecture must therefore provide the capability to replace any components with their next-generation improvements. Moreover, the platform must enable the incorporation of any new open source or proprietary software innovations without adversely affecting the functionality or performance of an organization’s existing applications. This is a level-zero requirement.
To meet this extensive set of requirements, C3 AI has spent the last decade and invested over $1.0 billion researching and refining these requirements, and in developing and enhancing the C3 AI Application Platform to address these requirements. The C3 AI Application Platform has been refined, tested, and proven in some of the most demanding industries and production environments—electric utilities, manufacturing, oil and gas, and defense—comprising petabyte-scale datasets from thousands of vastly disparate source systems, massive volumes of high-frequency time series data from millions of devices, and hundreds of thousands of machine learning models.
Awash in “AI Platforms”
Industry analysts estimate that organizations will invest $500 billion annually in AI software by 2024. According to a leading consulting firm, companies will generate $15 trillion annually in added value by 2030 from the use of these new technologies. This is the fastest-growing enterprise software market in history and represents an entire replacement market for enterprise application software.
Today the market is awash in “AI Platforms” that purport to be solutions sufficient to design, develop, provision, and operate Enterprise AI applications, including Cassandra, Cloudera, DataStax, AWS IoT, and Hadoop. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, each of which offer an elastic cloud computing platform. In addition, each offers an increasingly innovative library of microservices that can be used for data aggregation, ETL, queuing, data streaming, MapReduce, continuous analytics processing, machine learning services, data visualization, etc. They all appear to do the same thing and they all appear to provide a complete Enterprise AI platform. While these products are useful, we believe that none offers the scope of utility necessary and sufficient to develop and operate an Enterprise AI or IoT application.
Consider Cassandra, for example. It is a key-value data store, a special-purpose database that is particularly useful for storing and retrieving longitudinal data, like telemetry. For that purpose, it is an effective product. But that functionality represents only a small fraction of the required solution. Likewise, HDFS is a distributed file system, useful for storing unstructured data. TensorFlow, a set of math libraries published by Google Cloud, is useful in enabling certain types of machine learning models. AWS IoT is a utility for gathering data from machine-readable IoT sensors. The point is: these utilities are all useful, but we believe none is sufficient by itself. Each addresses only a part of the problem required to develop and deploy an Enterprise AI or IoT application.
Moreover, our experience is that these utilities are written in different languages, with different computational models and potentially incompatible data structures, developed by programmers of varying levels of experience and training from a variety of sources, rather than being designed from the start to work together. In our experience, few, if any, were written to commercial programming standards necessary to meet the requirements of an enterprise-scale deployment. Many of these efforts have ultimately been contributed to the open source community, which includes a growing collection of hundreds of computer source code programs available for anyone to download, modify at will, and use at no cost, rather than being deployed as enterprise-scale commercial solutions.
“Do It Yourself” Enterprise AI?
Software innovation cycles follow a typical pattern. Early in the cycle, companies often take a “do it yourself” approach and try building the new technology themselves. In the 1980s, for example, when Oracle first introduced relational database management system, or RDBMS, software to the market, interest was high. RDBMS technology offered dramatic cost economies and productivity gains in application development and maintenance. We believe it proved an enabling technology for the next generation of enterprise applications that followed, including material requirements planning, or MRP, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, customer relationship management, or CRM, manufacturing automation, and others.
The early competitors in the RDBMS market included Oracle, IBM (DB2), Relational Technology (Ingres), and Sperry (Mapper). But the primary competitor to Oracle was not any of these companies. It was in many cases the CIO, who attempted to build the organization’s own RDBMS with IT personnel, offshore personnel, or the help of a systems integrator. When those efforts failed, the CIO was replaced and the organization installed a commercial RDBMS.
When enterprise applications including ERP and CRM were introduced to the market in the 1990s, the primary competitors included Oracle, SAP, and Siebel Systems. But in the early years of that innovation cycle, many CIOs attempted to develop these complex enterprise applications internally. Hundreds of person-years and hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on those projects. A few years later, a new CIO would install a working commercial system.
Some of the most technologically astute companies—including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Compaq—repeatedly failed at internally developed CRM projects. All ultimately became successful Siebel Systems CRM customers.
Just as happened with the introduction of RDBMS, ERP, and CRM software in prior innovation cycles, the initial reaction of many IT organizations is to try to internally develop a general-purpose Enterprise AI and IoT platform, using open source software with a combination of microservices from cloud providers like AWS and Google Cloud. The process starts by taking some subset of myriad proprietary and open source solutions and organizing them into a platform architecture.
The next step is to assemble hundreds to thousands of programmers, frequently distributed around the world, using structured programming and application programming interfaces, or APIs, to attempt to stitch these various programs, data sources, sensors, machine learning models, development tools, and user interface paradigms together into a unified, functional, seamless whole that will enable the organization to excel at designing, developing, provisioning, and deploying numerous enterprise scale AI and IoT applications.
The complexity of such a system is much greater than developing a CRM or ERP system. There are a number of problems with this approach:
•Complexity. Using structured programming, the number of software API connections that one needs to establish, harden, test, and verify for a complex system can, in our estimation, approach the order of 1013. The developers of the system need to individually and collectively grasp that level of complexity to get it to work. We believe the number of programmers capable of dealing with that level of complexity is quite small.
Aside from the platform developers, the application developers and data scientists also need to understand the complexity of the architecture and all the underlying data and process dependencies in order to develop any application.
•Brittleness. Spaghetti-code applications of this nature are highly dependent upon each and every component working properly. If one developer introduces a bug into any one of the open source components, all applications developed with that platform may cease to function.
•Future Proof. As new libraries, faster databases, and new machine learning techniques become available, those new utilities need to be available within the platform. Consequently, every application that was built on the platform will likely need to be reprogrammed in order to function correctly. This may take months to years.
•Data Integration. An integrated, federated common object data model is absolutely necessary for this application domain. Using this type of structured programming, API-driven architecture may require hundreds of person-years to develop an integrated data model for any large corporation. This is the primary reason why tens to hundreds of millions of dollars are spent, and several years later, no applications are deployed. The Fortune 500 is littered with such disaster stories.
The Gordian Knot of Structured Programming
Structured programming is a technique introduced in the mid-1960s to simplify code development, testing, and maintenance. Prior to structured programming, software was written in large monolithic tomes replete with APIs and “go-to” statements. The resultant product might consist of millions of lines of code with thousands of such APIs and go-to statements that were difficult to develop, understand, debug, and maintain.
The essential idea of structured programming was to break the code into a relatively simple “main routine” and then use something called an application programming interface to call subroutines that were designed to be modular and reusable. Example subroutines might provide services like complete a ballistics calculation, or a fast Fourier transform, a linear regression, an average, a sum, or a mean. Structured programming remains the state of the art for many applications today, and has dramatically simplified the process of developing and maintaining computer code.
While this technique is appropriate for many classes of applications, it breaks down with the complexity and scale of the requirements for a modern Enterprise AI or IoT application, resulting in a Gordian knot.
Cloud Vendor Tools
An alternative to the open source cluster is to attempt to assemble the various services and microservices offered by the cloud providers into a working seamless and cohesive Enterprise AI and IoT platform. Leading vendors like AWS are developing increasingly useful services and microservices that in many cases replicate the functionality of the open source providers and in many cases provide new and unique functionality. The advantage of this approach over open source is that these products are developed, tested, and quality assured by highly professional enterprise engineering organizations. In addition, these services were generally designed and developed with the specific purpose that they would work together and interact in a common system. The same points hold true for Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and IBM.
The problem with this approach is that because these systems lack a model-driven architecture like that of the C3 AI Application Platform, described in the following section, programmers still need to employ structured programming to stitch together the various services. This results in the same type of complexity previously described—many lines of spaghetti code and numerous interdependencies that create brittle applications that are difficult and costly to maintain.
The difference between using structured programming with cloud vendor services and using the model-driven architecture of the C3 AI Application Platform is dramatic. To demonstrate this stark difference, C3 AI commissioned a third-party consultancy to develop an AI predictive maintenance application designed to run on the AWS cloud platform. The consultancy—a Premier AWS Consulting Partner, with significant experience developing enterprise applications on AWS for Fortune 2000 customers—was asked to develop the application using two different approaches: the C3 AI Application Platform and structured programming.
The time to develop and deploy this application was approximately 120 person-days at a cost in 2019 dollars of approximately $458,000. The effort required writing 16,000 lines of custom code that must be maintained over the life of the application. The resulting application runs only on AWS. To run this application on Google Cloud, it may have to be completely rebuilt for each of those platforms at a similar cost, time, and coding effort. 
By contrast, using C3 AI Software, with its modern model-driven architecture, the same application, employing the same AWS services, was developed, and tested in five person-days at a cost of approximately $19,000. Only 14 lines of code were generated, dramatically decreasing the lifetime cost of maintenance. Moreover, the application will run on any cloud platform without modification, eliminating any additional effort and cost of refactoring the application if moving it to a different cloud vendor.
C3 AI Application Platform: Model-Driven Architecture
The notion of a model-driven architecture was developed at the beginning of the 21st century in response to the growing complexity of enterprise application development requirements. Model-driven architecture provides the knife to cut the Gordian knot of structured programming for highly complex problems. The C3 AI Application Platform is designed and built with a model-driven architecture.
Central to a model-driven architecture is the concept of a “model” that serves as an abstraction layer to simplify the programming problem. Using models, the programmer or application developer does not have to be concerned with all the data types, data interconnections, and processes that act on the data associated with any given entity, e.g., customer, tractor, doctor, or fuel type. He or she simply needs to address the model for any given entity—e.g., customer—and all the underlying data, data interrelationships, pointers, APIs, associations, connections, and processes associated with or used to manipulate those data are abstracted in the model itself.
Using the C3 AI Application Platform and its model-driven architecture, virtually anything can be represented as a model—even, for example, applications, including databases, natural language processing engines, and image recognition systems. Models also support a concept called inheritance. An AI application built with the C3 AI Application Platform might include a model called relational database, that in turn serves as a placeholder that might incorporate any relational database system like Oracle, Postgres, Aurora, Spanner, or SQL Server. A key-value store model might contain Cassandra, HBase, Cosmos DB, or DynamoDB.
C3 AI Reduces Complexity, Simplifies Development
With its model-driven architecture, the C3 AI Application Platform provides an abstraction layer and semantics to represent the application. This frees the programmer from having to worry about data mapping, API syntax, and the mechanics of myriad computational processes such as ETL, queuing, pipeline management, encryption, etc.
The optimal design for an object model to address Enterprise AI and IoT applications uses abstract models as placeholders to which a programmer can link an appropriate application. The relational database model might link to Postgres. A report writer model might link to MicroStrategy. A data visualization model might link to Tableau. And so on. A powerful feature of a model-driven architecture is that as new open source or proprietary solutions become available, the object model library can simply be extended to incorporate that new feature.
Another important capability of the C3 AI Application Platform enabled by its model-driven architecture is that the applications developed on the platform are future-proofed: due to the modular nature of the model-driven architecture, new, upgraded, or enhanced services can be easily integrated with the C3 AI Application Platform. Suppose, for example, that an organization developed all its applications initially using Oracle as the relational database and then later decided to switch to an alternate RDBMS. The only modification required is to change the link in the RDBMS meta-model to point to the new RDBMS. All the applications deployed previously using Oracle as the RDBMS will continue to run without modification after that replacement. This enables organizations to immediately and easily take advantage of new and improved product offerings as they become available.
Platform Independence: Multi-Cloud and Polyglot Cloud Deployment
The rate of cloud computing adoption in recent years has been dramatic and continues to accelerate. As recently as 2011, the message delivered by chief executive officers and corporate leadership worldwide was clear: “Our data will never reside in the public cloud.” The message today is equally clear: “We have a cloud-first strategy. All new applications are being deployed in the cloud. Existing applications will be migrating to the cloud. But understand, we have a multi-cloud strategy.”
This 180-degree turn at global scale is remarkable. But while corporate leaders are eagerly embracing the cloud, they are also very concerned about cloud vendor lock-in. They want to be able to continually negotiate. They want to deploy different applications in clouds from different vendors, and they want to be free to move applications from one cloud vendor to another.
Multi-cloud deployment is therefore an additional requirement of a modern model-driven software platform that is fully supported by the C3 AI Application Platform. Applications developed with the C3 AI Application Platform can run without modification on any cloud and on bare metal behind the firewall in a hybrid cloud environment.
A final requirement for the new AI technology stack—that the C3 AI Application Platform delivers—is polyglot cloud deployment capability: the ability to mix various services from multiple cloud providers and to easily swap and replace those services. The cloud vendors provide the market a great service by enabling instant access to virtually unlimited horizontally scalable computing capacity and effectively infinite storage capacity at exceptionally low cost. As the cloud vendors aggressively compete with one another on price, the cost of cloud computing and storage is consistently decreasing.
A second important service cloud vendors provide is rapid innovation of microservices. Microservices like TensorFlow from Google accelerate machine learning. Amazon Forecast facilitates deep learning for time-series data. Azure Stream Analytics integrates with Azure IoT Hub and Azure IoT Suite to enable powerful real-time analytics of IoT sensor data. It seems not a week goes by without another announcement of yet another useful microservice from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. 
C3 AI Application Platform: A Tested, Proven, and Patented AI Suite
The model-driven approach to developing Enterprise AI and IoT applications using the C3 AI Application Platform has been tested and proven in dozens of large-scale, real-world deployments at some of the world’s largest organizations.
C3 AI provides a powerful platform enabling these and other leading organizations to develop and operate Enterprise AI and IoT applications at scale, with a fraction of the effort and resources required by other approaches. Applications built with the C3 AI Application Platform are flexible, easily upgraded, and can be ported across different cloud platforms with little or no modification, providing a solution that future-proofs customers’ investment in Enterprise AI and IoT application development. 
Competition
Our main sources of current and potential competition fall into several categories:
•internal IT organizations that develop internal solutions and provide self‑support for their enterprises;
•commercial enterprise and point solution software providers;
•open source software providers with data management, machine learning, and analytics offerings;
•public cloud providers offering discrete tools and micro-services with data management, machine learning, and analytics functionality;
•system integrators that develop and provide custom software solutions;
•legacy data management product providers; and
•strategic and technology partners who may also offer our competitors’ technology or otherwise partner with them, including our strategic partners who may offer a substantially similar solution based on a competitor’s technology or internally developed technology that is competitive with ours.
Our primary competition is largely do-it-yourself, custom-developed, company-specific AI platforms and applications developed by internal IT organizations. Such efforts usually involve the integration of internally developed tools, open source solutions, and point solutions offered by independent software vendors, and/or components offered in the AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud platforms. Frequently these efforts will be managed as professional service projects by organizations like Accenture or Lockheed Martin. These tend to be very costly and time-consuming software engineering projects, often fail, and, if at all successful, usually require many years to realize economic return. Most of our customers have tried and failed at one or more such bespoke development efforts, sometimes at great expense, before turning to C3 AI for their AI solution.
We are unaware of any end-to-end Enterprise AI development platforms that are directly competitive with the C3 AI Application Platform. The commercial product offerings that were formerly positioned as functionally equivalent to C3 AI were GE Predix and IBM Watson, both multibillion-dollar software engineering efforts backed by massive promotional campaigns; we do not encounter them in competitive situations.
Sales Alliances
Strategic partnerships are core to our growth strategy with market-leading companies offering highly leveraged distribution channels to various markets. Examples of these partnerships are listed below:
•Google Cloud: In September 2021, we entered a partnership with Google Cloud to help organizations across multiple industries accelerate their application of AI solutions. Under the agreement, both companies’ global sales teams co-sell our Enterprise AI applications, running on Google Cloud.
•Baker Hughes: Oil, Gas, and Chemicals. In 2019, we a formed a strategic alliance with Baker Hughes, a $24 billion oil and gas services company. We renewed and expanded the alliance with a new agreement in 2021. Under the terms of this alliance, Baker Hughes has standardized on C3 AI for all internal use AI applications. In addition, we are jointly marketing and selling a range of Enterprise AI solutions to address the entire value of upstream, mid-stream, and downstream activity under the BHC3.ai brand to oil and gas companies globally with the active engagement of Baker Hughes, which has a 12,000-person sales organization.
•AWS, Intel, and Microsoft. In addition, we have announced global alliances with AWS, Intel, and Microsoft to jointly market, sell, and service our combined offerings across industry verticals.
In the majority of our sales opportunities we are aligned with one or more of our partners.
Thought Leadership
Our CEO, Tom Siebel, and our Chief Technology Officer, Ed Abbo, are recognized leaders in information technology, facilitating broad market validation by media, analysts, and industry groups. Their decades of technology leadership in enterprise software position them well to engage strategically with the executive leadership of leading corporations and government entities.
We have launched a communications strategy with the objective of establishing thought leadership in Enterprise AI and Digital Transformation. We believe our CEO’s bestselling book, Digital Transformation: Survive and Thrive in an Era of Mass Extinction, has contributed to this effort.
We will continue to expand our thought leadership in Enterprise AI through ongoing publications, industry conferences, advertising, keynote speeches, media interviews, television appearances, blog posts, and contributed articles.
Growth Strategy
We are substantially investing in the expansion of our direct enterprise sales and service organization both geographically and across vertical markets to expand the use of C3 AI solutions within existing customers and establish new customer relationships.
We are growing a middle market sales organization to address the needs of divisions of large organizations in addition to small and medium businesses. 
We will expand our leveraged distribution channel with additional distribution partners.
We will continue to develop high volume distribution channels including digital marketing, telesales, and strategic distributors, particularly to address the needs of small and medium businesses.
We are bringing new product families to market, such as C3 AI CRM, that we believe will develop into substantial recurring revenue streams for C3 AI.
We expect to form additional strategic development and distribution agreements, like those we have in place with Microsoft and Baker Hughes, that we expect will provide us highly leveraged access to other vertical and horizontal markets. 
We continue to invest heavily in research and development to maintain technology leadership. Our product roadmap includes a wide range of new functions and products to be released in the coming years that we expect to contribute to revenue growth with both new and existing customers.
