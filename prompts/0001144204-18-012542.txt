Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing products for treating diseases and disorders of the eye. We accomplish this by leveraging our two proprietary platform technologies, crosslinked thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid (“CMHA-S”) and our iontophoresis drug delivery system.
 
We are developing products using CMHA-S, a modified form of the natural polymer hyaluronic acid, which is a gel that possesses unique physical and chemical properties such as hydrating and healing properties when applied to the ocular surface. The ability of CMHA-S to adhere longer to the ocular surface, resist degradation and protect the ocular surface makes it well-suited for treating various ocular surface injuries. Our first CMHA-S-based product, the EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel (“OBG”), has completed a pilot trial where we announced positive top-line data. OBG is a topically-applied eye drop formulation that is being developed under the 510(k) De Novo path for devices submitted for marketing clearance to the U.S. FDA.
 
The CMHA-S platform is based on hyaluronic acid (“HA”), a naturally occurring polymer that is important in many physiological processes, including wound healing, tissue homeostasis, and joint lubrication. To create hydrogels, the HA is modified to create CMHA-S that is then cross-linked together through the thiol groups. Some products employ disulfide cross-linking while others utilize a Polyethylene Glycol Diacrylate, or PEGDA, cross-linker. Cross-linking slows degradation of the HA backbone and provides a matrix for incorporating therapeutic agents. Variations in the number of thiols per molecule, the molecular weight of the polymer, the concentration of the polymer, the type of cross-linking, and incorporation of active ingredients, provides a highly versatile platform that can be tailored to a specific application. CMHA-S can be formulated as gels or films.
 
Our first CMHA-S-based product candidate, the EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel (“OBG”), is a topically-applied eye drop formulation that has completed its first-in-man clinical trial. We announced positive top-line data from the initial pilot trial evaluating the ability of EyeGate OBG to accelerate ocular surface re-epithelialization following photorefractive keratectomy (“PRK”). The EyeGate OBG eye drop creates a thin, durable and protective coating to the damaged surface of the eye, serving to facilitate and accelerate corneal re-epithelization. The EyeGate OBG is intended for the management of corneal epithelial wounds, defects, and epitheliopathies.
 
Preclinical studies suggest that the specific CMHA-S chemical modification comprising the EyeGate OBG creates a favorable set of attributes, including prolonged retention time on the ocular surface, and a smooth continuous clear barrier without blur that can minimize mechanical lid friction, reduce repeat injury, and mechanically protect the ocular surface, allowing accelerated corneal re-epithelization.
 
The gel is presently available commercially as a veterinary device indicated for use in the management of superficial corneal ulcers. Manufactured by SentrX Animal Care and sold in the U.S. by Bayer Animal Health as Remend® Corneal Repair, the product has been used successfully for five years in dogs, cats and horses, without adverse effects. The composition of the veterinary product is identical to that of the EyeGate OBG. We do not have the rights to the CMHA-S platform for animal health or veterinary medicine.
 
In addition, we are developing EGP-437, which incorporates a reformulated topically active corticosteroid, Dexamethasone Phosphate, that is delivered into the ocular tissues through our proprietary innovative drug delivery system, the EyeGate® II Delivery System. EGP-437 is being developed under the 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, regulatory pathway for drugs submitted for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its NDA.
 
The EyeGate® II Delivery System features a compact, elegant, and easy-to-use device that we believe has the potential to deliver drugs non-invasively and quickly into the ocular tissues through the use of iontophoresis, which can accelerate the onset of action, dramatically reduce treatment frequency versus eye drops and sustain therapeutic effect. Iontophoresis employs the use of a low electrical current that promotes the migration of a charged drug substance across biological membranes. The current produces ions, which through electrorepulsion, drive a like-charged drug substance into the tissues. The EyeGate® II Delivery System is easy-to-use, only takes a few minutes to employ and more than 3,000 treatments have been administered in clinical trials.
 
We are developing EGP-437 for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions of the eye, including the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain in post-surgical cataract patients and anterior uveitis, a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris and/or ciliary body. Based on guidance provided by the FDA, we expect that if the planned confirmatory Phase 3 trial of EGP-437 in anterior uveitis meets non-inferiority criteria, data from this trial along with data from our previously completed Phase 3 trial in anterior uveitis will be sufficient to support an NDA filing. We also believe, based on guidance provided by the FDA, that the design of the planned confirmatory Phase 3 anterior uveitis trial is acceptable and that the nonclinical work completed to date is sufficient to support an NDA filing.

We have entered into two exclusive global license agreements with a subsidiary of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (“Valeant”) through which we granted Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to our EyeGate® II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product, or the Product, in the fields of anterior uveitis and ocular iontophoretic treatment for post-operative ocular inflammation and pain in ocular surgery patients, as well as a right of last negotiation to license the Product for other indications. We are responsible for the development of the Product in the U.S. for the indication of anterior uveitis, together with the costs associated therewith. Valeant has the right to develop the Product in the fields outside of the U.S. and has agreed to fund 100% of any costs associated therewith.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products for treating diseases and disorders of the eye. The key elements of this strategy are to:

· | Continue clinical development of our EyeGate OBG device for the treatment of corneal epithelial defects. We completed our first-in-man trial enrolling subjects with a 9mm corneal wound, a large corneal epithelial defect, post photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery and released positive top-line data in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to initiate a masked controlled pilot trial in the first half of 2018.

· | Initiate clinical development of our EyeGate OBG device for the treatment of punctate epitheliopathies. We anticipate submitting a second IDE in the first quarter of 2018 to begin a clinical trial focused on treating patients with punctate epitheliopathies as confirmed by fluorescein staining of the cornea. We expect to initiate a masked controlled pilot trial in the first half of 2018. 
· | Continue to analyze the data from our recently completed Phase 2b trial with our EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of inflammation and pain post cataract surgery. We have recently completed enrollment of a 100 subject double-masked placebo controlled Phase 2b trial and announced topline data for this trial in the first quarter of 2018. Although EGP-437 demonstrated a higher rate of success compared to vehicle at all time points, the co-primary endpoints of proportion of subjects with an anterior chamber cell (ACC) count of zero at day 7 and the proportion of subjects with a pain score of zero at day 1 did not show statistical significance. The efficacy results for the absence of inflammatory cells in the EGP-437 treatment group met our expectations, but the vehicle group response was better than anticipated. We will continue to review the data to determine next steps and to continue evaluating EGP-437 for the reduction of pain and inflammation following ocular surgery. 
· | Continue clinical development of our EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. We have initiated and continue enrolling patients for the confirmatory Phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of our EGP-437 Combination Product for the treatment of noninfectious anterior uveitis. Based on our estimates regarding subject enrollment, we expect to have topline data for this trial in the third quarter of 2018. 
· | Utilize the EyeGate iontophoresis expertise to expand our drug delivery platform for the treatment of eye diseases. Our initial platform, the EyeGate® II Drug Delivery System, is an in-office treatment performed by an eye care giver. We plan to develop a system based on iontophoresis that could be applied at home by the patient. This would be ideal for the treatment of certain chronic ocular diseases where less frequent visits to the eye care givers office are required. 


· | Pursue other strategic collaborations. We plan to evaluate opportunities to enter into collaborations that may contribute to our ability to advance our drug delivery platform and product candidates and to progress concurrently a range of discovery and development programs. We also plan to evaluate opportunities to in-license or acquire the rights to other products, product candidates or technologies for the treatment of eye diseases.

Ophthalmic Market Opportunity
 
Ophthalmology is a specialty market with commercial and regulatory dynamics that make it possible for small or medium sized companies like us to develop and commercialize products on our own. We believe that the specialists in the U.S. who treat ocular diseases are sufficiently concentrated that we could effectively promote our products with a specialty sales and marketing group.
 
EyeGate OBG
 
The EyeGate OBG is a synthetic biocompatible cross-linked thiolated carboxymethyl hyaluronic acid (CMHA-S) hydrogel capable of coating the ocular surface and designed to resist degradation under conditions present in the eye. This prolongs residence time of the bandage on the ocular surface, thereby addressing the limitations of current non-cross-linked hyaluronic acid formulations. Additionally, cross-linking allows the product’s viscosity to be modified to meet optimum ocular needs. The increased viscosity and non-covalent muco-adhesive interfacial forces improve residence time in the tear film, thus providing a coating that aids and promotes re-epithelization of the ocular surface via physical protection.
 
The EyeGate OBG exhibits significant shear thinning properties. This feature allows the CMHA-S polymer to act as a more concentrated, viscous barrier at low shear rates in a resting tear film, but also as a lower resistance fluid (therefore thinned) during high shear events such as blinking. This property enables better residence time and a more favorable ocular surface coating with less optical blur. This should enhance ocular surface protection and patient comfort.
 
The EyeGate OBG has been shown to provide a mechanical barrier that aids in the management of corneal epithelial defects and accelerates re-epithelization in both preclinical studies and in clinical ophthalmic veterinary use. As such, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery was chosen as the subject population which is best suited to demonstrate this effect. PRK is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or anterior basement membrane disease. The primary effectiveness endpoint for this initial pilot trial was time to re-epithelization of a large epithelial defect following PRK surgery. We completed the initial trial and announced positive top-line data in the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate initiating our next pilot trial in the first half of 2018.
 
We believe that the EyeGate OBG can be used for the management of a variety of large and small corneal epithelial defects including Punctate Epitheliopathies. Punctate Epitheliopathies are an early sign of epithelial compromise and are associated with a variety of pathologic ocular inflammatory conditions including ocular causes, as well as systemic diseases. This ocular surface condition is common and may represent areas of epithelial cell damage and loss and therefore stain positively with fluorescein. Causes can include dry eye, acute and chronic bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, trauma, contact lens wear (tight lens syndrome), chemical irritation and burns, diabetic and infectious neuropathies, chemotherapy and corneal abrasion. We plan on submitting a second IDE to the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 for the development of EyeGate OBG for treating Punctate Epitheliopathies. We anticipate initiating our first pilot trial in the first half of 2018.
 
EyeGate® II Delivery System and EGP-437
 
Delivery of therapeutic agents using ocular iontophoresis has been of interest as a means of non-invasively achieving higher drug levels within the eye by promoting the migration of a charged drug substance across biological membranes with a low electrical current. The EyeGate® II Delivery System applicator utilizes an inert electrode, which stimulates the electrolysis of water to produce ions (hydroxide or hydronium), which via electrorepulsion, drive a like-charged drug substance into the ocular tissues. The EyeGate® II Delivery System delivery platform requires custom pharmaceutical formulations to enable delivery efficiency and safety while allowing for potential novel intellectual property. The data from multiple clinical trials suggests that EGP-437 does not significantly raise mean intraocular pressure, or IOP, at the time points evaluated during the study period.
 
Many front of the eye diseases such as cataract surgery and non-infectious anterior uveitis are acute inflammatory conditions. The current standard of care to treat ocular surface and anterior segment inflammation is patient administered corticosteroids in the form of eye drops. Topical corticosteroids suffer from a number of drawbacks including low ocular bioavailability, rapid clearance and steroid-related side effects including elevated IOP. We believe that our EGP-437 Combination Product has the potential to address these unmet needs by providing in-office treatments given by the eye care provider thereby mitigating the patient compliance issues and substantially reducing the burden of care.
 
Currently, the only primary route of administration for drugs treating retinal diseases is through intravitreal injection into the vitreous of the eye. These injections must be given as frequently as once per month when treating chronic diseases like macular degeneration. Unfortunately, there are known drawbacks associated with administering intravitreal injections, including safety risks, adverse patient experience and being time- and labor-intensive to administer. Data from our Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept macular edema trial suggests that iontophoresis can non-invasively deliver EGP-437 to the back of the eye. The non-invasive delivery of EGP-437 has demonstrated a positive response in some patients with macular edema.

Current Targeted Indications
 
EyeGate OBG: Large Corneal Epithelial Defects
 
The EyeGate OBG provides a thin coating to the surface of the eye, serving as a protectant to facilitate and accelerate corneal re-epithelization. EyeGate conducted a randomized masked, prospective study of the safety and performance of the EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel, a 0.75% crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid applied topically for accelerating re-epithelization of large corneal epithelial defects resulting from photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) used in combination with and without a bandage contact lens.
 
Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or anterior basement membrane disease. PRK involves controlled mechanical removal of corneal epithelium with subsequent excimer laser photoablation of the underlying Bowman’s layer and anterior stroma, including the subepithelial nerve plexus.
 
The military prefers PRK as a refractive surgery due to the stability of the PRK incision and the absence of risk for flap dislocation during military active duty. Although this procedure yields desirable visual acuity results, common complications of the procedure include post-operative pain secondary to the epithelial defects, risk of corneal infection prior to re-epithelization of the large epithelial defect, corneal haze formation, decreased contrast sensitivity, and slower visual recovery.
 
EyeGate OBG: Punctate Epitheliopathies
 
Punctate Epitheliopathies, or PE, are an early sign of epithelial compromise and are associated with a variety of pathologic ocular inflammatory conditions including ocular causes, as well as systemic diseases. This ocular surface condition is common and may represent areas of epithelial cell damage and loss and therefore stain positively with fluorescein. PE is characterized by a breakdown or damage of the epithelium of the cornea in a pinpoint pattern, which can be seen with examination with a slit-lamp. Patients may present with non-specific symptoms such as red eye, tearing, foreign body sensation, photophobia and burning. Causes can include dry eye, acute and chronic bacterial and viral conjunctivitis, trauma, contact lens wear (tight lens syndrome), chemical irritation and burns, diabetic and infectious neuropathies, chemotherapy and corneal abrasion.
 
Standard of care treatments are aimed at attempting to heal these punctate micro defects and/or epitheliopathies and can include increasing humidity, artificial tears, lubricants and ointments and in severe cases can even utilize bandage contact lens, antibiotics and amniotic membrane graphs, as well as treating the underlying cause with topical anti-inflammatory and T cell modulators. The endpoint of treatment is to re-epithelize the cornea and resolve the corneal staining. Resolution of the corneal staining are frequently measured by scales such as the National Eye Institute Scale (NEI) or Oxford scale. These standardized and validated scales have been developed to help score and measure these defects. Often these current treatments fall short as they are ineffective in protecting and enabling corneal re-epithelization. The artificial tears have limited residence time and often do nothing to mechanically protect the cornea and create an environment that can accelerate corneal reepithelization and resolve staining. Furthermore, many of the ointments and gels, although offering better residence time, are thicker and blur vision, thus making them less attractive for day time use.
 
The EyeGate OBG, once applied to the eye, forms a thin layer that protects the eye to promote re-epithelization in the management of a variety of large and small corneal epithelial defects including PE.
 
EGP-437:  Cataract Surgery
 
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, and there are more than 24 million people age 40 and older who have cataracts in the U.S. alone, according to the Vision Problems in the U.S. report from Prevent Blindness. A cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. Most cataracts are related to aging and are very common in older people. By age 80, more than half of the U.S. population either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the population aged over 65 years. There are approximately three million cataract surgeries performed per year in the U.S. As the technology of cataract surgery has progressed, so too, has the increased patient demand for excellent vision and safety after the procedure, but visual rehabilitation after cataract surgery is sometimes delayed by the inflammatory processes that are induced by phacoemulsification where the eye’s internal lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic hand piece and aspirated from the eye. Inflammation is induced in all cataract surgery by the mechanical transmission of energy into the eye, disruption of cell membranes, and the normal healing process. Postoperative topical corticosteroids are used routinely to reduce inflammation and improve visual outcomes after cataract surgery. Despite their use, transient corneal edema is one of the major factors hindering the improvement of vision in the first days after surgery, and cystoid macula edema may reduce quality of vision for weeks and months after the procedure. Therefore, reducing inflammation and its potential damage to the corneal endothelium and retina is a high priority for the ophthalmic surgeon.

EGP-437:  Non-Infectious Anterior Uveitis
 
Uveitis is a general term for inflammation of the uveal tract and encompasses a wide range of etiologies. It may be iodiopathic, associated with systemic diseases or result from a variety of infectious agents. An annual estimated 17.6% of active uveitis patients experience transient or permanent loss of vision. Uveitis is responsible for more than 2.8% of cases of blindness in the U.S., making this disorder an important cause of vision loss and impairment. Non-infectious anterior uveitis is a debilitating form of intraocular inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea, such as the iris and/or ciliary body and is the most common form of uveitis. Incidence in the U.S. ranges from approximately 26.6 to 102 per 100,000 adults annually with recent reports indicating occurrence in all age groups with the highest incidence in those over age 65 years. Chronic or recurrent, anterior uveitis may lead to complications such as posterior subcapsular cataract, glaucoma and macular edema.
 
Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and white blood cells from the blood into the injured tissues, in this case the uvea. Sometimes, the inflammation associated with anterior uveitis is in response to a real infection. This is known as infectious anterior uveitis. However, anterior uveitis often occurs for no apparent reason as the result of the immune system malfunctioning and triggering the process of inflammation even though no infection is present. This is known as non-infectious anterior uveitis. Patients that have anterior uveitis exhibit a large number of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. In order to count these cells in the anterior chamber, the physician uses a slit lamp, an instrument consisting of a high-intensity light source that can be focused to shine a thin sheet of light into the eye. The treatment objective is to eliminate the inflammation of the uvea which can be confirmed by an anterior chamber cell count of zero.
 
Clinical Trial Results
 
EyeGate OBG: Large Corneal Epithelial Defects
 
In the first quarter of 2017, we reported topline results from the first-in-human pilot trial of EyeGate OBG, the acceleration of re-epithelialization of large corneal epithelial defects in patients having undergone photorefractive keratectomy (“PRK”). The prospective, randomized, controlled study enrolled 39 subjects undergoing bilateral PRK surgery and aimed to assess the safety and performance of EyeGate OBG on its own or combined with a Bandage Contact Lens (“BCL”) compared to the current standard of care, artificial tears and BCL. The primary endpoint of the study was complete wound closure by Day 3.
 
The enrolled subjects were randomized into one of three study groups, with subjects receiving the same treatment in both eyes:
 

· | Patients in arm 1 (n=12) received EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel four times daily (QID) for two weeks after surgery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Arm 2 (n=14) was comprised of EyeGate Ocular Bandage Gel QID for 2 weeks after surgery in combination with a BCL.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Arm 3 (n=13) was comprised of artificial tears administered four times daily and BCL.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The study demonstrated safety and tolerability of EyeGate OBG, with encouraging potential efficacy. 83.3% of the subjects in Arm 1 (EyeGate OBG alone) achieved complete wound closure by Day 3, compared to 53.8% of patients that received the standard of care. Thus, the OBG arm had approximately 55% more subjects achieve full wound closure on Day 3 than the standard of care arm. Also, on Day 3, the average wound length, measured horizontally and vertically was 83.3% and 66.7% smaller, respectively, for the OBG arm versus the standard or care arm. Additionally, on Day 1 (24 hours post-surgery), the average wound length, measured horizontally and vertically, was 35.9% and 27.4% smaller, respectively, for the OBG arm versus the standard-of-care arm. Based on these positive results, EyeGate plans to continue development with a double-masked, controlled trial evaluating EyeGate OBG monotherapy against BCL in the first half of 2018.

EGP-437
 
We submitted an IND for EGP-437 to the FDA on April 28, 2008. The initial protocol submitted as part of the IND application was for our Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial. Subsequently, we submitted amendments to our IND for protocols for additional trials that we have since completed on September 12, 2008, April 6, 2010, October 18, 2011, April 13, 2012 and May 20, 2015. An IND application (IND 107,846) referencing our IND (IND 77,888) was submitted by the University of Pennsylvania, School of Medicine on January 29, 2010 with a protocol for the treatment of anterior scleritis.
 
We have completed seven clinical trials under IND 107,846 for the EGP-437 Combination Product. The first two trials were executed in parallel - a Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial and a Phase 2 dry eye trial. These two trials were followed by a Phase 3 dry eye trial. Subsequently, we completed our first Phase 3 trial for non-infectious anterior uveitis. During the time that we executed the Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial we completed a Phase 2 proof-of-concept cataract surgery trial, with prophylactic treatment of the EGP-437 Combination Product. In 2016, we completed a Phase 1b/2a dose ranging trial treating inflammation and pain for subjects that have undergone cataract surgery and a Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept macular edema trial.

Cataract Surgery: Phase 1b/2a Trial (EGP-437-008)
 
We have reported positive data for our dose-ranging clinical trial for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain in post-surgical cataract patients. The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial was a multi-center, open-label trial enrolling 80 subjects who had undergone unilateral cataract extraction and implantation of a monofocal intra-ocular lens. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of iontophoretic EGP-437 in these patients following surgery.
 
The trial design included eight cohorts, ten subjects per cohort, whereby iontophoretic doses of 4.0 mA-min, 4.5 mA-min, 9.0 mA-min and 14.0 mA-min were employed and the 9.0 and 14.0 mA-min cohorts included different dosing regimens. Dosing regimens included three treatments administered on Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2 or Day 0, Day 1 and Day 4 with potential for an additional treatment at Day 7 in all cohorts. One cohort had the Day 0 treatment given prior to surgery and all other cohorts had the Day 0 treatment provided after surgery. All cohorts except one was treatment delivering EGP-437, the exception was a placebo arm. The primary endpoint for all cohorts is based on the proportion of subjects that achieved an anterior chamber cell (ACC) count of zero, with secondary endpoints measuring pain score and intra-ocular pressure.
 
A positive response was achieved demonstrating that EGP-437 delivered via our EyeGate® II Delivery System was safe and effective in reducing inflammation and preventing pain. The best responses were achieved with the 4.5mA-min and 9.0mA-min cohorts with similar or greater percentage of patients with ACC count of zero greater than Durezol* at Day 7. Both EGP-437 cohorts demonstrated a greater proportion of patients with ACC count of zero than Durezol* at Day 28. The percentage of patients with zero pain was better than Durezol* at Day 4, 7 and 14 for both EGP-437 cohorts. The optimal dose was determined to take forward into a Phase 2b trial, initiated in the third quarter of 2017.

Cataract Surgery: Phase 2b Trial (EGP-437-009)
 
We announced topline data for this trial in the first quarter of 2018. Although EGP-437 demonstrated a higher rate of success compared to vehicle at all time points, the co-primary endpoints of proportion of subjects with an anterior chamber cell (ACC) count of zero at day 7 and the proportion of subjects with a pain score of zero at day 1 did not show statistical significance. The efficacy results for the absence of inflammatory cells in the EGP-437 treatment group met our expectations, but the vehicle group response was better than anticipated. The difference in proportion of subjects with total clearing of ACC between the EGP-437 group and the Placebo widens at Day 14 and Day 28, trending towards statistical significance (see graph below). Also, the difference in average or mean cell count at Day 7 (the day for evaluating the primary endpoint) between the EGP-437 group and the Placebo group was statistically significant with a P value = 0.0096. 
 

We will continue to review the data to determine next steps and to continue evaluating EGP-437 for the reduction of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery.

Macular Edema: Phase 1b/2a Trial (EGP-437-007)
 
We have reported data for our first clinical trial treating a back of the eye indication, macular edema. The Phase 1b/2a proof-of-concept trial suggests that iontophoresis can non-invasively deliver EGP-437 to the back of the eye. The non-invasive delivery of EGP-437 has demonstrated a positive response in some patients with macular edema.
 
The completed Phase 1b / 2a clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label trial. The data reported was based on the first 19 patients enrolled and had macular edema associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion, Diabetic Retinopathy or Post-Surgical (cystoid) Macular Edema. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of iontophoretic EGP-437 in patients suffering from Macular Edema. Three treatments at 14.0 mA-min (3.5mA) were administered on Day 0, Day 4 and Day 9. Primary outcome of the trial measured reduction in mean central subfield thickness on Day 4, Day, 9 and Day 14. Ozurdex® was administered as control to patients that did not respond to the investigational therapy at Day 14 and were re-evaluated at Day 28.
 
A positive response was observed in some of the patients, with pseudophakic eyes (an eye implanted with an intraocular lens) responding better than phakic eyes (an eye with a natural lens). A positive response was demonstrated in three subpopulations of macular edema including macular edema associated with diabetes, retinal vein occlusion and inflammation or cystoid. In one example, a subject that presented with diabetic macular edema was provided with three treatments of EGP-437, Day 0, Day 4 and Day 9 and showed anatomic resolution in approximately one week after only two treatments, as illustrated by the optical coherence tomography scan below. Additionally, the investigational therapy showed no serious treatment emergent adverse effects including no increase in ocular pressure even at three times the iontophoretic dose that was used for the Company’s Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial.
 

Non-Infectious Anterior Uveitis: Phase 3 Clinical Trial (EGP-437-004)
 
Our previous Phase 1/2 non-infectious anterior uveitis clinical trial, and two dry eye clinical trials, showed that the EGP-437 dose selected for the Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis trial was well tolerated and demonstrated positive activity. The Phase 3 non-infectious anterior uveitis clinical trial was conducted to assess safety and efficacy of the EGP-437 Combination Product and evaluate its non-inferiority status to a standard of care, prednisolone acetate 1% (PA) eye drops. Communication received from the FDA, dated December 3, 2007, stated that the FDA recommends that PA, administered at least four times per day (q.i.d.), be the positive control agent for the treatment of anterior uveitis. Our trial utilized a more stringent regimen for the positive control of eight times per day in week one and six times per day in week two before going to four times per day in weeks three and four. Patients had to agree to comply with dosing regimen to be included in the trial.
 
The completed Phase 3 non-inferiority study in patients with non-infectious anterior uveitis appeared to demonstrate that two iontophoretic treatments with our EGP-437 Combination Product achieved the same response rate as the positive control for the primary efficacy endpoint, a complete clearing of anterior chamber cells, by Day 14. The control is the current standard of care, PA, which was administered multiple times daily as eye drops. Although we achieved the same response rate in our Phase 3 clinical trial, the dose of the EGP-437 Combination Product tested was just outside the pre-set non-inferiority margin for intent-to-treat and per protocol populations and did not achieve statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population as compared to the positive control based on the primary efficacy endpoint.
 

· | The EGP-437 Combination Product produced the same outcomes compared to PA while eliminating the need to apply up to eight eye drops a day, for a total of 154 drops over a four-week period - eight times per day for week one, six times per day for week two and four times per day for weeks three and four.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | This was achieved with a lower incidence of increased IOP, which is characterized as an increase of six mm Hg or more from baseline; in the EGP-437 Combined Product group, 14 subjects had 17 occurrences while 24 subjects had 41 occurrences in the PA arm.

Phase 3 Safety Discussion
 
Our EGP-437 Combination Product appears to be clinically comparable to PA topical drops. With regard to elevated IOP, no subjects in the EGP-437 Combination Product treatment arm experienced any significant increase in IOP (greater than 20mmHg), whereas the PA treatment arm had one subject with a reported IOP increase of 27mmHg. With regard to IOP-related adverse events, one subject in the EGP-437 Combination Product treatment group reported an adverse event (seen approximately three weeks after rescue was initiated) and six subjects in the PA treatment arm reported adverse events related to IOP.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial Conclusion
 
Topical corticosteroid therapy administered as frequently as every hour with tapering over the treatment period has been the mainstay for uveitis treatment since the 1950s. In this unique Phase 3 randomized, double-masked, positive-controlled clinical trial in subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis, two treatments with ocular iontophoretic delivery of EGP-437 appears to be clinically comparable to PA topical drops administered with a tapering schedule from eight drops per day to four drops per day over 28 days.
 
By Days 7 and 14, the proportion of subjects reaching ACC counts of zero was slightly greater in the EGP-437 Combination Product arm than the PA arm. This effect was more noticeable in the subgroup of subjects with a higher baseline ACC count; a higher proportion of subjects in the EGP-437 Combination Product arm reached an ACC count of zero by Days 7 and 14 in this sub-group of subjects. Safety findings were comparable for both study arms.
 
Non-Infectious Anterior Uveitis: Phase 1/2 Trial (EGP-437-001)
 
Our first clinical trial initiated with the EGP-437 Combination Product was a Phase 1/2 trial for subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis, which was defined as having anterior chamber cell (ACC) scores ≥ 1.5, or in other words, cell counts of less than or equal to 11 cells. Subjects who have anterior uveitis, exhibit a large number of white blood cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. The treatment objective is to eliminate the inflammation which can be visually confirmed when all white blood cells have been cleared from the anterior chamber. The degree of intraocular inflammation is based on a grading scheme or score that uses an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4.
 
The primary objective of this exploratory study was to define a safe and effective dose of EGP-437 in subjects with non-infectious anterior segment uveitis. The secondary objective was to evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetic profile of EGP-437 (dexamethasone and dexamethasone phosphate) following ocular dosing.
 
This multi-site, randomized, double-masked, parallel group, dose comparison, exploratory study comprised five visits conducted over 28 days. The study population was comprised of 40 eyes of 40 subjects. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of four iontophoresis dose levels of EGP-437 for approximately four minutes with up to ten subjects per treatment arm. Subjects received a single treatment only, at Day 0, subjects returned for examination on Days 1, 7, 14, and 28. Eligible subjects received one of the following four iontophoresis dose levels of EGP-437 (dexamethasone phosphate ophthalmic solution (40mg/mL)) for approximately 4 minutes: 
 

· | Treatment Group A: 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA
--+----------------------------------------


· | Treatment Group B: 4.8 mA-min at 1.2 mA
--+----------------------------------------


· | Treatment Group C: 10.0 mA-min at 2.5 mA
--+-----------------------------------------


· | Treatment Group D: 14.0 mA-min at 3.5 mA
--+-----------------------------------------

 
Following the single treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product, 48% of the subjects achieved an ACC score of zero within two weeks. By Day 28, 60% of the subjects achieved an ACC score of zero and required no further treatment. At Day 14, in the lowest treatment group, the proportion of subjects with an ACC count of zero was 4/10 (40%) and for all treatment groups was 7/40 (18%). At Day 28, in the lowest treatment group, the proportion of subjects with an ACC count of zero was higher at 6/10 (60%) and for all treatment groups was 14/40 (35%). The highest proportion of subjects with an ACC score or ACC count of zero was in the 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA treatment group at both Days 14 and 28.
 

 | | TREATMENT GROUP | 
------------------+-----------------------+---------------------+------
CHARACTERISTIC | STATISTIC OR CATEGORY | 1.6 mA-min (N = 10) | | | 4.8 mA-min (N = 10) | | 10.0 mA-min (N = 10) | 14.0 mA-min (N = 10) | | Total (N = 40) | 
ACC Score of Zero | Day 14 | | 8 (80 | )% | | 6 (60 | )% | 2 (20 | )% | | 3 (30 | )% | 19 (48 | )%
 | Day 28 | | 8 (80 | )% | | 6 (60 | )% | 5 (50 | )% | | 5 (50 | )% | 24 (60 | )%
ACC Count of Zero | Day 14 | | 4(40 | )% | | 1 (10 | )% | 1 (10 | )% | | 1 (10 | )% | 7 (18 | )%
 | Day 28 | | 6 (60 | )% | | 2 (20 | )% | 1 (10 | )% | | 5 (50 | )% | 14 (35 | )%

The median time in days to an ACC score of zero ranged from a minimum of 11.5 days in the 1.6 mA-min dose group to a maximum of 31.0 days in the 14.0 mA-min dose group. The proportion of patients with an ACC score reduction of 0.5 or more on Day 28 was 80% (eight) in the 1.6 mA-min dose group and 60% (six) in the other three dose groups. The mean change in ACC score from baseline to Day 28 ranged from a maximum of -2.25 in the 1.6 mA-min dose group to a minimum of -2.00 in the 14.0 mA-min dose group. The relatively short mean times to reach an ACC score of zero in each dose group suggest that the treatment has a rapid onset of action.
 
The results from this trial appeared to demonstrate that the most effective EGP-437 dose level is in the 1.6 mA-min at 0.4 mA dose level. The level of association between the iontophoresis treatments and achieving an ACC Score of zero was assessed and the association was estimated to be statistically significant at a 5% level of significance (p-value = 0.032) on Day 14, suggesting that the treatment differences are larger than would be expected by chance alone. The probability-value or p-value is a number between 0.00 and 1.00, and is used to demonstrate the strength of a conclusion drawn from clinical trial data. Essentially the p-value measures consistency between the results actually obtained in the trial and the “pure chance” explanation for those results. A statement and corresponding p-value are considered of strong significance if the probability of the same reaction occurring randomly or by chance is less than 5%, corresponding to a p-value of p<0.05.
 
This trial showed low short-term systemic exposure to dexamethasone following ocular iontophoresis delivery of dexamethasone phosphate, and no corticosteroid mediated effects were observed.
 
While this dose-ranging study did not include positive or negative controls, the results demonstrated that a single treatment with the EGP-437 Combination Product: (1) lowered ACC scores in the majority of patients without requiring additional treatment and (2) produced low short-term systemic exposure to dexamethasone and dexamethasone phosphate.
 
Clinical Development Plan

EyeGate OBG
 
The EyeGate OBG has been shown to provide a mechanical barrier that aids in the management of corneal epithelial wounds, defects and epitheliopathies. EyeGate OBG has been shown to accelerate re-epithelization in both preclinical studies and in clinical ophthalmic veterinary use. As such, photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery was chosen as the subject population, which is best suited to demonstrate the acceleration of re-epithelization. PRK is an efficacious alternative to patients seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) due to inadequate corneal thickness, larger pupil size, history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or anterior basement membrane disease. The primary effectiveness endpoint for this initial pilot trial was time to re-epithelization of epithelial defect following PRK surgery. We have completed the initial proof-of-concept trial and announced positive top-line data in the first quarter of 2017. We anticipate initiating a prospective, masked pilot clinical trial in the first half of 2018 for large corneal epithelial defects following PRK surgery.
 
The FDA, at the pre-submission meeting that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, asked us to file an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application prior to continuing with the development of OBG. The IDE was filed in May of 2017 and in June of 2017, 30 days following submission, we received a comment letter from the FDA. The letter asked us to complete specific tasks and to submit an IDE amendment with the results for those tasks. The majority of the comments were related to the validation of the manufacturing process for OBG. Due to the chemical characteristics of OBG, we are unable to terminally sterilize our final product. Terminal sterilization means that the product in its final container is subjected to a sterilization process such as heat or irradiation. We provide a sterile product produced by aseptic processing. In an aseptic process, the drug product, container, and closure are first subjected to sterilization methods separately, as appropriate, and then brought together. Because there is no process to sterilize the product in its final container, it is critical that containers be filled and sealed in an extremely high-quality environment. Aseptic processing involves more variables than terminal sterilization. Before aseptic assembly into a final product, the individual parts of the final product are generally subjected to various sterilization processes. Each of these manufacturing processes requires validation and control. A terminally sterilized product, on the other hand, undergoes final sterilization in a sealed container, thus limiting the possibility of error.
 
Some of the items requested from the FDA included tasks such as:
 

· | Evaluate the manufacturing process to eliminate sources which could contribute to excessive bioburden levels,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide alert and action levels for device components prior to filter sterilization,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide description of validation protocol and bacterial retention results for sterilizing grade filters,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provide percent recovery results for bioburden test methods,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Validate gamma irradiation dose for device packaging, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Include validated analytical methods to identify and quantify impurities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan on filing the IDE amendment in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate commencing our next PRK trial in the first half of 2018. We also plan on submitting a second IDE in the first quarter of 2018 for the development of OBG for the treatment of Punctate Epitheliopathies, including dry eye. We anticipate commencing this pilot trial in the first half of 2018.

EGP-437: Cataract Surgery
 
We have completed three trials (Phase 2 prophylactic, Phase 1b/2a dose-ranging and Phase 2b) and reported positive data for our Phase 1b/2a dose-ranging clinical trial for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain in post-surgical cataract patients. The design of this trial is based on treating the patients’ post-surgery and not prophylactically. The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial was a multi-center, open-label trial enrolling 80 subjects who had undergone unilateral cataract extraction and implantation of a monofocal intra-ocular lens. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of iontophoretic EGP-437 in these patients following surgery. A positive response was achieved and an optimal dose was determined to take forward into a Phase 2b trial that was initiated in the third quarter of 2017. We announced topline data for the Phase 2b trial in the first quarter of 2018. Although EGP-437 demonstrated a higher rate of success compared to vehicle at all time points, the co-primary endpoints of proportion of subjects with an anterior chamber cell (ACC) count of zero at day 7 and the proportion of subjects with a pain score of zero at day 1 did not show statistical significance. The efficacy results for the absence of inflammatory cells in the EGP-437 treatment group met our expectations, but the vehicle group response was better than anticipated. We will continue to review the data to determine next steps and to continue evaluating EGP-437 for the reduction of pain and inflammation following ocular surgery.
EGP-437: Anterior Uveitis
 
We have completed two trials (Phase 1/2 and Phase 3) for anterior uveitis and have demonstrated in the completed Phase 3 non-inferiority study that two iontophoretic treatments with our EGP-437 Combination Product achieved the same response rate as the positive control for the primary efficacy endpoint, a complete clearing of anterior chamber cells, by Day 14. This was achieved with a lower incidence of increased IOP, which is characterized as an increase of six mm Hg or more from baseline. We currently have an ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 trial underway and anticipate top-line data in the second quarter of 2018. The FDA has provided guidance that the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 trial of EGP-437 in anterior uveitis meets non-inferiority criteria, data from this trial along with data from our previously completed Phase 3 trial in anterior uveitis will be sufficient to support an NDA filing. The FDA also communicated that the design of the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 anterior uveitis trial is acceptable and that the nonclinical work completed to date is sufficient to support an NDA filing.
EGP-437: Other Indications
 
Although we have completed two trials (Phase 2 and Phase 3) for dry eye, at this time we are not anticipating any further development for this indication. We have completed a Phase 1/2 for macular edema and at this time we are assessing the next steps for this indication.

License Agreements 
 
We are a party to six license agreements as described below. Four of the six license agreements require us to pay royalties or fees to the licensor based on revenue related to the licensed technology, and the agreements with Valeant require Valeant to pay royalties to us based on revenue related to the licensed technology.
 
On February 15, 1999, we entered in to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Miami School of Medicine to license technology relating to our EyeGate® II Delivery System, which grants us the right to use certain French, European, Canadian, Japanese, American, Mexican, Korean, Brazilian and Israeli patents in our EGP-437 Combination Product. This agreement, which was amended in December 2005, requires us to pay to the University of Miami an annual license fee of $12,500.

Sales and Marketing
 
We have entered into two exclusive global License Agreements with subsidiaries of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (“Valeant”), through which we have granted Valeant exclusive, worldwide commercial and manufacturing rights to its EyeGate® II Delivery System and EGP-437 combination product (“Product”) in the fields of anterior uveitis and ocular iontophoretic treatment for post-operative ocular inflammation and pain in ocular surgery patients, as well as a right of last negotiation to license the Product for other indications.
 
If EyeGate OBG is approved by the FDA for commercial sale, we may enter into agreements with third parties to sell EyeGate OBG or we may choose to market EyeGate OBG directly to physicians in the United States through our own sales and marketing force and related internal commercialization infrastructure. If we market EyeGate OBG directly, we will need to incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to establish and train an internal sales and marketing force to market and sell EyeGate OBG.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have, and do not intend to establish an in-house manufacturing capability for our products and as a result we will depend heavily on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package our products. We currently do not have any contractual relationships with third-party manufacturers. We intend to rely on third-party suppliers that we have used in the past for the manufacturing of various components that comprise our EGP-437 Combination Product, EyeGate OBG and other contemplated clinical trials.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of each of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, method of administration, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors’ establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products currently being used for the indications that we may pursue, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.

Our competitors in the treatment of non-infectious anterior uveitis and inflammation post cataract surgery include Durezol® (Novartis AG), Lotemax® (Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.), Pred Forte® (Allergan, Inc.) and prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension (1%) (Novartis AG). We are not aware of any FDA approved eye drops for the management and the acceleration of re-epithelization of corneal epithelial defects following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgery.
 
Government Regulation
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 
FDA approval is required before any new drug, can be marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed before the trial may be initiated at that site;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, which must be accepted for filing by the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, manufacturing and control procedures and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
 
Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase 1: The product is initially introduced into healthy human patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2: The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.

· | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
According to section 505 of the FDCA, there are three types of new drug applications: (1) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness (section 505(b)(1)); (2) an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the entity that performed the studies (section 505(b)(2)); and (3) an application that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product (section 505(j)). We intend to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA for our EGP-437 Combination Product.
 
Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA enables an applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its NDA. Using this approval pathway may allow us to rely in part on information in the public domain to support the safety and effectiveness of EGP-437. The FDA may also require sponsors to perform additional clinical trials, measurements, or other types of studies or assessments (e.g., bridging studies) to support any change from the previously approved product. The review process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.
 
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents listed for the approved product on which the application relies in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly referred to as the Orange Book). Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the unchallenged listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not accept or approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.

If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for submission by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Moreover, in cases where a 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the 30-month stay will not prevent approval of the 505(b)(2) application.
 
Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit.
 
In the NDA submissions for our product candidates, we intend to follow the development and approval pathway permitted under the FDCA that we believe will maximize the commercial opportunities for these product candidates.
 
Combination Product Regulations
 
Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices may be regulated as “combination products” in the U.S. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic, or drug/biologic. Each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. In order to facilitate premarket review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of both components. We expect that the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research will have primary jurisdiction over out EGP-437 Combination Product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separate products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. We have had discussions with the FDA about the status of our EGP-437 Combination Product as a combination product and we have been told that the FDA considers our product a combination drug/device.
 
We will be subject to regulations governing medical devices separate from those governing drugs. After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, however, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

· | product labeling regulations;
--+------------------------------


· | general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


19
--


· | corrections and removals (e.g., recalls);
--+------------------------------------------


· | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | general prohibitions against the manufacture and distribution of adulterated and misbranded devices; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in civil fines, product seizures, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution of responsible individuals and us.
 
Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
Medical devices, such as our EyeGate® II Delivery System, or the EyeGate® OBG, may be evaluated either through the premarket approval, or PMA process, or the 510(k) clearance process, depending on the classification of the device.
 
The regulatory classification for the EyeGate® II Delivery System is defined under Code of Federations Regulations 21, Part 890, section 5525 (21 CFR 890.5525). The FDA has confirmed that the EyeGate® II Delivery System will be submitted under the 510(k) clearance process. The FDA has further clarified the Code to state that an iontophoresis device intended for use with a specific drug that has been approved for delivery by iontophoresis is a class II device. The EyeGate® II Delivery System will be indicated for use with a specific drug (EGP-437) that will be approved through the NDA process and therefore classified as a class II device.
 
The FDA has confirmed that the EyeGate® OBG will be submitted under the 510(k) de novo clearance process when used as a standalone device.
 
Gathering clinical evidence for devices is subject to FDA’s good clinical practice regulations, including requirements for IRB approval and informed consent. Significant risk devices require an approved investigational device exemption application before studies may begin. PMA approval typically requires, among other things, the submission of valid scientific evidence in the form of preclinical and clinical data, and a pre-approval inspection to determine if the manufacturing facility complies with cGMP practices under the quality system regulation that governs the design and all elements of the manufacture of devices. For clearance, a 510(k) must demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., must show that the device is as safe and effective as an already legally marketed device, also known as a predicate device. The evaluation of the newer device must not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than that of the predicate device. 510(k)s normally do not, but sometimes do, require clinical data for clearance.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to product/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.
 

20

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.

21

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Manufacturing Requirements
 
We and our third party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to FDA’s cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, extensive records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third party manufacturers and certain key component suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including untitled letters, warning letters, determinations of product adulteration, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. Such perceived problems concerning safety or efficacy may arise in the context of clinical studies continued as a result of our post-marketing obligations, reports we or FDA receive from patients and healthcare providers, or literature published by third parties regarding our products or similar products.
Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Reimbursement is expected to use standard approaches for Ophthalmology with EGP-437 reimbursed as a physician-administered drug using a drug code (J-code) and the procedure reimbursed via a CPT code in addition to the standard reimbursement for office visits. The commercial success of our EGP-437 Combination Product and, if and when commercialized, our other product candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors at the federal, state and private levels, including U.S. Government payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems.

22
--

 

We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to these initiatives and the trend toward managed healthcare and the increasing influence of managed care organizations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 
Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our EGP-437 Combination Product and operate profitably.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the applicable regulatory agency will have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had seventeen full time employees.
 
Business Segment and Geographical Information
 
Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. We view our operations and manage our business in one operating segment. We operate in one geographic segment (research and development).
