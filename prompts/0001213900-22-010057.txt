Item 1. Business
Introduction 



Purple’s mission is to help “every body” sleep, feel and live better through innovative comfort solutions.



We are a digitally-native vertical brand founded on comfort product innovation with premium offerings. We design and manufacture a variety of innovative, branded and premium comfort products, including mattresses, pillows, cushions, bases, sheets and more. Our products are the result of decades of innovation and investment in proprietary and patented comfort technologies and the development of our own manufacturing processes. Our proprietary gel technology, Hyper-Elastic Polymer®, known as the Purple Grid®, underpins many of our comfort products and provides a range of benefits that differentiate our offerings from other competitors’ products. Specially engineered for enhanced pressure relief and unwavering support, Purple’s patented grid technology has been used and tested rigorously within medical and consumer applications for over 30 years. Originally designed for use in hospital beds and wheelchairs, we adapted this unique pressure-relieving material for our mattresses and other cushion products.



We market and sell our products through direct-to-consumer e-commerce and Purple retail showrooms (collectively “DTC”) and retail brick-and-mortar wholesale partners.



The foundation of our business is core competencies in design, development and manufacturing. Decades of accumulated knowledge enable us to create all aspects of our innovative products, including fundamental comfort technologies and machines and processes necessary to bring them to market. We have integrated our operations to include research and development, marketing and manufacturing, resulting in an ability to rapidly test, learn, adapt and scale our product offerings. In order to solve complex manufacturing challenges such as large-format injection molding of our Purple Grid, we designed and produced our own manufacturing equipment including our proprietary and patented Mattress Max™ machinery. These were and still are fully customized machines unique to Purple that can handle both our size and scale requirements. We believe our combination of patents and intellectual property, proprietary and patented manufacturing equipment, production processes and decades of acquired knowledge create an advantage over our competitors who rely on commoditized materials, such as foam and outsourced manufacturing.




In addition to developing transformative, differentiated products and technologies, we have built a brand that has high customer engagement and avid brand advocates. We have an experienced marketing team, providing efficient customer acquisition and brand demand development. Our marketing strategy enables us to market our full product suite to customers, generate frequent interactions online and drive traffic to all channels offering our products. Evidencing the strength of our brand, our close rate among consumers who are considering a purchase was at an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2021.



As a native DTC brand, our knowledge of and engagement with consumers across digital and brick and mortar retail channels is advantageous and increasing. To complement our DTC efforts, we have developed multiple wholesale relationships with best-in-class retailers in the furniture, mattress specialty, home décor, and department store spaces. We believe our distinctly differentiated products, marketing strategies, manufacturing capabilities, unique branding and proprietary technologies position us to continue to drive our growth in comfort products. By fourth quarter 2021, we believe we increased our share in the overall mattress category nearly a full percentage point from the previous high in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021. In 2021, our DTC sales, which includes online and Purple retail showrooms, accounted for 65.3% of our net revenues and wholesale accounted for 34.7% of net revenues, while sales of sleep products accounted for 91.5% of our net revenues and other products accounted for 8.5%.



In 2021, Purple opened and scaled a new facility in McDonough, Georgia to create growth-supporting capacity and a manufacturing footprint that serves our customers in the eastern U.S. We also grew our DTC efforts by adding 19 Purple retail showrooms in 2021 and two thus far in 2022, making a total of 30 Company showroom locations in cities across the United States. We anticipate opening additional Purple retail showrooms throughout 2022 and to eventually have more than 200 showrooms.

Industry and Competition 



Our portfolio of products is driven by our commitment to innovating real comfort solutions that meaningfully help “every body” sleep, feel and live better. Whether it’s getting a better night’s rest or elevating the work from home experience, we design and manufacture truly innovative, differentiated products that put our customer’s comfort first.
Sleep Products 



The sleep products category encompasses a variety of products including mattresses, pillows, bases, foundations, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and duvets. Meaningful innovation in sleep products has remained stagnant and limited over the last 150 years. Coil spring mattresses and memory foam, two of the primary materials underpinning mattress technology today, were invented in the 1860’s and 1990’s. Latex, water and air mattresses followed, emerging in the latter part of the 20th century. Since these early inventions, the mattress industry has remained complacent with little meaningful innovation, until the introduction of the Purple Grid. Our Purple Grid, made from our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer, represents a meaningful innovation in pressure relief, temperature neutrality, responsiveness, durability and limited motion transfer. The Purple Grid solves problems that regular mattresses create and has proven that material innovations can have a positive impact on sleep.



Beginning in 2015, the market for sleep products underwent a fundamental transformation with the rise of e-commerce-based brands and direct to consumer distribution, which disrupted the traditional category dynamics and drove the majority of category growth (versus traditional mattress companies) for several years. Today, the U.S. mattress industry has rebalanced to be comprised of vendors that rely on retail distribution as well as a consolidated number of direct-to-consumer retailers who have tried to expand brick and mortar distribution to capture more market share in a category still tied to instore product trials. Amidst this changing category dynamic, Purple’s manufacturing capabilities paired with our strategic mix of showrooms, e-commerce and third-party retailers, has allowed us to gain share and be a leader in the sleep products category.



In general, new direct to consumer mattress companies offer convenience, free shipping and returns, and low prices, while leveraging third-party manufacturing and distribution. Materials used by online mattress retailers include layers of foam cushioning that are assembled, compressed and folded into a box for distribution. This market is highly fragmented, commoditized and competitive, with customer purchase decisions based primarily on price. Prior to Purple, there has been little recent success disrupting the premium market, where the majority of category revenue and profit is realized. Competitors in the premium market include Tempur Sealy and Sleep Number.



While e-commerce home goods purchases have increased over the past five years, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers command a significant part of the market for mattress products. This part of the retail market is also highly fragmented and competitive. The leading brick-and-mortar specialty mattress retailers in the United States and Canada are, respectively, Mattress Firm and Sleep Country Canada, both of which Purple has significant partnerships with. These national retailers compete with both regional and local retailers as well as furniture and department stores. Purple has also expanded into many of these regional furniture retailers.



Across these channels, some key factors that impact competition in our industry include comfort feel, product features, reliable logistics and manufacturing capabilities, marketing efficacy and efficiency, brand differentiation, expertise of sales associates, customer care, pace of innovation and product roadmap, price of products and services, financial stability and ability to invest in innovation.

What Makes Purple Different? 



We believe we have a particular set of competitive strengths that differentiate and position us for continued success:




● | History of innovation that produced new comfort technology—We are a company built on innovation and licensing, with more than 30 years of expertise in comfort innovation. Purple is founded upon decades of history developing innovative comfort solutions, including the invention of our proprietary and patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. Our breakthrough mattress represents what we believe to be the first substantive innovation in the mattress industry since the introduction of memory foam in 1992. We believe that the unique properties of the Purple Grid enable several improvements to existing sleep products that are not addressed by foam, spring and air mattresses. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pressure Relief—The Purple Grid is designed around the science of column buckling which enables our mattresses to be both firm and soft. The Purple Grid offers support across the body’s larger surface areas, such as the back, while providing pressure relief at local areas or points of pressure, such as the hips and shoulders. We believe Purple’s founders were the first to leverage this technology in mattresses after its success in licensing its proprietary Purple Grid to medical manufacturers for use in wheelchairs, critical care beds and to this day, hospital beds. The resulting feel is often described as buoyant and responsive. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Temperature Neutral—The Hyper-Elastic Polymer material itself is temperature neutral, with the surface of the Purple Grid comprised mostly of air, made from thousands of open-air channels. The channels allow for high airflow and dissipation of heat and vapor. This is the opposite of foam beds, which absorb heat from the body and then radiate the heat back, constantly increasing the temperature. The Purple Grid allows for continual sleeping without waking up hot. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Responsive—Unlike memory foam, which compresses, gets hard and then takes time to recoil, the Purple Grid is instantly responsive to the body as it moves. It will immediately flex to support your position and spring back into place as you readjust during the night. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Durable—Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is a highly durable gel that we believe outlasts most foams by two to three times. The Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology also has numerous applications beyond mattress products including seat cushions, pillows, pet beds and beyond. The development of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is only one of numerous innovations we have developed to produce a range of unique and effective comfort products across the sleep, seat cushion and other categories. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary technologies and manufacturing expertise provide a significant competitive advantage—We believe the combination of patent protection, proprietary manufacturing equipment and decades of accumulated knowledge creates a competitive advantage through barriers to imitation. We have hundreds of granted or pending patents and hundreds of patent filings that cover current and future products as well as proprietary manufacturing equipment we have designed and fabricated. In addition to intellectual property protection of key products and manufacturing capabilities, our team has decades of experience and unique insights derived from inventing and refining proprietary comfort technologies, machines and products. Our Mattress Max machine, designed and built by Purple, allows for large-format injection molding of gels at scale. Not commercially available outside of Purple, this machine is essential in producing our proprietary products efficiently and at scale. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing a brand with a passionate following—Our brand mirrors our passion for uncompromising performance, quality and durability, and our dedication to improving lives by delivering better sleep and better comfort. We built our brand via a highly engaging digital marketing strategy, which rapidly grew our brand awareness to levels that we believe are very close to premium mattress category leaders in only five years. Our early brand growth was fueled by viral videos that have been seen more than 4.4 billion times across Facebook and YouTube. Our brand has extended beyond awareness of individual products and we have successfully marketed our full suite of products to customers using our DTC strategy. We believe customer satisfaction with our product has continued to drive “word of mouth” recommendation that is one of the most persuasive ways customers learn about our products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Balanced, omni-channel distribution strategy—We have sought opportunities to expand brand awareness in brick-and-mortar retailers where our beds can be displayed. This is a very different approach from most bed-in-a-box players who seek traditional consumer packaged goods distribution, e.g., boxes on shelves. Our goal is to support the customer wherever and however they want to learn, try, and buy. Whether in wholesale, Purple retail showrooms, or our e-commerce channel, we are a leader in the sleep products market. Our flexible return policies and aggressive expansion of wholesale doors and showrooms allow for more of our targeted customers to feel and experience our products throughout the purchase process. In our wholesale channel, we sell most of our products through select national and regional retailers as well as a variety of independent retail partners throughout the United States and Canada. As a result, we believe we are driving accelerated growth in the sleep products market as compared to the traditional retail sleep product industry.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vertical integration enables nimble design, development and execution—We design and develop our products in-house and we have extensive research and development capabilities led by a team of engineers, industrial designers and marketing specialists. The ability to develop and test products in this manner enables us to not only prototype and deploy new ideas, but also design and develop corresponding manufacturing equipment and processes. In addition, we continuously refine our production methods to improve product quality and enhance efficiency. The resulting real-time feedback cycle is a key differentiator compared to other competitors that outsource many of these functions and lack an integrated approach. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies 




● | Amplifying Purple Brand Power—We are building a differentiated brand and investing in brand demand-driving marketing and advertising to create awareness, engagement, and preference for the Purple brand and for our products across all our sales channels. This strategic focus and capability investment will support our growth plans in the wholesale channel, in Purple retail showrooms, and on Purple.com. We’ll also harness the evangelism of the ever-growing base of Purple owners whose advocacy of our products is one of the brand’s greatest strengths. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further direct-to-consumer growth and penetration—We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our brand, leading product portfolio, vertical integration and strong marketing capabilities to continue to attract new customers via our e-commerce channel. We have invested in substantial improvements to our website, enhancing the education, shopping, and buying experiences, and we have expanded our contact center, enabling live voice, chat and messaging with our sales associates which has driven higher customer satisfaction, higher average order value, and higher conversion. Continued successful execution on Purple.com supports planned e-commerce growth, and growth in all channels given the importance of the site during the customer decision journey. In addition, we currently operate 30 Company showrooms in cities across the U.S. where consumers can experience our brand, learn about and engage with our technology, and purchase our products. We anticipate continual expansion of our showrooms as we optimize the format. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded wholesale retail relationships—Expanding retail distribution of our products via new and existing arrangements represents an opportunity to tap into the large brick-and-mortar category of the sleep products market. We continue to have discussions with new retail partners to expand our wholesale footprint, as well as with existing retail partners to increase sales. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Existing product innovation—We have a rich history of product innovation and have developed core competencies in design, prototyping and manufacturing. This vertical integration enables us to continuously refine our existing products and manufacturing processes, as well as introduce new offerings, with the potential to attract new customers and drive repeat sales. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New product launches—We have a pipeline of future products we are developing. We are constantly exploring new technologies and ways to expand the benefits of our technologies through new product offerings. This includes innovations in mattresses beyond the Purple Grid, an expanded assortment based on the Harmony PillowTM that includes new patent-pending technology, other assortment expansion and new products in sleep, comfort and additional categories. In 2020, we added a children’s line of products, enabling us to sell to this underserved demographic and providing an additional opportunity to enter the home. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International expansion—We believe there is a substantial opportunity for international expansion, and we expect to find new opportunities as we expand into foreign markets. We entered the Canada market in Q4 2020 via the wholesale retailer Sleep Country Canada and we plan to expand in other foreign markets in the future. We believe that our differentiated products, multi-channel distribution strategy, manufacturing capabilities, vertical integration and marketing expertise will enable us to successfully enter new markets. We are exploring opportunities for international expansion in areas such as marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, as well as increasing franchise and wholesale partners.

Technology 



Technology is key to our unique position within the comfort industry. With our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer material used in the Purple Grid, we have introduced the first major innovation to the mattress category in decades. Mattresses from our competitors are typically manufactured using one or more layers of springs, standard polyurethane foam, memory foam, air chambers or latex foam. These technologies have existed for decades and are undifferentiated from competitors within their product type.
Proprietary Technologies 



The Purple innovation team, through their scientific journey to get to the root causes of pressure sores, designed the Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, Purple Grid structure, and other proprietary comfort technologies in order to improve the lives of “every body.” Each different cushioning product line requires unique molding techniques.



Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is non-toxic and hypoallergenic. This proprietary material is also durable and will not develop body impressions (compression set) from use over time. It is elastic and can stretch up to 15 times its original size and return without losing its shape. It sleeps and sits temperature-neutral and has good ventilation to inhibit moisture build-up.



Our Purple Grid structure made with Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is both soft and supportive. While the columns in this structure provide support where it is needed, they also buckle where it is needed to reduce pressure by allowing shoulders and hips to sink into the cushion with reduced force pushing back on those areas of the body unlike other cushion technologies. The soft and flexible columns also return to their original position as forces lessen and are capable of immediately providing support.



Proprietary Machinery 



Internally designed, developed and built, our Mattress Max machines are the only machines able to mold our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material into large-format king-sized mattresses at scale. We have modified other molding machines to manufacture additional products containing Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, such as pillows and seat cushions. The process of molding our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material using our Mattress Max machinery is proprietary, patent-protected and complex, requiring specific knowledge and expertise to successfully execute manufacturing. We have vertically integrated with our own machine shop with mechanics and engineers at each of our factories to maintain our machines and other equipment. Furthermore, we have extensive in-house fabrication capabilities, which enable us to design, manufacture, install and maintain new equipment as well as optimize the performance and efficiency of our existing machinery based on real-time insights gained from our vertically integrated operations.
Marketing 



We have developed a brand that resonates with consumers. Our marketing efforts are focused on building awareness of the Purple brand and illustrating the unique way our products deliver better sleep and comfort. We leverage data-driven marketing across all communication channels to engage, acquire, and retain customers. We also amplify the voices of our evangelical product owners, whose word-of-mouth recommendation is one of our most powerful (and ownable) marketing vehicles. Deep engagement with current customers enables us to increase additional product sales across our portfolio of offerings. The success we have achieved through our marketing campaigns has been key to rapidly building our branding and awareness.Our Sales Channels 



Historically, the majority of our sales have been through our e-commerce platform; however, we are growing our Purple retail showrooms, and expanding our wholesale channel distribution.



Direct-to-Consumer Channel 



E-commerce is a primary distribution channel and a critical hub for consumer engagement and education. We have benefitted from the rapid growth of the direct-to-consumer mattress industry in addition to our differentiated product offering and unique marketing campaigns. Consumer willingness to buy sleep products online continues to grow as consumer confidence in online shopping continues to increase. We sell directly to consumers through our website and our growing customer contact center. We help customers easily engage in relevant content, research our solutions, transact online and find support. We believe our online experience expands our brand and connections with consumers, enabling deeper awareness, engagement and brand loyalty. We believe our 100-night trial along with free shipping and free returns provides confidence to consumers in buying a mattress.




6







We operate 30 Purple retail showrooms in cities across the United States where consumers can experience our brand, learn and engage with our technology and purchase our products. We plan to continue expanding our showroom footprint across the United States.



Wholesale Channel 



We sell our assortment of products through brick-and-mortar wholesale partners. We began selling mattresses and other sleep products through our largest wholesale partner, Mattress Firm, in November 2017 and have continued to expand the number of wholesale partners where our mattresses and other sleep products are sold. We now sell mattresses through Ashley Furniture, Big Sandy, City Furniture, Furniture Row, HOM Furniture, Macy’s, Mathis Brothers, Mattress Firm, Raymour& Flanigan, Rooms To Go, Sleep County Canada and Steinhafels, among others. We typically have three to four mattress models on the floor. Sales associates have been trained and we believe are effective in educating consumers regarding our unique benefits as well as shifting the mix upward to our more premium and higher-margin mattresses. We expect to continue expanding brick-and-mortar wholesale partners to give our customers the opportunity to feel the difference of the Purple Grid for themselves.
Operations 



Factories, Supply Chain and Manufacturing 



We operate factories in Alpine, Utah, Grantsville, Utah and McDonough, Georgia, which manufacture and distribute Purple products. Our two factories in Utah have a total of 667,000 square-feet, including approximately 574,000 square-feet at our Grantsville factory and another 93,000 square-feet at our Alpine factory. Our factory in McDonough, Georgia opened in March 2021 and provides 844,000 square-feet to service our customers on the east coast. At these factories we manufacture our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer and Purple Grid cushioning used in our mattress, pillow and seat cushion products. We also assemble, package and ship our products from these facilities. We continually improve our manufacturing processes and create efficiencies in production through new equipment and process designs and resources. We believe these factories will provide ample room to accommodate our future growth and expansion plans for the near term.



We outsource and resell other products, including adjustable bases, platform bases, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and duvets. These products are either designed in-house or in partnership and are unique to Purple.



We have relationships with multiple suppliers for our outsourced products and components. These suppliers may be interchanged in order to maintain quality, cost and delivery expectations.



Environmental and Governmental Regulation 



We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection and other laws and regulations applicable to the sleep product industry. These laws and regulations vary among the states and countries in which we do and intend to do business. For example, in the United States, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies that restrict the generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and waste. We are also subject to laws such as the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Our mattress products are also subject to fire-retardant standards developed by the State of California, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other jurisdictions where we sell these products.



As a retailer of sleep and cushioning products, we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to retailers generally, including those regulations governing the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of our e-commerce activities. We are also subject to import and export laws and regulations to the extent our products and their component parts cross international boundaries. Many of these laws and regulations are consumer-focused and pertain to safety, truth-in-advertising, promotional offers, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements and similar requirements.



It is our policy and practice to comply with all applicable domestic and foreign laws and regulations. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures necessary to comply with these laws and regulations. These expenditures have been immaterial to our financial results. We have not suffered a material adverse effect from non-compliance with federal, state, local or foreign legislation, but there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such legislation in the future.

Human Capital



Employees 



Our most valuable asset at Purple is our people and their learned institutional knowledge. We are mission-driven by our commitment to innovating real comfort solutions that meaningfully help “every body” feel and live better. We are a product innovation company at our core.



In February 2022, we completed a restructuring of our workforce that was necessitated by a realignment of our cost structure. As a result of the realignment and restructuring, we reduced employee headcount by approximately 15% and incurred a restructuring charge of $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2022. As of March 1, 2022, we have approximately 1,800 employees engaged in manufacturing, research and development, general corporate functions and in Purple retail showrooms.



During 2021, the Company’s top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current employee population works primarily within our two factories in Utah, our one factory in Georgia and at our headquarters in Lehi, Utah. However, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, employees who were working in office settings have been working from home. We also identified new ways to work safely and effectively in our manufacturing areas by creating additional shifts, regularly cleaning common areas, wearing face masks and ensuring employees were practicing safe social distancing. We regularly engage labor contracting agencies and independent contractors to accelerate our progress and to provide support across various functions within our organization. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.



Diversity and Inclusion



Purple is committed to fostering an environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where employees feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully engage their talents and training in their work, while generating personal satisfaction in their roles within the Company. We hired a Chief People Officer in 2021, who will facilitate the ways in which Purple can operationalize its commitment to expanding diversity, nurturing the power of difference, and recruiting and retaining diverse talent.
Philanthropy



Purple is driven to innovate real comfort solutions that help “every body” sleep, feel and live better while we forge real relationships with our customers and communities. We believe in the importance of contributing to the communities that we serve, and we are growing the impact of our philanthropic activities with a purposeful focus on protecting the power of sleep for children and families. We expanded this year our support of the Precious Dreams Foundation to help assure the comfort and sleep of children in foster care. We made product donations to shelters in the communities in which we live and work, and we supported the sleep of refugee families resettling in the United States. We are proud to celebrate student achievement and recognize teacher contributions and to support the local economies in communities that support our workplaces.

Ethical Culture



Finally, our Code of Ethics promotes an environment of integrity by requiring honest, ethical and fair conduct with a focus on conflicts of interest, compliance, deterrence and internal reporting. It also requires full, fair and accurate disclosure in public filings and communications. All employees are required to complete Code of Ethics training periodically.



Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating to our inability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see section titled Risk Factors.



Our History 



Purple was created by two brothers that set out to revolutionize the comfort space. One in manufacturing and design, and the other an advanced aerospace scientist, the brothers embarked on a partnership in the early 1990s to put together a team to develop cushioning solutions for wheelchairs and medical beds. They later created what we call the Purple Grid—an elastomeric polymer that can stretch up to 15x its resting size and never lose shape or function. The Purple Grid has since been used in mattresses, seat cushions and pillows.




In August of 2020, Purple announced that co-founders Terry and Tony Pearce chose to retire from their positions as Co-Directors of Research & Development of Purple LLC and as directors on Purple Inc.’s Board of Directors (“Board”). Today, Purple’s research and development teams are focused on creating innovative comfort solutions for all facets of life.
