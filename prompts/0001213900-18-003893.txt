Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
We are an internet based direct response marketing company that in-licenses, acquires or creates innovative and proprietary products that can be sold to consumers around the world via our technology infrastructure and relationships with agencies, third party marketers, and online advertising platforms such as Facebook and Google. We currently have two commercial stage products and intend to launch an additional four products in 2018. Our leading product, launched in the second quarter of 2017, is a patented shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in foamer for thicker, fuller hair. Our second product, launched in the first quarter of 2018, is a nutritional supplement for immune support.
 
We launched our online direct marketing business in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the establishment of a partnership with Inate Skincare, LLC (“Inate”). Our initial intention was to launch a skin care line containing our proprietary ingredients and to market such products directly to consumers. The Company entered into a limited liability company operating agreement with its joint venture partners with respect to Inate under the legal name Immudyne PR LLC (“Immudyne PR”). On April 1, 2016, the original operating agreement of Immudyne PR was amended and restated and we increased our ownership and voting interest in Immudyne PR to 78.16667%.
 
Divestiture of Yeast Beta Glucan Business
 
Throughout 2017, we manufactured, distributed and sold natural immune support products containing our proprietary yeast beta glucans, a group of beta glucans naturally occurring in the cell walls of yeast that have been shown through testing and analysis to support the immune system. Beta glucans, or β-Glucans, are a natural extract that are considered to be “biological response modifiers” that support the immune system. The most common sources of beta glucans are from the cell walls of baker’s yeast, the cellulose in plants, the bran of cereal grains and certain fungi and bacteria.
In 2017, our yeast beta glucan nutraceutical and cosmetic product lines consisted of our natural, premium yeast beta glucans in oral and topical applications. We offered our yeast beta glucans as natural raw material ingredients in bulk quantities, our “Nutraceutical and Cosmetic Additives” segment, and finished, consumer products packaged under our brands as well as private label brands, our “Finished Cosmetic Products” segment, which were marketed directly to consumers.
 
In the first quarter of 2018 we sold assets and certain liabilities related to our legacy business that manufactured raw yeast beta glucan. As a result of this divestiture, we solely operate our online direct marketing business owned by Immudyne PR.
 
Our Current Products 
 
We currently have 2 commercial stage products and 2 development stage product in our portfolio. We have several additional products that we intend to in-license in 2018, subject to negotiations and definitive agreements. Generally, our business model is to license or acquire innovative products that address large, global unmet needs which can be placed onto our internet based or “online” direct response marketing platform. All of our products are proprietary and exclusively marketed by Immudyne and our partners. We seek to protect the market position of our products with intellectual property, trade secrets, trademarks and brand equity.
 
Shapiro MD
 
The Shapiro MD product line is a unique hair care aid developed to help men & women regain thicker, fuller and healthier looking hair. Shapiro MD Shampoo & Conditioner are the result of 15 years of research and development by thought-leading dermatologists Dr. Steven Shapiro and Dr. Michael Borenstein.

The Shapiro MD product line is protected by two U.S. patents and contains three naturally-occurring dihydrotestosterone (DHT) blocking ingredients.  DHT is widely believed to be the main culprit of balding/hair-loss. Clinical research on the ingredients used in Shapiro MD products has been published in prominent scientific journals, including US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, International Journal of Dermatology and European Hair Research Society. 
 
iNR Wellness
 
iNR Wellness is a daily nutritional supplement that contains yeast, oat, and mushroom beta glucans. Beta glucans, or β-Glucans, are a natural extract considered to be “biological response modifiers” that support the immune system. Our three naturally occurring beta glucans have clinically shown to support the human immune system and are commonly used as an OTC supplement to reduce cholesterol levels, manage blood glucose levels, and support the immune system.
 
General scientific research on beta glucan derived from yeast cell walls has been conducted in recent years by renowned medical laboratories, including Baylor College of Medicine, U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Institute, Stanford University, Southwest Research Institute, and North Carolina State University. As more studies are conducted on beta glucans, we believe the potential benefits to human health will continue to emerge.
 
Although the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has historically endorsed the consumption of oat glucan/dietary fiber as an aid to lower cholesterol, most of the testing and analysis or scientific research mentioned in this annual report has not been subject to oversight of the FDA or any comparable regulatory body, and no regulatory body has attested to the efficacy of beta glucans in supporting the immune system or otherwise treating disease. Further, the marketing of beta glucans is not subject to FDA approval, and we are prohibited by Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and FDA regulations from suggesting in advertisements and product labels that our products mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of disease.
 
Scarology
 
Scarology is a scar healing topical solution delivered through a day and night routine. Three essential ingredients work together to achieve dramatic results in appearance and feel. The product is clinically tested and developed by prominent dermatologists. We expect the Scarology product launch in the second quarter of 2018. 
 
None of the testing and analysis or scientific research mentioned in this annual report on Form 10-K has been subject to the oversight of the FDA or any comparable regulatory body, and no regulatory body has attested to the efficacy of our products. Further, our current products are marketed as cosmetics and nutritional supplements, and we are prohibited by FTC and FDA regulations from suggesting in advertisements and product labels that our products mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a specific disease or class of disease.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy primarily consists of utilizing our online direct response platform technology to sell the innovative products that we have licensed, acquired or created. Our priority is to build brand recognition across our product lines and actively pursue opportunities to market our products and increase sales.
 
We leverage the world’s largest social media and online sales platforms such as Google, Facebook and Amazon to capture customers and market health and wellness products globally. Additionally, we sell our products through our own websites at www.inrwellness.com and www.shapiromd.com.
 
Our expertise in digital marketing allows us to target consumers most likely to purchase our products, serve these consumers an advertisement, and convert these consumers into customers. We plan to combine this highly scalable paid media business model with other direct to consumer approaches such as television, radio and influencer marketing. We also intend to sell our products in retail stores and through physician offices.

Manufacturing 
 
We use third party contractors for the manufacturing, encapsulation, bottling and labeling of our personal care and nutritional supplement products. These contractors are certified to produce organic products, subject to regular government inspections, and to the best of our knowledge, comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices and hold the necessary drug manufacturing licenses and processed food registrations required by their respective state regulators.
Customers
 
We sell our products directly to consumers internationally through online channels. Over 90% of consolidated 2017 sales consisted of customers in the U.S. Penetrating international markets is a significant opportunity for the Company’s near-term growth.
 
Our priority is to maximize the long-term value of each customer through proper pricing strategies, retargeting, customer service and through database management. We have served over 50,000 customers since implementing direct selling strategies into our business model in 2016.
 
One customer, M.M.P., accounted for 25% of net sales during 2017.
 
Competition
 
The markets for nutritional supplements and skin care products are highly competitive, consisting of a large number of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. The Company's competitors include, among others, Guthy Renker LLC, L'Oréal S.A., Atlantic Coast Media Group, LLC, Hims, Inc. and The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have a longer operating history, higher visibility and brand recognition, and greater financial resources than we do. 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely primarily on proprietary trade secrets and know-how to operate our online direct response marketing platform. We have two U.S. patents relating to our Shapiro MD products’ method for treatment of hair loss with a combination of natural ingredients.
 
In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants and vendors to contractually protect such information.
 
Governmental and Environmental Regulation 
 
Our business and the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our beta glucan products are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the FDA and the FTC.
 
The FDA enforces the FDCA and Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (“DSHEA”) as they pertain to foods, food ingredients, cosmetics and dietary supplement production and marketing. Dietary supplements and nutraceuticals are regulated as a category of food, not as drugs. We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws.
 
The FDA imposes GMP guidelines to ensure that dietary supplements are produced in a quality manner, do not contain contaminants or impurities and are accurately labeled. GMPs include requirements for establishing quality control procedures, designing and constructing manufacturing plants, testing ingredients and finished products and record keeping and handling of consumer product complaints. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements and cosmetics, including the power to monitor claims made in product labeling, to seize adulterated or misbranded products or unapproved new drugs, to request product recall, to enjoin further manufacture or sale of a product, to issue warning letters and to institute criminal proceedings.

Advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of products are also regulated by the FTC. The FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements and other health-related products to ensure that any advertising is truthful and not misleading, and that an advertiser maintains adequate substantiation for all product claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
 
Under current U.S. regulations, our products must comply with certain labeling requirements enforced by the FDA and FTC, but otherwise generally are not required to receive regulatory approval prior to introduction into the U.S. market. We believe we are in compliance with all material government regulations applicable to our products.
 
In addition to the foregoing, our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled, and our relationship with our employees is subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We currently do not incur any material costs in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental laws as our manufacturing processes generate minimal discharge. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining compliance with applicable environmental laws has not, and we believe, in the future, will not, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material governmental regulations applicable to our operations.
