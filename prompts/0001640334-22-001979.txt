ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview

History

GPO Plus, Inc. (the “Company”) is a corporation originally established under the name of Koldeck, Inc. under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on March 29, 2016. 

On April 2, 2018, the Company approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Koldeck Inc. to Global House Holdings Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary Global House Holdings Ltd., a Nevada corporation. Koldeck Inc. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name Global House Holdings Ltd. The name change, as well as a 20:1 forward stock split, was approved by FINRA and effective April 3, 2018.

On June 19, 2020, the Company approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Global House Holdings Ltd. to GPO Plus, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary GPO Plus, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Global House Holdings Ltd. remained the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name GPO Plus, Inc. The name change, as well as a 12:1 reverse stock split, was approved by FINRA and effective August 20, 2020. All share amounts in this Report reflect the reverse stock split.

We are a start-up company engaged in the business of organizing, promoting, and operating industry-specific group purchase organizations (GPOs). A GPO is an entity created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors.

Effective May 5, 2020, Brett H. Pojunis acquired 5,000,000 (post-split) of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from Jian Han Chen. As a result of the transaction, Mr. Pojunis had voting and dispositive control over 53.67% of our outstanding voting securities. The shares were acquired in a private transaction using Mr. Pojunis’ personal funds. Mr. Pojunis’s ownership has since been diluted to 23.01%, and Mr. Chen no longer holds any equity interest in our Company.

Concurrently with the above-described change in control, Mr. Chen resigned as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and director of the Company, and Chun Hao Chen resigned as the Secretary of the Company. Having consented to act as sole officer and director of the Company, Mr. Pojunis was appointed to fill the ensuing vacancies.

On June 11, 2020, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of twelve (12) old shares for one (1) new share. Also, on June 11, 2020, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger for the purposes of changing our corporate name from Global House Holdings Ltd. to GPO Plus, Inc.

The 1 for 12 reverse split, merger, name and symbol change became effective at the open of business on August 20, 2020. As a result of the reverse stock split, our authorized capital decreased from 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock to 125,000,000 shares of common stock. Correspondingly, our issued and outstanding capital decreased from 111,800,000 shares of common stock to 9,316,664 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares remains unchanged. The reverse split is payable upon surrender and no fractional shares were issued. Fractional shares were be rounded up. Pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, our Company merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary GPO Plus, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Global House Holdings Ltd. remains the surviving company of the merger, continuing under the name GPO Plus, Inc.

As a result of the corporate actions, effective August 20, 2020, the new CUSIP identifier for our common shares became 38402T100 and our ticker symbol changed to GHHHD. After 20 business days, our symbol changed to GPOX.

On July 31, 2020 we announced the launch of cbdGPO, www.cbdGPO.com, a group purchasing organization (GPO) for the CBD and hemp industry, and the establishment of a sales office for cbdGPO in Hernando Beach, Florida. The announcement was made in connection with the abandonment of our former business, and our plan to establish and operate GPOs to services a variety of industries. A GPO is an entity that is created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors based on the collective buying power of the GPO members. Through cbdGPO, we will seek to make the process of ordering premium CBD products fast, simple, reliable, and affordable. cbdGPO and GPO Plus, Inc. are brokers and do not take possession of CBD products.

On August 19, 2020, we entered into a Designated Territory Distribution Agreement with SafeHandles LLC (“SafeHandles”). SafeHandles is a California based creator and supplier of certain products known as SafeHandles®, which include antimicrobial sleeves, Ster-Roll™ Tape, ADA adhesive products, and other related accessories. Pursuant to the agreement, SafeHandles has appointed the Company as the exclusive distributor of its product in the states of Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, and for the gaming industry. The Company will also hold non-exclusive distribution rights outside the territory.

Our Current Business

As used in this report, “we,” “our,” “us” and similar pronouns refer to GPO Plus, Inc. and our operating divisions, unless the context requires otherwise. We are a start-up company engaged in the business of organizing, promoting, and operating industry-specific group purchase organizations (GPOs). A GPO is an entity created to leverage the purchasing power of a group of businesses (or individuals) to obtain discounts from vendors.

6


GPO Plus identifies underserved markets, segments and industries where there is little to no competition and develops specific GPOs around them. In addition, unlike major GPOs, GPO Plus has low MOQ’s (minimum order quantities) which enable small and mid-sized companies to participate with larger corporations. We communicate with our members to determine their needs to ensure GPO Plus provides relevant products and services, sustainable low prices and cost structures, increased efficiencies, and attentive customer service.

GPO Plus develops industry specific GPOs that leverage the aggregated purchasing power of its members. The GPOs use collective buying power to obtain and negotiate discounts on products and services from vendors. The discounted rates are then shared with its members saving them money and time by also improving supply chain efficiencies.

Principal Products or Services and their Markets

The Company is comprised of HealthGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the Healthcare industry, cbdGPO, a Group Purchasing Organization for the hemp industry. DISTRO+, our distribution division and GPO for specialty retailers, and Nutriumph® Supplements, an innovative supplement company whose mission is to offer premium nutraceuticals to assist consumers to reach their health and wellness goals with natural ingredients. In addition, GPOPlus offers professional services through GPOPRO Services.

HealthGPO

HealthGPO is a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) for healthcare related products and services for the emerging alternative market. Our target members are in and around the healthcare industry that include hospitals, medical practice groups, laboratories, and professional physicians as well as entities not directly related to healthcare such as general businesses and governmental agencies. We intend to save our members money by aggregating purchases, negotiating with vendors, and sharing discounts. We aim to save our members time and alleviate headaches by streamlining orders and offering integrated solutions leading to considerable supply chain efficiencies.

What We Do

Aggregate, Negotiate + Share


· | Aggregate - HealthGPO aggregates the purchasing power of our members. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Negotiate - We use the collective buying power to negotiate discounts.
· | Share - The discounts are shared with our members to save them money. 


HealthGPO leverages the aggregated purchasing power of our members. They use collective buying power to obtain and negotiate discounts on products and services from vendors. The discounted rates are then shared with its members saving them money and time by also improving supply chain efficiencies.

Products and Services

HealthGPO works with companies that have well priced high-quality products and services with advantageous terms. Our primary offerings are volume supply acquisitions, access to quality personal protective equipment (PPE), essential necessities and medical equipment from non-traditional, yet fully accredited suppliers. Additionally, we identify “best of breed” products that have a unique value proposition and become distributors with some form of exclusivity and/or favorable terms. HealthGPO is developing a b2b healthcare portal to offer medical products to everyday business. Technology will continue to play an important role in exceeding our stated goals.

HealthGPO also addresses the needs of individual consumers who want access to products at a good price that are typically only available to healthcare professionals. We intend on developing a b2c (business to consumer) portal to sell healthcare and wellness products directly to consumers.

On August 19, 2020, we entered into a Designated Territory Distribution Agreement with SafeHandles LLC (“SafeHandles”). Pursuant to that agreement, we have acquired the right to distribute the SafeHandles® line of anti-microbial products, which include antimicrobial sleeves, Ster-Roll™ Tape, ADA adhesive products, and other related accessories.

SafeHandlesTM are shrunk to fit, adhesive antimicrobial film covers that are designed to fit over common touch-points, such as door handles, push plates and hand railings. SafeHandles film contains a slow-release, silver-based pesticide that is registered and approved by the EPA to inhibit the growth of certain microbes, including damaging bacteria, mold, mildew, and fungi. SafeHandles films are fundamentally cleaner and more durable than untreated handles, so they are ideal for use in high-traffic environments where cleanliness is critical, where users need to eliminate filthy handles. SafeHandles is a proven technology that is trusted for high-traffic areas found in schools and businesses across the United States to supplement their standard hygiene procedures.

Approved Suppliers

Our suppliers are critical to our goal of delivering products and services that meet our members’ ever-evolving needs. By securing access to a robust and dynamic portfolio of products, and maintaining the highest standards of customer care and service, HealthGPO will offer differentiated, high-quality group purchasing and consulting services to help our members lower costs.
HealthGPO’s Business Model

HealthGPO is committed to becoming an alternative option for all the needs of today’s healthcare industry. As demand increases for medical products, HealthGPO is responding by offering discounts (usually substantial discounts) on quality products with small minimum order quantities (“MOQ’s”). Our business presents to the marketplace an increasing number of offerings across the broad spectrum of medical supplies, including emerging medical and preventative products that have unique value propositions.
Membership

HealthGPO is developing for the future a tiered, fee-based membership structure for our prospective members. Members will be entitled to receive priority services and benefits according to their membership tier. We expect to finalize and implement our planned membership structure during 2021. Fees and benefits will be assessed and adjusted on an ongoing basis to optimize our supply chain and meet the needs of our members. Participation in HealthGPO will be on a trial basis until our membership structure is finalized.

Problems

Current domestic market conditions illustrate how medical supplies have become increasingly more expensive. Product quality ranges drastically due to relaxed regulatory standards, and suppliers that require high MOQs, which force businesses to make sizable investments in product purchases. Front-line management face overpowering competition, leaving established organizations to dominate the marketplace and dictate the pricing. These businesses must also compete with the government.

Crisis also breeds opportunity which, unfortunately, is not always honorable or altruistic. There are those who have ulterior motives, driven more by profit than service or quality. Businesses who are unfamiliar with the struggles this sector may face challenges in being able to easily evaluate products and services among the widely divergent choices available. HealthGPO seeks to make this process easier by identifying viable options for our members and, we hope, adding protections against these challenges.

Solutions

Through innovative strategies, technology, and key relationships within the healthcare industry, HealthGPO utilizes the power of Group Purchasing for the exclusive benefit of our members. HealthGPO brings new solutions to businesses and established healthcare companies seeking alternatives to enter into or expand in the industry. HealthGPO provides new sources of discounted, non-traditional, yet fully approved and vetted materials as required, products that have a unique value proposition, and a wide range of business consulting services for new and existing businesses.

This will also include focused concentration on supply chain optimization. Our members will be able to get the products and services they need, when they need them and at a price they can afford.

Opportunity

An alternative market has been emerging due to the increased mandated compliance with public health standards and procedures in response to the global pandemic. Government workers, non-healthcare commercial buildings, and general businesses now have a need for medical and protective equipment as well as having to perform continuous disinfecting procedures. Certain businesses are providing customers common PPE items such as hand sanitizers, protective masks, and gloves.

HealthGPO potential market is vast. In addition to traditional healthcare companies, there is also the new emerging market which includes, but is not limited to, convenience stores, hotels, strip mall stores, restaurants, etc. The different businesses in this emerging alternative market have a need for additional services, medical equipment, and PPE products. Previously, existing GPOs wouldn’t consider servicing these kinds of businesses and presumably couldn’t facilitate the new demand. In certain cases, healthcare GPOs’ internal governance prohibits them from working with companies that are not in the healthcare industry.

Many companies have been affected by reduced cash-flow and now face additional costs and challenges to stay in business and also be compliant. To meet the needs of our members, HealthGPO makes purchasing necessary products and essential supplies easy and affordable. Furthermore, due to the relationships with its vendors, HealthGPO has unique access to “in demand” products that other organizations may not have, and cannot get, access to.

cbdGPO

cbdGPO will employ an operating structure and strategy similar to HealthGPO to provide an alternative procurement option to the hemp industry. As demand for hemp products continues to increase and cbdGPO will aim to offer quality proven products at discounted rates without having to place substantial orders. To that end, they plan to offer a wide range of products and services to meet the needs of their members.

GPO Plus created the first hemp/CBD Group Purchasing Organization in order to extend large volume pricing of hemp products and raw materials to small quantity buyers, allowing them to get the highest quality products at bulk pricing discounts without minimum order quantities.

cbdGPO is a membership-based buying group to help hemp companies including wholesalers, manufacturers, distributors and labs realize savings and efficiencies by aggregating purchasing volume and using that leverage to negotiate discounts with manufacturers, distributors, and other vendors. We foresee that cbdGPO will allow wholesalers and other hemp companies to obtain the best quality consistent products at the best value.

Membership

cbdGPO is developing a tiered, fee-based membership structure for its prospective members. Members will be entitled to receive priority services and benefits according to their membership tier. We expect to finalize and implement our planned membership structure during 2022. Fees and benefits will be assessed and adjusted on an ongoing basis to optimize the supply chain and meet the needs of its members. Participation in cbdGPO will be on a trial basis until the membership structure is finalized.

Following the Federal legalization of hemp products in the United States, there is an overwhelming demand for high quality hemp products for both consumers as well as businesses looking to break into this lucrative industry. cbdGPO intends to ensure that its suppliers deliver safe, cost-effective hemp products to its members.

Purchasing Strategy and Request for Proposal Process

cbdGPO’s purpose is to help future members to realize savings and efficiencies by aggregating purchasing volume and using that leverage to negotiate discounts with manufacturers, distributors, and other vendors. We seek to offer members the best products at the best value with approved suppliers.
Approved Suppliers

cbdGPO suppliers will manufacture and produce raw materials (isolate and distillate) and/or white label and private label hemp products. They only partner with licensed hemp suppliers, preferred vendors, manufacturers, and/or agents of cbdGPO.

All suppliers have been and will continue to be thoroughly vetted by cbdGPO. Vetting procedure may include, without limitation, site inspection(s), independent testing, and corporate background checks. Suppliers must be compliant with all applicable federal and state regulations. Approved suppliers must produce a complete chain of product custody (including all Certificates of Authenticity (“COA”) from the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) approved labs) and confirm all manufacturing of products are conducted in Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) inspected and approved facilities.

DISTRO+

DISTRO+ is a Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) and distributor of premium products for the emerging specialty retailer sector and wholesalers. Through the power of Group Purchasing, DISTRO+ offers its network of customers (we call them “Members”) competitive pricing with low MOQs that realize similar discounts as major retailers with large buying power.
The purpose of the Phase One launch is to introduce DISTRO+ to our network with 3 goals;


1. | enter into distribution agreements with brands,
---+------------------------------------------------
2. | sign up retailers as Members, and 
3. | identify distributors we can acquire. 


1. Distribution Agreements. DISTRO+ is developing a portfolio of “best in class” high-quality innovative and fully compliant products representing numerous brands spanning multiple categories with a focus on hemp-derived CBD packaged goods (and other hemp-derived cannabinoids), vaping/smoking hardware and accessories, and other products + services that benefit our Members.

2. Sign Up Members. DISTRO+’s Members represent specialty retailers, online stores, and wholesalers organized into the following categories: Convenience / C-Stores, Counter Culture Specialty Stores, Department Stores, Grocery and Pharmacies, Health and Wellness Stores, and Wholesalers. To help our Members grow their business and streamline purchasing, DISTRO+ developed a robust technology platform and a Membership Portal. Members have no-cost access to affordable pricing with a suite of tools to simplify purchases, review transactional history, shop from our product catalogs, manage payment methods, and more!

3. Vertical Roll-up Strategy. DISTRO+ intends on scaling quickly by executing its vertical roll-up strategy to attract independent and regional distributors and consolidate them under DISTRO+. To achieve this, DISTRO+ will provide the resources and credibility needed for these organizations to maximize revenue potential through economies of scale of Group Purchasing.

Competition and Competitive Strategy

Competition

The group purchasing marketplace remains one of the fastest growing industries in the country. Group purchasing is used in many industries to purchase raw materials and supplies, but it is also a common practice in the grocery, healthcare, electronics, industrial manufacturing and agricultural industries. In recent years, group purchasing has also begun to take root in the nonprofit community. In the healthcare field, GPOs have most commonly been accessed by acute-care organizations, but non-profit Community Clinics and Health Centers throughout the U.S. have also been engaging in group purchasing.

Some of the companies holding the largest market share in the Healthcare related Group Purchasing Organizations industry include:


· | Premier, Inc. NASDAQ: PINC (Charlotte, N.C.) Premier, Inc. (“Premier”) is a leading healthcare improvement company, uniting an alliance of more than 4,000 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 175,000 other providers and organizations to transform healthcare. With integrated data and analytics, collaboratives, supply chain solutions, and consulting and other services, Premier enables better care and outcomes at a lower cost. 3,000 hospitals and 110,000 other healthcare providers. In addition to leveraging contracts for its member providers, Premier also has a clinical database containing information on approximately $41 billion in annual purchasing data, approximately 2.5 million real-time daily clinical transactions and data on one third of discharges nationwide.

· | MedAssets (Alpharetta, Ga.) - 4,400 hospitals and 122,000 non-acute healthcare providers. MedAssets is an exclusively healthcare-focused GPO that serves four out of five hospitals in the U.S. The GPO manages more than $50 billion in supply expense, $2.5 billion in labor expense and $365 billion in gross revenue on behalf of its clients. 


While the market health industry GPOs are well established, GPO participation in the emerging hemp industries is in its infancy. Certain refined and unrefined hemp-derived products are presently offered by a small number of generalized healthcare and agricultural group purchasers; however, no GPO has emerged as a dominant market presence to meet the needs of the growing global hemp market.

Competitive Strategy

As a start-up provider of GPOs and related services, we plan on establishing our competitive position by leveraging industry relationships, utilizing superior market research and having operational flexibility and marketing strategies tailored to new and developing markets in the healthcare and hemp industries.
Marketing Strategy

We plan to market our services through a variety of channels including industry targeted print advertising campaigns, email, and telephone-focused direct marketing. We also intend to establish a network of sales offices in major industry centers. In July 2020, we established our first sales office in Florida. We will seek to develop alliances with key industry organizations in order to access the broadest possible range of industry participants. Attending major industry conferences and tradeshows will increase our visibility in the markets from which we intend to draw our membership base.
