ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
Welbilt, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2015, is one of the world's leading commercial foodservice equipment companies. We design, manufacture and supply best-in-class food and beverage equipment for the global commercial foodservice market, offering customers unparalleled operator and patron insights, collaborative kitchen solutions, culinary expertise and world-class implementation support and service. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Welbilt, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively, are referred to as the "Company," "Welbilt," "we," "our" or "us."
We are headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, and operate 21 manufacturing facilities globally. We have a long history in the foodservice equipment manufacturing business with certain of our brands originating in the mid-1800's. Over time, we have become an industry-leading manufacturer of a full suite of commercial foodservice equipment supporting hot-side, cold-side and beverage dispensing capabilities. Our suite of products is used by commercial and institutional foodservice operators including full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurant ("QSR") chains, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, hospitals, schools and other institutions. 
On April 19, 2018, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Avaj International Holding AB ("Avaj"), whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Crem International Holding AB ("Crem"), develops, manufactures and markets a full suite of coffee machines under three brands: Coffee Queen®, Expobar® and Spengler for use in offices, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, catering and convenience stores. This acquisition provided us with an established presence in hot beverage equipment, a complementary product category, potential operational synergies and cross-selling benefits and an increased presence in Europe and Asia.
Today, we sell through a global network of over 5,000 distributors, dealers, buying groups and manufacturers' representatives. Our portfolio of 12 award-winning brands includes Cleveland™, Convotherm®, Crem®, Delfield®, Frymaster®, Garland®, Kolpak®, Lincoln™, Manitowoc® Ice, Merco®, Merrychef® and Multiplex®. These product brands are supported by three service brands: FitKitchen®, our fully-integrated kitchen systems brand, KitchenCare®, our aftermarket parts and service brand and KitchenConnect®, our cloud-based application brand. Our broad portfolio of foodservice equipment and services provides us with a balanced, diverse revenue base across geographies and foodservice product categories. Approximately 35-40% of our revenues are derived from the sale of cold category products, 40-45% from hot category products and approximately 15-20% from aftermarket parts and services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net sales of $1,590.1 million and earnings from operations of $216.8 million. 
Our global footprint positions us to capitalize on growth in both developed and emerging markets, as our full-line of hot and cold products and systems are sold in more than 100 countries globally. We report our operating results through three reportable segments: the Americas (includes United States ("U.S."), Canada and Latin America), EMEA (markets in Europe, including Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa) and APAC (principally comprised of markets in China, Australia, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and New Zealand). Based on sales by destination in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 37% of our net sales are generated outside the U.S. During such period, the majority of our revenue was derived from customers in the Americas at approximately 70%, with 19% from EMEA customers and 11% from APAC customers, after giving effect to the elimination of intersegment sales.
We intend to achieve sustainable growth globally and drive increased profitability by leveraging our position as a leading commercial foodservice equipment provider, while selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and partnerships, growing our customer base, expanding the frontiers of foodservice innovation and continuing to attract and grow industry-leading talent. We continue to explore acquisition opportunities that complement our product lines, allow us to expand our presence in international markets, enable us to leverage our distribution capabilities, provide us with selective technologies and/or otherwise support the expansion of our business in a manner that is consistent with our strategic goals. 
The superior quality and design of our foodservice equipment has long been recognized by third-parties. Welbilt products reflect a history of innovation, as evidenced through numerous awards across our product portfolio. For example, Welbilt has won 35 Kitchen Innovation Awards since 2005 from the National Restaurant Association. In 2018, the North American Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") awarded Welbilt, for the 9th time in a row, the ENERGY STAR Award as Partner of the Year for Sustained Excellence.
Our History
Our heritage in the industry stretches back over a century. In 1929, Henry and Alexander Hirsch established the Welbilt Stove Co., which acquired foodservice equipment companies like Garland and Cleveland that had a history dating as far back as the mid-1800's. Through a focus on research and development, innovation, and superior customer service, as well as strategic and transformational acquisitions, the Company over time became an industry-leading source for foodservice equipment. 
On October 27, 2008, our former parent, The Manitowoc Company, Inc. ("MTW") completed the acquisition of Enodis plc, a global leader in equipment manufacturing for the foodservice industry, for $2.7 billion. With this acquisition, the Company's portfolio expanded to include refrigeration, ice-making, cooking, food-prep, and beverage-dispensing technologies.

On January 29, 2015, MTW, announced plans to create two independent, public companies to separately operate its two businesses: its crane business and its foodservice business. To effect the separation, MTW first undertook an internal reorganization, following which MTW held the crane business and Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. held the foodservice business. On March 4, 2016, the Company spun off from MTW and publicly listed on the NYSE under the name Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. Effective March 6, 2017, we renamed the Company to Welbilt, Inc. and rebranded our logo and brand identity to Welbilt. This change was part of our strategic repositioning after we spun off from MTW on March 4, 2016 and represents a long-standing commitment to put customers’ needs first.
Key milestones in our history are depicted below.

We produce beverage dispensers, blended ice machines, ice/beverage dispensers, beer coolers, post-mix dispensing valves, backroom equipment and support system components and related equipment for use by QSR chains, convenience stores, bottling operations, movie theaters, and the soft-drink industry. We design, manufacture and sell ice machines under the Manitowoc and other brand names. Our coffee equipment is sold under the Coffee Queen, Expobar and Spengler brand names within the Crem family of brands, and other beverage and related products are sold under the Multiplex, Manitowoc and other brand names.


• | KitchenCare. We provide a full range of after-market parts and services and manage a comprehensive factory-authorized service network, assuring proper installation and start-up, preventative maintenance, spare parts supply and maximum customer uptime on all Welbilt appliances.

We take a holistic approach to innovation. By focusing on the below attributes, we offer products that incorporate industry-leading technology in the delivery of food, equipment sanitation, energy efficiency, reduced water usage, menu flexibility and mobile connectivity.

• | Productivity, Speed and Flexibility: Kitchens that occupy less space, have higher output and are easier to operate, are key to growth in the foodservice industry, particularly in urban locations. Greater speed and equipment flexibility also allow for higher productivity and a wider range of menu options. Innovative control systems can improve information flow in the kitchen by letting operators know what and when to cook, and how to maintain and clean the equipment. Advances in kitchen automation allow for significant increases in production effectiveness and efficiency as well as a reduction in labor costs.

-11-


• | Health and Sanitation: Manual sanitation of equipment in the restaurant is a major challenge due to extended operating hours, the increasing pieces and complexity of equipment in kitchens and competing demands from revenue producing tasks. Innovative technologies in foodservice equipment can improve sanitation or make such processes more efficient thereby allowing for increased productivity and lower operating costs.


• | Energy Efficiency: Increasing the efficiency of individual components and reducing standby energy losses is another key driver of innovation. An example of reducing standby energy loss is the use of induction heating for holding pans so that energy is only used when a thermal load is present. We are also a leader in the area of high efficiency combustion systems with metal matrix burner technology. This technology reduces gas consumption and allows for variable firing rate. For cooking, natural refrigerants such as propane-based R-290 offer improved thermodynamic performance, and variable speed compressors and fans further increase overall cycle performance under partial load conditions.


• | Mobile Connectivity and Monitoring: Integration of mobile devices and digital connectivity in kitchens is increasing rapidly and will extend the user interface beyond the traditional boundaries of the equipment. Our KitchenConnect enabled products also include a system for equipment monitoring which collects data to reduce downtime, optimize energy use and improve service response time.

Certain new products and upgrades we introduced in 2018 include:
Hot-Side Products

• | Frymaster FQ 4000 (QSR chains) - This platform combines our patented oil quality sensing system, which maximizes oil life without risk of poor food quality, with our exclusive EasyTouch touch screen controls for ease of use and connectivity to our KitchenConnect applications.


• | Merrychef eikon e1s - This high speed accelerated cooking oven provides a more economical, entry level oven that still features combined microwave and high velocity impingement cooking for restaurants requiring less production.


• | Crem Coffee Machines - A total of seven new and updated models of coffee machines, ranging from fully automatic "bean to cup" platforms to single-serving, manual espresso machines.

Cold-Side Products

• | Kolpak Structural Ceilings and Floors - Integrated structural reinforcements allow longer ceiling spans and greater floor loading without expensive addition of separate structural supports or floor reinforcements.


• | Manitowoc Energy Efficiency Upgrades - We upgraded our Manitowoc branded undercounter cubers, flake, nugget, countertop nugget, and Koolaire branded modular and undercounter cubers to exceed new U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") minimum energy efficiency requirements for these types of products.


• | Multiplex Craft Beverage Dispenser - This is a dispensing tower with the aesthetics of a high-end bar tap and the convenience of a post-mix, carbonated soft drink system incorporated inside.

Engineering, Research and Development
We have a staff of in-house engineers and technicians, supplemented with external engineering resources, who collectively are responsible for improving existing products and developing new products. We incurred total engineering costs of $46.7 million, $46.1 million and $48.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which included research and development costs of $37.3 million, $39.4 million and $35.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

We hold numerous patents pertaining to our products and have presently pending applications for additional patents in the U.S. and foreign countries. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks and licenses that are of material importance to our business and we believe our ownership of this intellectual property is adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
-13-

Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio provides: global protection of our research and development efforts and product development investments; recognizable competitive distinctions and proprietary advantages; brand support and enhancement; and leverage for value creation opportunities such as licenses. We take efforts to protect, enforce and defend our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate.
Regulatory Environment
In the Americas, EMEA and APAC, we actively work with standards organizations, industry associations, certification parties, and regulatory bodies to develop and promote effective and balanced standards, codes, and regulations that provide for the advancement of sustainable customer solutions, with the highest possible levels of energy efficiency, sanitation, environmental standards, safety, and food quality. For example, we are active members of the North American Association of Food Equipment Manufacturers, the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, the Underwriters Laboratories task group, the National Sanitation Foundation's International Joint Committee, the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, various working groups responsible for European safety standards in Europe, the Industrial Association for House, Heating and Kitchen Technology, and other regional standards organizations. We fully engage with the DOE on new energy standards, the U.S. EPA on ENERGY STAR programs and the Significant New Alternatives Policy program related to alternative refrigerant regulations, as well as the European Union's Ecodesign directive consultant organizations.
Backlog
We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio and the relatively short period between order and shipment date on most products.
Seasonality
Typically, the first quarter of our fiscal year represents the least favorable period for our financial results while the third quarter of our fiscal year typically is the most favorable. Our customers are primarily in the northern hemisphere, and the warmer summer weather generally leads to an increase in construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 5,500 people worldwide and had seven employee unions in North America, one trade union in Europe and three trade unions in China. Many of our European employees belong to the trade union or a European works council. 
Raw Materials
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners where appropriate. The primary raw materials that we use are rolled steel, aluminum, and copper, which are generally available in adequate quantities from numerous suppliers. We generally aim to maintain alternative sources of supplies and materials when possible, but some parts and key components we use in the manufacturing of our products are obtained from sole sources of supply. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and consider our current sources of supply to be adequate for our present and anticipated future requirements.
