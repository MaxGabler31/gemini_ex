DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We design, manufacture and sell innovative products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial and aftermarket customers, and generated revenues of $11.8 billion in 2018. We serve both original equipment (OE) manufacturers and replacement markets worldwide. Our portfolio of the industry’s most well-respected enduring brands include Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, among others. We seek to leverage our OE product engineering and development capability, manufacturing know-how, and expertise in managing a broad and deep range of replacement parts to service the aftermarket. We effectively manage the life cycle of a broad range of products to a diverse customer base. 
As a parts supplier, we produce individual component parts for vehicles as well as groups of components that are combined as modules or systems within vehicles. These parts, modules, and systems are sold globally to the world's leading light vehicle and commercial truck manufacturers as well as aftermarket customers, including independent warehouse distributors, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, mass merchants, and service chains.
On October 1, 2018, we closed the acquisition of Federal-Mogul, (the "Acquisition") pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2018, by and among us, Federal-Mogul, American Entertainment Properties Corp. (“AEP”) and Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“IEP”). We agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company’s aftermarket and ride performance business and its powertrain technology business into two new independent, publicly traded companies in a spin-off transaction that is expected to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We expect the spin-off to be completed in the second half of 2019.
As a result of the Acquisition, the number of our reportable segments increased from three to five segments, consisting of the following: our historical Clean Air, Ride Performance and Aftermarket segments and the newly acquired Powertrain and Motorparts segments. 
Our Industry 
The parts industry for vehicles and engines is generally separated into two categories, both of which we operate within:(1) “original equipment” or “OE” parts that are sold in large quantities directly for use by manufacturers of light vehicles and commercial vehicles and (2) “aftermarket” or replacement parts that are sold in varying quantities to wholesalers, retailers and installers. Light vehicles are comprised of passenger cars and light trucks, which include sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), crossover vehicles (CUVs), pick-up trucks, vans and multi-purpose passenger vehicles. Commercial vehicles include commercial trucks and off-highway equipment. 
Global OE Industry
Products for the global OE industry are sold directly to OE manufacturers that use these parts, which include components, systems, subsystems, and modules, in the manufacture of new light and commercial vehicles. Demand for component parts in the OE market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles/engines produced, which is driven by macroeconomic conditions and other factors such as fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment trends, regulatory requirements, and trade agreements. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow revenues by increasing their product content per vehicle. Companies, like us, with a global presence, leading technology and innovation, and advanced product, engineering, manufacturing, and customer support capabilities are best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
Key Industry Trends Affecting the Global OE Industry
Global Light Vehicle Production
Global light vehicle production is expected to grow by approximately 2% annually from 2018 to 2025, reaching nearly 109 million units by 2025, according to leading forecasting company IHS Markit. In 2018, global light vehicle production declined 1% versus the previous year, including a 1% decline in North America, 1% decline in Europe and 4% decline in China, with increases of 3% in South America and 6% in India. Global light vehicle production increased 2% in 2017 and 5% in 2016.

Intelligent Suspension, Autonomous Driving and Mobility
There are a number of trends that are driving “Auto 2.0,” defined as the transformation of cars into hybrid systems, electric and fully autonomous vehicles, the business model shift from individual car ownership to ride-sharing, and multi-model forms of mobility. For instance, higher levels of autonomy will drive increased passenger expectations for a comfortable ride, which, in turn, will create additional content opportunities per vehicle and heighten demand for advanced suspension products, including full-corner/around-the-wheel intelligent suspension systems. 
Advanced suspension technology is expected to grow with adoption led by global OE manufacturers. Increased connectivity also presents additional prospects for active suspension systems, predictive vehicle diagnostics, and system-based integration within the vehicle as well as broader vehicle to everything (“V2X”) communications. The addition of Öhlins to the portfolio is expected to accelerate the development of advanced OE intelligent suspension solutions, while also fast-tracking time to market. This acquisition is yet another example of our strategy to leverage key technologies that will better position us to take advantage of secular trends. It will also enhance our portfolio in broader mobility markets through the addition of Öhlins’ range of premium OE and aftermarket automotive and motorsports performance products.
Maturing powertrain technology, including the increased adoption of hybrid and fully electric powertrains, will create further opportunities for increased ride performance and noise, vibration and harshness (“NVH”) capabilities, as consumers look for smoother, quieter and more efficient rides. Our capability in both the suspension and NVH performance materials categories provide the opportunity to maximize driving comfort and ride performance for motorists worldwide.
Shared mobility describes a range of transportation options that involve the shared use of a vehicle, motorcycle, scooter, bicycle or other travel mode; it provides users with short-term access to a transportation mode on an as-needed basis. Shared mobility may reduce vehicle volumes in established markets, but it also provides an opportunity for us to develop higher-mileage, durable solutions to meet the needs of new mobility fleets. Additionally, ride comfort and durability will become increasingly important differentiators as consumers increasingly take advantage of the sharing economy.
Focus on Fuel Economy, Reduced Emissions and Alternative Energy Sources
Increased fuel economy and decreased vehicle emissions are of great importance to OE suppliers, as customers, consumers and legislators continue to demand more efficient and cleaner operating vehicles. Increasingly stringent fuel economy standards and environmental regulations are driving OE customers to focus on new technologies including downsized, higher-output and turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines, and hybrid electric and pure electric powertrains, such as fuel cell and battery powered cars. We continue to expand our investment around the world, in regions such as North America, Europe, China, India, and Japan to capitalize on the growing demand for environmentally friendly solutions for light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway applications driven by environmental regulations in these regions.
The products that our clean air segment provides reduce the tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. In addition, regulations have been adopted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide. Reducing CO2 emissions requires improving fuel economy; as a result improved combustion efficiency and reduction of vehicle mass have become priorities. As a leading supplier of clean air systems with strong technical capabilities, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the more rigorous environmental standards being adopted around the world. 
The demand for smaller but more powerful engines requires more technology per engine to withstand the higher output requirements, which we estimate will result in an increase in content per engine for our powertrain business. With a global manufacturing presence, we believe we are well-positioned to meet expectations of our global customers. For the foreseeable future, it is expected that gasoline and diesel engines will remain the dominant powertrain for cars (including hybrids), heavy-duty, and industrial applications. We are equally capable of providing components for both gasoline and diesel engines.
Increasing Technologically Sophisticated Content
As end users and consumers continue to demand vehicles with improved performance, safety and functionality at competitive prices, the components and systems in these vehicles are becoming technologically more advanced and sophisticated. Mechanical functions are being replaced with electronics; and mechanical and electronic devices are being integrated into single systems. More stringent emission and other regulatory standards are increasing the complexity of the systems as well.
To remain competitive as a parts and systems supplier, we invest in engineering, research and development. We also fund and sponsor university and other independent research to advance development efforts. By investing in technology, we have been able to expand our product offerings and penetrate new markets.

Enhanced Vehicle Safety and Handling
To serve the needs of their customers and meet government mandates, OE manufacturers are seeking parts suppliers that invest in new technologies, capabilities and products that advance vehicle safety and handling, such as roll-over protection systems, intelligent suspension, and safer, more durable materials. Those suppliers, such as us, that are able to offer such innovative products and technologies have a distinct competitive advantage. We offer adjustable and adaptive damping as well as semi-active suspension systems designed to improve vehicle stability, handling and control. 
We also are a global leader in the development of leading friction formulas that improve vehicle stopping distances and performance. As the commercial truck customers migrate to air disc brake systems, we remain at the forefront of providing the brake friction necessary for these new systems.
Many of our aftermarket products directly affect vehicle performance. Product quality, reliability, and consistency are paramount to our end-customers, the majority of whom are professional service technicians. Our engineering prowess and product capabilities from chassis to braking allow us to provide a complete around-the-wheel offering. Additionally, we have a number of braking products including disc pads for passenger cars, motorcycles and commercial vehicles; drum brake shoes and CV drum brake lining; and brake accessories including rotors, drums, hydraulics, hardware and brake fluid. 
Sourcing by OE Manufacturers
As OE manufacturers expand their reach, many are looking for suppliers with a global footprint and the capability to supply them with full system integration and solutions, rather than individual standalone products.
Because of these trends, OE manufacturers are increasingly seeking suppliers capable of supporting vehicle platforms on a global basis. They want suppliers like us with design, production, engineering and logistics capabilities that can be accessed not just in North America and Europe but also in emerging markets such as India and China. OE manufacturers have standardized on global platforms, designing basic mechanical structures suitable for a number of similar vehicle models and are able to accommodate different features across regions. This standardization will drive growth in production of light vehicles designed on global platforms. Accordingly, global platforms, identified as platforms produced in more than one region, are expected to grow.
As OE manufacturers look to simplify and streamline design, they are also increasingly selecting suppliers like us that provide fully-engineered, integrated systems and solutions. OE manufacturers have steadily outsourced more of the design and manufacturing of vehicle parts and systems to simplify the assembly process, lower costs and reduce development times. Furthermore, they have demanded from their parts suppliers fully integrated, functional modules and systems made possible with the development of advanced electronics in addition to innovative, individual vehicle components and parts that may not readily interface together. 
Global Aftermarket Industry 
Products for the global aftermarket are sold directly to a wide range of distributors, retail parts stores, and mass merchants that distribute these products to professional service providers, “do-it-yourself” consumers, and in some cases, directly to service chains. Demand for aftermarket products historically has been driven by four primary factors: (i) the number of vehicles in operation (“VIO”); (ii) the average age of VIO; (iii) vehicle usage trends; and (iv) component failure and wear rates. These factors, while applicable in all regions, vary depending on the composition of VIO and other factors.
Key trends affecting the Global Aftermarket Industry
Growth in the Number of VIO in both Mature and Emerging Markets 
The global number of VIO is expected to grow, with the number of VIO in emerging markets such as China expected to increase substantially. The number of VIO in mature markets, such as North America and Europe, is also expected to grow, though at a lesser pace than the emerging markets. We have strong aftermarket positions in North America, Europe and South America and a growing aftermarket position in Asia. We expect there to be aftermarket growth opportunities in emerging markets such as China and India where the VIO are expected to increase and are investing to position ourselves as a leading aftermarket supplier in these regions. We are leveraging our market-leading capabilities from mature markets and investing to develop the right distributor base, drive brand recognition, increase product coverage, build the supply chain and promote our experience as an OE-quality supplier.
Increase in the Average Age of Vehicles in Operation
The average age of VIO in North America and Europe has increased significantly this century, and is expected to increase further. Increases in the average age of VIO will drive the need for maintenance and repair work, thereby increasing the overall demand for aftermarket replacement parts in North America and Europe. The average age of VIO in China is expected to increase, which we believe will lead to continuing significant growth in the China aftermarket.

Extended Product Life of Automotive Parts
The average useful life of automotive parts, both OE and replacement, has steadily increased in recent years due to technological innovations including longer-lasting materials. As a result, there are more vehicles on the road than ever before. Aftermarket suppliers are focused on reducing costs and providing product differentiation through advanced technology and recognized brand names. With our long history of technological innovation, iconic brands and operational efficiency, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage our products and technology.
Managing Complexity 
We operate in a highly fragmented and dynamic industry and are among the few large aftermarket-focused suppliers globally. The increasing global vehicle population, brand and vehicle complexity, and need for rapid new part introduction, as well as new distribution channels (including online) continue to drive significant SKU proliferation and business complexity. Our recent investments in our supply chain and information technology capabilities are designed to manage this complexity, which we believe will be an important competitive differentiator.
Channel Consolidation
In the more mature markets of North America and Europe, there has been increasing consolidation in the aftermarket distribution channel with larger aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. These distributors generally require larger, more capable suppliers that have the ability to provide world-class product expertise, category management capabilities, brand management and supply chain support, as well as a competitive manufacturing and sourcing network. We have undertaken many initiatives to support the value of our branded products to end-market consumers and diversify our revenue base. 
Growth of Online Capabilities
Reaching consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is expected to have an increasing effect on the global aftermarket industry and how aftermarket products are marketed and sold. The establishment of a robust online presence will be critical for suppliers regardless of whether they intend to participate directly in e-commerce. We invested heavily in online initiatives to improve our capabilities and connectivity to our end-customers, including a new online order management system, customer relationship management tools, global brand websites, and data analytics capabilities. We will continue to invest in these competencies. Additionally, consumers increasingly are utilizing online research prior to making buying or repair decisions. We will continue to expand our online presence in order to connect with our customers and more effectively communicate the value of our premium aftermarket brands.
Increase in Lower Cost, Private Label Brands
In many of our markets, there has been an increase in private label or store brands sold by retailers and distributors at a lower price point than premium brands of the same products. However, in many cases, retailers or wholesale distributors creating private label brands still rely on established suppliers, like us, to design and manufacture their private label products and, in some cases, utilize co-branding to support their private label offerings. 
We have some of the strongest and most recognized brands in the automotive aftermarket. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in product innovation, marketing and brand support that differentiate our premium branded products for their quality while also supporting lower priced, mid- grade offerings. Additionally, we expect to continue to drive productivity and cost reduction efforts and enhance our already strong global sourcing capabilities to remain competitive in each product tier.
Resilience during Economic Downturn
Aftermarket products are largely stable, non-discretionary and less susceptible to cyclicality as customers often have no choice but to replace automotive parts that are worn. During the 2008 economic downturn, the number of consumers with the ability to purchase new vehicles declined and led to increased demand for aftermarket parts in order to keep older vehicles road-worthy. The resilience of the automotive aftermarket industry is exhibited by the fact that the U.S. light vehicle aftermarket has grown every year for the last 20 years, except for 2009 when industry sales declined by approximately 1.4% according to Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association (AASA). 
Customers
We strive to develop long-standing business relationships with our customers around the world. We work collaboratively with our OE customers in all stages of production, including design, development, component sourcing, quality assurance, manufacturing and delivery. For both OE and aftermarket customers, we provide timely delivery of quality products at competitive prices and deliver customer service. With our diverse product mix and numerous facilities in major markets worldwide, we believe we are well positioned to meet customer needs. 
10

Our OE customers consist of automotive and commercial manufacturers as well as agricultural, off-highway, marine, railroad, aerospace, high performance, and power generation and industrial application manufacturers. We have well-established relationships with substantially all major American, European, and Asian automotive OE manufacturers.
The following customers accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three years.

Customer | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
General Motors Company | 12 | % | | 14 | % | 17 | %
Ford Motor Company | 12 | % | | 13 | % | 13 | %

Our aftermarket customers include independent warehouse distributors that redistribute products to local parts suppliers, distributors, engine rebuilders, retail parts stores, mass merchants and service chains. The breadth of our product lines, the strength of our leading marketing expertise, a sizable sales force, and supply chain and logistics capabilities are central to our success in the aftermarket. We have a large and diverse aftermarket customer base. 
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets. Customer loyalty is a key element of competition in these markets and is developed through long-standing relationships, customer service, high quality value-added products and timely delivery. Product pricing and services provided are other important competitive factors.
As a supplier of OE and aftermarket parts, we compete with the vehicle manufacturers, some of which are also customers of ours, and numerous independent suppliers. We believe we are meeting these competitive challenges by developing leading technologies, efficiently integrating and expanding our manufacturing and distribution operations, widening our product coverage within our core businesses, restructuring our operations and transferring production to best cost countries, and utilizing our worldwide technical centers to develop and provide value-added solutions to our customers.
Seasonality
Our businesses are somewhat seasonal. OE production is historically higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. It typically decreases in the third quarter due to OE plant shutdowns for model changeovers and European holidays, and softens further in the fourth quarter due to reduced production during the end-of-year holiday season in North America and Europe. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. Our aftermarket operations experience relatively higher demand during the spring as vehicle owners prepare for the summer driving season. While seasonality does impact our business, actual results may vary from the above trends due to global and local economic dynamics as well as industry-specific platform launches and other production-related events. Aftermarket sales tend not to be as adversely affected during periods of economic downturn, as consumers forgo new vehicle purchases and keep their vehicles longer, thereby increasing demand for repair and maintenance services. 
The aftermarket is affected by changes in economic conditions, volatility in fuel prices, and expanding focus on environmental and energy conservation. 
Order Fulfillment
For OE customers, we generally receive long-term production contracts for specific products supplied for particular vehicles. These supply relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle, subject to interim design and technical specification revisions, and do not require the customer to purchase a minimum quantity. In addition to customary commercial terms and conditions, long-term production contracts generally provide for annual price reductions based upon expected productivity improvements and other factors. Customers typically retain the right to terminate long-term production contracts, but we generally cannot terminate long-term production contracts. OE order fulfillment is typically manufactured in response to customer purchase order releases, and we ship directly from a manufacturing location to the customer for use in vehicle production and assembly. Accordingly, our manufacturing locations turn finished goods inventory relatively quickly, producing from on-hand raw materials and work-in-process inventory within relatively short manufacturing cycles. Significant risks to us include a change in vehicle or engine production, lower than expected vehicle or engine production by one or more of our OE customers, or termination of the business based upon perceived or actual shortfalls in delivery, quality or value.
For our global aftermarket customers, we generally establish product line arrangements that encompass substantially all parts offered within a particular product line. In some cases, we will enter into agreements with terms ranging from one to three years that cover one or more product lines with fixed prices. Pricing is market responsive and subject to adjustment based upon competitive pressures, material costs, and other commercial factors. Global aftermarket order fulfillment is largely performed from finished goods inventory stocked in our worldwide distribution network. Inventory stocking levels in our distribution centers are established based upon historical and anticipated future customer demand.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation we will supply certain levels of OE production over such periods, we believe outstanding purchase orders and product line arrangements do not constitute firm 
11

orders. Firm orders are limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials and work-in-process inventory for OE orders, and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. 
Clean Air Segment
We operate 64 clean air manufacturing facilities worldwide, of which 17 facilities are located in North and South America, 20 in Europe and 27 in Asia Pacific. We operate 16 of the manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific through joint ventures in which we hold a controlling interest. We operate five clean air engineering and technical facilities worldwide and share three other such facilities with our ride performance operations. Of the five clean air engineering and technical facilities, one is located in North America, two in Europe, and two in Asia Pacific. In addition, one joint venture in which we hold a noncontrolling interest operates one manufacturing facility in Europe.
Through the recent acquisition of Federal-Mogul Powertrain, combined with our Clean Air emissions expertise, we are focused on delivering an optimized trade-off between fuel economy and emission control from the cylinder to the tailpipe. Specifically, Clean Air products and systems are designed to help global OE manufacturers in light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway markets to meet global emissions regulations anywhere in the world. With significant investment in core sciences and technical capabilities, including combustion and thermal management, materials science and thermoelectrical energy, we are able to provide advance emissions solutions that solve unique technical challenges.
Our technologies are broken into four key product areas:

• | Emissions Control Products — includes Dosing Systems, Advanced Mixers, Selective Catalytic Reduction, Gasoline and Diesel Particulate Filters and Catalytic Converters;


• | Lightweighting and Thermal Management — includes Rankine Cycle Power Pack, Thermo-electric Generators, Thermoacoustic Converters, Heat Exchangers, Lightweight Aftertreatment Systems and Fabricated Manifolds;


• | Acoustic Products — includes Muffler and Resonator Tuning Devices. Active Noise Cancellation, Signature Sound, Smart Sound and Electronic and Passive Valves; and


• | Noise, Vibration and Harshness — includes Exhaust System Isolators, Lightweight Hanger Solutions and Modular Exhaust Dampers.

Our engineering capabilities include advanced predictive design tools, advanced prototyping processes and state-of-the-art testing equipment. These technological capabilities make us a “full system” integrator and supplier to the OE manufacturers, supplying optimized emission control systems from the manifold to the tailpipe, while delivering emission regulatory compliance and acoustic noise control. Our technology includes the use of urea injectors, electronic controls and software for use in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and other exhaust after-treatment systems. We also offer a complete suite of alternative full system NOx aftertreatment technologies, including the Hydrocarbon Lean NOx Catalyst (HC-LNC) technology.
Vehicle emission control products and systems play a critical role in safely conveying noxious exhaust gases away from the passenger compartment and reducing the level of pollutants and engine exhaust noise emitted to acceptable levels. Precise engineering of the exhaust system - which extends from the manifold that connects an engine’s exhaust ports to an exhaust pipe, to the catalytic converter that eliminates pollutants from the exhaust, and to the muffler that modulates noise emissions - leads to a pleasantly tuned engine sound, reduced pollutants and optimized engine performance.

Within each of our ride performance manufacturing facilities, operations are organized by product (e.g., shocks, struts and vibration control products) and include computer numerically controlled and conventional machine centers; tube milling and drawn-over-mandrel manufacturing equipment; metal inert gas and resistance welding; powdered metal pressing and sintering; chrome plating; stamping; and assembly/test capabilities. Our manufacturing systems incorporate cell-based designs, allowing work-in-process to move through the operation with greater speed and flexibility.
In designing our shock absorbers and struts, we use advanced engineering and test capabilities to provide product reliability, endurance and performance. Our engineering capabilities feature advanced computer-aided design equipment and testing facilities. Our dedication to innovative solutions has led to such technological advances as:

• | Adaptive damping systems — adapt to the vehicle’s motion to better control undesirable vehicle motions;


• | Electronically adjustable suspensions — change suspension performance based on a variety of inputs such as steering, braking, vehicle height, and velocity; and


• | Air leveling systems — manually or automatically adjust the height of the vehicle.

Superior ride control is governed by a vehicle’s suspension system, including shock absorbers and struts. Shock absorbers and struts maintain the vertical loads placed on vehicle tires, helping keep the tires in contact with the road. Vehicle steering, braking, acceleration and safety depend on maintaining contact between the tires and the road. Worn shocks and struts can allow excessive transfer of the vehicle’s weight - from side to side, known as “roll;” from front to rear, called “pitch;” or up and down, “bounce.” Because shock absorbers and struts are designed to control the vertical loads placed on tires, they provide resistance to excessive roll, pitch and bounce.

We design and launch clean air products for commercial vehicle customers such as Caterpillar, for whom we are their global diesel clean air system integrator, John Deere, Navistar, Deutz, Daimler Trucks, Scania, Weichai Power, FAW Group and Kubota. We also engineer and build modular NOx-reduction systems for large engines that meet standards of the International Maritime Organization, among others.
Our revenues generated by commercial truck, off-highway and industrial customers were 16% of our total revenues in 2018 and 12% in 2017. 
Aftermarket Specific Strategies
We expect the demand for replacement parts to increase steadily as a result of the anticipated significant increase in VIO through 2040, the increase in the average age of VIO and the increase in the average miles driven per year. The characteristics of aftermarket sales and distribution are defined regionally, which require regionally focused strategies to address the key success factors of our customers. 
The key components of our aftermarket strategy are described below:
Leverage the strength of our global aftermarket leading brands positions, product portfolio and range, marketing and selling expertise, and distribution and logistics capabilities
Our aftermarket business houses multiple leading brands with strong product offerings. We will build upon our brand strengths and grow our global aftermarket business by leveraging our broad product coverage and extensive distribution network. We intend to capitalize on aftermarket trends and expand in established markets (North America, Europe, Australia) as well as high-growth regions (China, South America, India, Southeast and Northeast Asia). Important focus areas are enhancing our presence in high-growth markets; leveraging our portfolio and strong presence in suspension to expand our business globally; and diversifying outside of chassis with our sealing, electronic and underhood products, as well as other components. 
18

Continue to strengthen our aftermarket capabilities and product offerings in mature markets, including North America and Europe
The scale of our aftermarket business allows for strong distribution channels that significantly enhance our go-to-market capabilities across mature markets in North America and Europe. We continually rationalize our already strong distribution networks with the goal of improved customer service at a lower cost. This is achieved by constantly sharing information across channels on best practices in go-to-market, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.
The North America and Europe go-to-market capabilities will be defined by positioning our distribution and installer partners for success. We believe this will require maintaining a vast catalog of products to provide the ability to address customer requirements quickly and easily. Managing vast and complex catalog of products requires an understanding of the composition of the car parc within the regions including wear patterns, typical replacement rates based on weather, road quality, and average miles driven annually. These compositions differ significantly by region, which will impact the range and frequency of replacement part requirements. The understanding of these regional dynamics will help us provide the right parts when they are needed and achieve the industry’s best “Order to Delivery” times. We will continue to innovate product solutions that will be cost competitive, reliable, reduce install time, reduce the number of unique parts that installers need to inventory on-site, reduce the number of unique installer tools and equipment required, and improve installer safety. 
In addition to having a comprehensive product catalog, we also strive to maintain very close relationships with our customers and help position them for success. We have launched a series of ‘Tech First’ initiatives to provide online, on demand, and onsite technical training and support to vehicle repair technicians who use and install our products in North America, Europe and China and plan to expand into South America. This initiative included Garage Gurus™, a network of technical support centers that provide some of the most comprehensive training programs in the industry that educate our partners and customers with emerging vehicle technologies and vehicle repair operational skills. We believe it is key to our strategy to provide aftermarket parts that are simple to install and to make sure our customers have the resources to know how to install these parts properly. In having the right products and resources for our customers, we believe we will continue to be a preferred aftermarket supplier and continue to drive growth in the Americas and emerging economic areas.

Increase aftermarket position in high-growth regions, notably in Asia Pacific
The Asia Pacific region, particularly the high-growth markets of China and India, presents a significant opportunity for us to expand our business. We have made investments in distribution and in our sales force in both China and the rest of Asia to help drive growth in this increasingly important region. We must take into account the different operational requirements in Asia Pacific in order to drive aftermarket growth in this region. 
The Asia Pacific light vehicle and commercial vehicle aftermarket industry is fragmented with a large number of small distributors and installers that require different strategies and solutions than more mature consolidated markets. Distribution in smaller volumes will require us to have a hub and spoke warehousing approach to compete on the basis of optimal “Order to Delivery” timeliness while maintaining a broad range of products.
Additionally, buying online is the preferred purchase method for many smaller distribution and installer partners. The sophistication of the existing online marketplaces in Asia Pacific will require us to develop adaptive and flexible omnichannel tools in order to compete effectively. We believe that developing a competitive online platform for our Asia Pacific customers will be the foundation for us to build a digital platform that will improve our competitiveness globally.
Environmental Matters
For additional information regarding environmental matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental Matters” and Note 15—Commitments and Contingencies of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 81,000 employees of whom approximately 48% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of two facilities in the U.S., most of our unionized manufacturing facilities have their own contracts with their own expiration dates and, as a result, no contract expiration date affects more than one facility. 
Other
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in our manufacturing processes, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals, non-metallic raw materials, stampings, castings and forgings. We also purchase parts manufactured by other manufacturers for sale in the aftermarket. The principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. We believe that an adequate supply of steel can presently be obtained from a number of different domestic and foreign suppliers. We address price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component sourcing and parts assembly in best 
19

cost countries, strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities, and aggressively negotiating with our customers to allow us to recover these higher costs from them.
We hold a number of domestic and foreign patents and trademarks relating to our products and businesses. Through our acquisition of Federal-Mogul, we acquired in excess of 6,900 patents and more than 6,700 active trademark registrations and applications worldwide. We manufacture and distribute our aftermarket products under a number of brand names that are well-recognized in the marketplace and some of are registered trademarks. We also market certain of our clean air products to OE manufacturers under the names Solid SCR™ and XNOx®. The patents, trademarks and other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us are important in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products. However, we do not materially rely on any single patent, nor will the expiration of any single patent materially affect our business. Our current patents expire over various periods into the year 2040. We are actively introducing and patenting new technology to replace formerly patented technology before the expiration of the existing patents. In the aggregate, our worldwide patent portfolio is materially important to our business because it enables us to achieve technological differentiation from our competitors.
