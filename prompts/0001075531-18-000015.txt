Item 1.  Business

Our mission is to help people experience the world. We operate six primary brands: 

• | Booking.com - the world’s leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked.


• | priceline.com - a leading hotel, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation service in the United States.


• | KAYAK - a leading meta-search service allowing consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of travel websites at once.


• | agoda.com - a leading accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region.


• | Rentalcars.com - a leading worldwide rental car reservation service.


• | OpenTable - a leading provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management and customer acquisition services to restaurants.

Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of Booking.com, agoda.com and Rentalcars.com (which began operating as part of Booking.com on January 1, 2018) and the international businesses of KAYAK and OpenTable. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the consumer is physically located while using our services or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made through Booking.com at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the United States is part of our international results. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our international business (the substantial majority of which is generated by Booking.com) represented approximately 89% of our consolidated gross profit. A significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservations. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more geographic information.
Booking Holdings Inc. was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1997 and was converted into a Delaware corporation named priceline.com Incorporated in July 1998.  On April 1, 2014, the Company changed its name from priceline.com Incorporated to The Priceline Group Inc., and, on February 21, 2018, the Company changed its name to Booking Holdings Inc. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "BKNG," and traded under the symbol "PCLN" prior to February 27, 2018.  Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut 06854. We refer to our company and all of our subsidiaries and brands collectively as "Booking Holdings," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us." 
The Booking Holdings Business Model

We derive substantially all of our revenues and gross profit from the following sources:

• | Commissions earned from facilitating reservations of accommodations, rental cars and other travel services on an agency basis;

 1


• | Transaction gross profit on a merchant basis and customer processing fees from our accommodation, rental car, airline ticket and vacation package reservation services;


• | Advertising revenues primarily earned by KAYAK from sending referrals to online travel companies ("OTCs") and travel service providers, as well as from advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps;


• | Reservation revenues paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation services, subscription fees for restaurant reservation management services provided by OpenTable; and


• | Damage excess waiver fees, travel insurance fees and global distribution system ("GDS") reservation booking fees, in each case related to certain of our travel services.

Our priceline.com brand offers merchant Name Your Own Price® opaque travel services, which are recorded in revenue on a "gross" basis and have associated cost of revenue. All of our other services are generally recorded in revenue on a "net" basis and have no significant associated cost of revenue. Therefore, revenue increases and decreases are impacted by changes in the mix of our revenues between Name Your Own Price® travel services and other services. Gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our services. Consequently, gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because, in contrast to our revenues, it is not affected by the different methods of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our Name Your Own Price® travel reservation services and our other services. On January 1, 2018, we adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard which will change the presentation of our Name Your Own Price® revenue to a net basis (see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, and, as a result, we will no longer report cost of revenues or gross profit.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had gross profit of approximately $12.4 billion comprised of "agency" gross profit, "merchant" gross profit, and "advertising and other" gross profit.  Agency gross profit is derived from travel-related transactions where we do not facilitate payments for the travel services provided. Agency gross profit, which represented the majority of our total gross profit in 2017, consists primarily of: (1) travel reservation commissions; (2) certain GDS reservation booking fees and (3) certain travel insurance fees. Merchant gross profit is derived from services where we facilitate payments for the travel services provided, and consists of: (1) transaction gross profit representing the amount charged to a consumer, less the amount charged to us by travel service providers, and merchant travel reservation commissions; (2) transaction revenues representing the price of Name Your Own Price® reservations charged to a customer (with a corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenues); (3) ancillary fees, including damage excess waiver and certain travel insurance fees and certain GDS reservation booking fees and (4) customer processing fees. Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from (1) revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on KAYAK's websites and mobile apps; (2) revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) reservation fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation services and (b) subscription fees earned by OpenTable for restaurant reservation management services; (3) revenues earned by priceline.com for advertising on its websites; and (4) revenues generated by Booking.com's BookingSuite branded accommodation marketing and business analytics services. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
The Booking Holdings Strategy

We aim to achieve our mission to help people experience the world through global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by:

• | providing consumers with the best choices and prices at any time, in any place, on any device;


• | making it easy for people to find, book and experience their travel desires; and


• | providing platforms, tools and insights to our business partners to help them be successful.

We focus on relentless innovation and execution and a commitment to serve both consumers and our travel service provider and restaurant partners with unmatched service and best-in-class digital technology. The online travel and dining categories continue to grow as consumer purchasing shifts from traditional offline channels to interactive online channels, including mobile channels. Our strategy is to continue to participate broadly in this online growth by expanding our service offerings and markets. In particular, we aim to be the world leader in online travel and restaurant reservation and related services by (a) leveraging technology to provide consumers with the best experience, (b) partnering with travel service providers and restaurants to our mutual benefit, (c) operating entrepreneurial brands that collaborate and share best practices, and (d) investing in profitable and sustainable growth.

• | Providing the best consumer experience. We believe that offering consumers an outstanding online experience is essential for our future success. To accomplish this, we focus on providing consumers with: (a) a variety of intuitive, easy-to-use online travel and restaurant reservation and search services; (b) a continually increasing number, location and variety of accommodations and restaurants available through our services; (c) informative 

 2

and useful content, such as pictures, accommodation and restaurant details and reviews; and (d) excellent customer service. Our goal is to make travel easy, frictionless and personal and to offer consumers the most trusted brand, the most personalized experience and the most extensive, varied and comprehensive accommodation selection in every geography at the best prices. For example, Booking.com increasingly provides reservation services for accommodations other than hotels. Booking.com included approximately 1,586,000 properties on its website as of December 31, 2017, consisting of approximately 396,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,190,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Further, we endeavor to provide excellent customer service in a variety of ways, including through our call centers and websites, so that consumers can be confident that booking reservations through us will lead to a positive experience. We are constantly innovating in order to provide a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use websites and mobile apps to ensure that we are meeting the needs of online consumers while aiming to exceed their expectations.

• | Partnering with travel service providers and restaurants. We aim to establish mutually beneficial relationships with travel service providers and restaurants around the world. We believe that travel service providers and restaurants benefit from participating in our services by increasing their distribution channels, demand and inventory utilization in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Travel service providers and restaurants benefit from our well-known brands and online marketing efforts, expertise in offering an excellent consumer experience through our websites and mobile apps and ability to offer their inventory in markets and to consumers that the travel service provider or restaurant may be unable or unlikely to reach. For example, an independent hotel may not have the means or expertise to market itself to international travelers, including in other languages, to build and operate effective desktop and mobile websites and online reservation services, or to engage in sophisticated online marketing techniques. Further, we are increasingly providing services, other than reservations booked through our websites and mobile apps, designed to help our partners grow their businesses. For example, Booking.com's BookingSuite services are designed to offer accommodation providers with affordable marketing and business analytics tools to help them attract customers and more effectively manage their properties. Similarly, OpenTable is continuously working to improve its reservation management software services to help restaurants more effectively manage their reservations and more efficiently market their available tables to diners. 


• | Maintaining multiple brands. We employ a strategy of operating multiple brands, which we believe allows us the opportunity to offer our reservation services in ways that appeal to different consumers, pursue different marketing and business strategies, encourage experimentation and innovation, provide different service offerings and focus on different markets, while benefiting all of our brands from opportunities to share best practices and learning and to collaborate. We intend to invest resources to support organic growth by all of our brands, whether through increased advertising, geographic expansion, technology innovation or increased access to accommodations, rental cars, restaurants or other services. For example, we spend significant and increasing amounts on performance and brand advertising to acquire customers and establish and strengthen our brands. We intend to continue efforts to share best practices, access to travel service provider offerings and customers across our brands and to collaborate where appropriate to benefit consumers. For example, on January 1, 2018 we integrated our Rentalcars.com business into Booking.com, which we believe will enable us to more effectively offer Rentalcars.com’s services to address the ground transportation needs of Booking.com’s customers. In addition, Booking.com offers consumers flight search capabilities provided by KAYAK and restaurant reservation services provided by OpenTable. We believe that by promoting our brands worldwide, sharing accommodation reservation availability and customer demand, and applying our industry experiences across brands and markets, we can more effectively expand our reservation services globally and maintain and grow our position as a leading provider of worldwide online travel and restaurant reservation and related services. 


• | Investing in profitable and sustainable growth. We seek to offer online services that meet the needs and the expectations of consumers, travel service providers and restaurants and that we believe will result in long-term profitability and growth. We intend to accomplish this through continuous investment and innovation, growing our businesses in new and current markets, expanding our services and ensuring that we provide an appealing, intuitive and easy-to-use consumer experience through our websites and mobile apps. We have made significant investments in people, technology, advertising and expanded, new or additional services, such as increasing our extensive collection of accommodations including homes, apartments and other unique places to stay, insurance products and other offerings. We also may pursue strategic transactions. For example, in 2017 we expanded our KAYAK meta-search business, in particular in Europe, through the acquisition of the Momondo Group. We regularly evaluate, and may pursue and consummate, other potential strategic acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or investments, whether to expand our businesses into complementary areas, expand our current 

 3

businesses, acquire innovative technology or for other reasons. For example, we have a commercial relationship with, and have made significant financial investments in, Ctrip, a leading OTC operating primarily in China.
Service Offerings
Through our online travel reservation services, we connect consumers wishing to make travel reservations with providers of travel services around the world. We offer consumers a broad array of accommodation reservations (including hotels, motels, resorts, homes, apartments, bed and breakfasts, hostels and other properties) through our Booking.com, priceline.com and agoda.com brands. Our priceline.com brand also offers consumers reservations for rental cars, airline tickets, vacation packages and cruises. We offer rental car reservations worldwide through our Rentalcars.com and Booking.com brands. We also allow consumers to easily compare travel reservation information, such as airline ticket, hotel reservation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of travel websites at once through KAYAK. We provide restaurants with reservation management and customer acquisition services and consumers with the ability to make restaurant reservations at participating restaurants through OpenTable.
Booking.com.  Booking.com is the world's leading brand for booking online accommodation reservations, based on room nights booked, with operations worldwide and headquarters in the Netherlands. As of December 31, 2017, Booking.com offered accommodation reservation services for approximately 1,586,000 properties in over 220 countries and territories on its various websites and in over 40 languages, consisting of approximately 396,000 hotels, motels and resorts and approximately 1,190,000 homes, apartments and other unique places to stay (updated property counts are available on the Booking.com website). Accommodation providers participate in Booking.com, which operates primarily under an agency model, by filing rates and information about the property in Booking.com's proprietary extranet. In addition, Booking.com offers website and other marketing services and business analytics to accommodation providers as part of its BookingSuite initiative.
Booking.com has expanded its offerings to better help consumers experience the world. For example, Booking.com has begun offering tours and activities in certain markets. On January 1, 2018, we began operating our Rentalcars.com business as part of Booking.com to more effectively offer Rentalcar.com’s rental car and other ground transportation services to Booking.com’s customers. Booking.com offers online rental car reservation services on Booking.com and Rentalcars.com, primarily under a merchant model, allowing consumers to make rental car reservations in approximately 53,000 locations throughout the world, with customer support in over 40 languages. Booking.com also offers pre-booked taxi and black car services on Booking.com and Rentalcars.com at over 900 airports throughout the world. In addition, Booking.com offers consumers flight search capabilities provided by KAYAK and restaurant reservation services provided by OpenTable. 
Priceline.com. Priceline.com offers online travel reservation services primarily in the United States and is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. Through priceline.com, we offer consumers hotel, rental car and airline ticket reservation services, as well as vacation packages and cruises. Priceline.com is a leader in the discount travel reservation business, including through its pioneering Name Your Own Price® and Express Deals® "opaque" offerings where certain elements of the service, including the identity of the travel service provider, are not disclosed to the consumer prior to making a reservation. We believe that the combination of priceline.com's retail and opaque models allows it to provide a broad array of options to value-conscious consumers. Priceline.com operates under both a merchant and agency model.
KAYAK. KAYAK, headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, provides an online price comparison service (often referred to as "meta-search") that allows consumers to easily search and compare travel itineraries and prices, including airline ticket, accommodation reservation and rental car reservation information, from hundreds of travel websites at once. KAYAK derives revenues from sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and from advertising placements on its websites and mobile apps. KAYAK offers its services in over 60 countries, with the United States being its largest market, through various websites, including Momondo and Cheapflights (websites we acquired in 2017).
Agoda.com. Agoda.com is a leading online accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumers in the Asia-Pacific region, with headquarters in Singapore and operations in Bangkok, Thailand and throughout the region. Accommodation providers participate in agoda.com, which operates primarily under a merchant model, by filing rates and information about the property in agoda.com's proprietary extranet.

OpenTable. OpenTable is a leading brand for booking online restaurant reservations. Headquartered in San Francisco, California, OpenTable provides online restaurant reservation services to consumers and reservation management services to restaurants. OpenTable does business primarily in the United States, though it continues to invest in expanding its international offerings.

Marketing and Brand Awareness

We have established widely used and recognized e-commerce brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Both our performance advertising expense and brand advertising expense have increased significantly in recent years, a trend we expect to continue. During 2017, our total performance advertising expense was approximately $4.1 billion, primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), meta-search and travel research services and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our websites. We also invested approximately $392 million in brand advertising during 2017. We intend to continue a strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts, including by expanding brand campaigns into additional markets. We expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which is typically in the quarter in which reservations are booked, but have recognized most of our gross profit when the consumer's travel or dining experience is completed. Beginning January 1, 2018, we will recognize revenue for our travel reservation services on a “check-in” basis, such that revenue will be recognized upon check-in at an accommodation, pick-up of a rental car or boarding of a flight. In either case, as a result of this timing difference between when advertising expense is incurred and revenue or gross profit is recognized, advertising expense may not be recognized in the same period as the associated revenue or gross profit.
Competition

We compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are, and are expected to remain, intensely competitive and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Facebook, have access to significantly greater and more diversified resources than we do, and they may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses) to enable them to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight meta-search product (“Google Flights”) and a hotel meta-search business ("Google Hotel Ads") that are growing rapidly, as well as its "Book on Google" reservation functionality and its Google Trips app.

We currently, or may potentially in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including: 

• | online travel reservation services such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire, Orbitz, Travelocity, Wotif, Cheaptickets, ebookers, HotelClub, RatesToGo and CarRentals.com, which are owned by Expedia; Hotel Reservation Service (HRS) and hotel.de, which are owned by Hotel Reservation Service; and AutoEurope, CarTrawler, Ctrip (in which we hold a minority interest), eLong (in which Ctrip holds a significant minority interest), ezTravel (in which Ctrip holds a majority interest), Meituan (in which we hold a small minority interest), MakeMyTrip, OYO Rooms, Yatra, Cleartrip, Traveloka (in which Expedia holds a minority interest), Webjet, Rakuten, Jalan (which is owned by Recruit), ViajaNet, Submarino Viagens, Despegar/Decolar (in which Expedia holds a minority ownership interest), Fliggy (operated by Alibaba), 17u.com, HotelTonight, CheapOair, and eDreams ODIGEO;


• | online accommodation search and/or reservation services, such as Airbnb, HomeAway (which is owned by Expedia) and Tujia (in which Ctrip and Expedia hold investments), currently focused primarily on alternative accommodations, including individually owned properties such as homes and apartments;


• | large online companies, including search, social networking and marketplace companies such as Google, Facebook, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon and Baidu;


• | traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers and tour operators, many of which combine physical locations, telephone services and online services, such as Carlson Wagonlit, American Express, BCD Travel, Concur (which is owned by SAP), Thomas Cook, TUI and Hotelbeds (which recently acquired Tourico and GTA), as well as thousands of individual travel agencies around the world;


• | travel service providers such as accommodation providers, rental car companies and airlines, many of which have their own branded websites to which they drive business, including large hotel chains such as Marriott International, Hilton and Hyatt Hotels, as well as joint efforts by travel service providers such as Room Key, an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel companies;


• | online travel search and price comparison services (generally referred to as "meta-search" services), such as Google Flights, Google Hotel Ads, TripAdvisor, trivago (in which Expedia holds a majority interest), Qunar (which is controlled by Ctrip), Skyscanner (in which Ctrip holds a majority interest) and HotelsCombined;

 5


• | online restaurant reservation services, such as TripAdvisor's LaFourchette, Yelp's SeatMe, Zomato, Bookatable (which is owned by Michelin), Quandoo (which is owned by Recruit) and Resy (in which Airbnb holds a minority interest);


• | companies offering new rental car business models or car- or ride-sharing services that affect demand for rental cars, some of which have developed innovative technologies to improve efficiency of point-to-point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platforms, such as Uber, Lyft, Gett, Zipcar (which is owned by Avis), BlaBlaCar, Didi Chuxing, Grab and Ola; and


• | companies offering technology services and software solutions to accommodation providers, including large global distribution systems, or GDSs, such as Amadeus and Sabre.

Google, the world’s largest search engine and one of the world's largest companies, and other large, established companies with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic have launched search, meta-search and/or reservation booking services and may create additional inroads into online travel. Google's travel meta-search services, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights, are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. Meta-search services leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search results for the consumer's specific itinerary across travel service provider (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies or airlines), OTC and other travel websites and, in many instances, compete directly with us for customers. Meta-search services intend to appeal to consumers by showing broader travel search results than may be available through OTCs or other travel websites, which could lead to travel service providers or others gaining a larger share of search traffic. TripAdvisor and trivago, two other leading meta-search companies, support their meta-search services with significant brand and performance advertising. Through our KAYAK meta-search service, we compete directly with other meta-search services. Further, meta-search services may evolve into more traditional OTCs by offering consumers the ability to make travel reservations directly through their websites. For example, TripAdvisor allows consumers to make a reservation on TripAdvisor at some accommodations through its "Instant Booking" offering, which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chains. 
There has been a proliferation of new channels through which accommodation providers can offer reservations.  For example, companies such as Airbnb and HomeAway (which is owned by Expedia) offer services providing alternative accommodation property owners, particularly individuals, an online place to list their accommodations where travelers can search and book such properties and compete directly with our alternative accommodation services. In addition, Airbnb has begun offering hotel reservations through its online and mobile platforms.
Travel service providers, including hotel chains, rental car companies and airlines with which we conduct business, compete with us in online channels to drive consumers to their own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as us. Travel service providers may charge lower prices and, in some instances, offer advantages such as loyalty points or special discounts to members of closed user groups (such as loyalty program participants or customers with registered accounts), any of which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than our services. Further, consolidation among travel service providers, such as Marriott International's acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, could result in lower rates of commission paid to OTCs, increased discounting and greater incentives for consumers to join closed user groups as such travel service providers expand their offerings.
Google's Android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world. As a result, Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. Further, Google is the leading Internet search service and has leveraged its search popularity to promote its travel meta-search services. Similarly, Apple, the producer of, among other things, the iPhone and iPad, obtained a patent for "iTravel," a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation. In addition, Apple's iPhone operating system includes "Wallet," a virtual wallet app that holds tickets, boarding passes, coupons and gift cards, and, along with iTravel, may be indicative of Apple's intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity. Apple has substantial market share in the smartphone category and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than we have. Apple may use, expand and/or integrate iTravel, Wallet, Siri (Apple's voice recognition "concierge" service), Apple Pay (Apple's mobile payment system) or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the travel reservations marketplace. To the extent Apple or Google use their mobile operating systems, app distribution channels or, in the case of Google, search services, to favor their own travel service offerings, our business and results of operations could be harmed.

Operations and Technology

Our business is supported by multiple systems and platforms, which were designed with an emphasis on scalability, performance and reliability.  The platforms are generally independent among our brands, though some systems have become increasingly connected or shared.  Our software platforms and architecture use a variety of widely-used software tools and database systems.  
  These internal platforms were designed to include open application protocol interfaces that can provide connectivity to vendors in the industries in which we operate.  These include large global systems, such as accommodation, airline ticket and rental car reservation systems and financial service providers, as well as individual accommodation service providers, such as individual hotels.  Our applications utilize digital certificates to help us conduct secure communications and transactions, as appropriate. The systems infrastructure and web and database servers of our worldwide operations are primarily hosted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, Hong Kong and four locations in the United States, each of which provides network connectivity, networking infrastructure and 24-hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data centers.  All data center facilities have a continuous power supply system, generators, redundant servers and multiple back-up systems.  Although we take steps to mitigate the effects of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facilities, if a hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced a disruption in service for any reason, we could experience a disruption to our services, loss of transactions and revenue and consumer complaints. 
We provide customer service through a mix of in-house call centers and outsourced third-party services.
Intellectual Property

Over time and through acquisitions, we have assembled a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our services. We regard the protection of our intellectual property as critical to our success. We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on national, federal, state and common law rights in the United States and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures, regulations, conventions and treaties. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in our services. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We also have procured various intellectual property licenses from third parties. 
As we deem appropriate, we pursue the registration of our intellectual property, such as domain names, trademarks and service marks, in the United States and internationally. We currently hold various issued patents and pending patent applications.  We file additional patent applications on new inventions, as we deem appropriate. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation. As we continue to expand internationally, protecting our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights involves an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful in every location. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors - "We face risks related to our intellectual property."
Seasonality
A meaningful amount of our gross bookings are generated early in the year, as customers plan and reserve their spring and summer vacations in Europe and North America. However, historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these bookings until the travel is completed (on “check-out”), which can be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. Beginning on January 1, 2018, we began recognizing revenue for financial reporting purposes in our 2018 financial statements when the travel begins (on “check-in”), which can also be in a quarter other than when the reservation is booked. In contrast, we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activities as the expense is incurred, which, in the case of performance advertising in particular, is typically in the quarter in which associated reservations are booked. As a result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue, we have historically experienced our highest levels of profitability in the second and third quarters of the year, which is when we experience the highest levels of accommodation check-outs for the year for our European and North American businesses. We expect this to continue under our new revenue recognition policy. The first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience volatility in earnings growth rates due to these and other seasonal timing factors. For our Asia-Pacific business, we experience the highest levels of accommodation bookings in the third and fourth quarters of the year, and the highest levels of travel consumption in the fourth quarter. As the relative growth rates for these businesses fluctuate, the quarterly distribution of our operating results may vary.
 7

In recent years, we experienced an expansion of the booking window (the average time between the making of a travel reservation and the travel), which impacts the relationship between our gross bookings (recognized at the time of booking) and our revenue and gross profit (recognized at the time of check-out or, after January 1, 2018, at the time of check-in).  Recently, we have seen a modest contraction of the booking window. Future changes in the booking window may cause additional differences between our gross bookings growth rates and revenue growth rates.
Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, the timing of revenue recognition for travel reservation services will change. For example, revenue for accommodation reservation services, which is primarily recognized at check-out under the current accounting standard, will change to be recognized at check-in under the new revenue standard. We currently expect this timing change will not have a significant impact to our annual revenues and net income, although the effects on quarterly revenues and net income are expected to be more significant because a meaningful amount of travel typically starts in December each year and is completed in January of the following year. Under the new revenue standard, this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter each year rather than the first quarter of the following year. Therefore, we estimate that revenue will be more than 2% lower in first quarter of 2018, slightly less than 1% lower in second and third quarters of 2018 and 4% higher in fourth quarter of 2018 recognized at check-in, as it is under the new revenue standard, than it would have been if recognized at check-out, as it would have been under the current accounting standard.
In addition, the date on which certain holidays fall can have an impact on our quarterly results. For example, in 2017, our second quarter year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were positively impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Conversely, our first quarter 2017 year-over-year growth rates in revenue, gross profit, operating income and operating margins were adversely impacted by Easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter, as it did in 2016. Similar to 2017, in 2018 Easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter. However, because Easter will be on April 1, 2018 and we expect that a meaningful amount of Easter travel will commence in the week leading up to Easter, which is during the first quarter 2018, we expect that Easter will have a negative effect on our second quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates and a positive effect on our first quarter 2018 year-over-year growth rates due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from "check-out" to "check-in." The timing of other holidays such as Chinese New Year, Carnival and Ramadan can also impact our quarterly year-over-year growth rates.
The impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross bookings growth rate of the business. For example, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate substantially decelerates, our operating margins typically benefit from relatively less variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by decelerating gross bookings growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservations booked in previous quarters. Conversely, in periods where our gross bookings growth rate accelerates, our operating margins are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense. In addition, gross profit growth is typically less impacted by accelerating gross bookings growth in the near term as a portion of the revenue recognized from such gross bookings will occur in future quarters.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 22,900 employees, of which approximately 4,200 were based in the United States and approximately 18,700 were based outside the United States. We also retain independent contractors to support our customer service, website content translation and system support functions.

We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Although we have works councils or employee representatives in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union and are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, integrate, retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel, for whom competition is intense. See Part I Item 1A Risk Factors -"We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed."
