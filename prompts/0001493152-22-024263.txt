ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
 
8i Acquisition 2 Corp. (“8i,” “LAX” “we,” “us,” “the “Company,” or “our”) is a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on January 21, 2021 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more target businesses.
 
On November 24, 2021, 8i consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 7,500,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one ordinary share of the Company, no par value per share (the “Ordinary Share”), one warrant (“Warrant”) to purchase one-half of one Ordinary Share and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $75,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments which the underwriters exercised in full and closed simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 8,625,000 units at a price of $10.00 per Unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $86,250,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Meng Dong (James) Tan, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, of 292,250 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $2,922,500.
 
The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units.
 
The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
As of November 24, 2021, a total of $86,250,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders.
 
The 8i Units, 8i Ordinary Shares, 8i Warrants, and 8i Rights are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, under the symbols “LAXXU,” “LAX,” “LAXXW,” and “LAXXR,” respectively. The 8i Units commenced trading on Nasdaq on November 22, 2021, and the 8i Ordinary Shares, Warrants, and Rights commenced separate trading from the 8i Units on December 14, 2021.
 
8i’s principal executive offices are located at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street #08-13 Singapore 059817, and its telephone number is +65-6788 0388.
 
Recent Developments
 
Entry into Share Purchase Agreement
 
On April 11, 2022, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with EUDA Health Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company (“EUDA Health”), Watermark Developments Limited, a British Virgin Islands business company (the “Seller”) and Kwong Yeow Liew, acting as Representative of the Indemnified Parties (the “Indemnified Party Representative”). Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, a business combination between us and EUDA Health (the “Business Combination”) will be effected through the purchase by LAX of all of the issued and outstanding shares of EUDA Health from the Seller (the “Share Purchase”). On May 30, 2022, the parties amended the SPA to extend the time for LAX to complete its financial, operational and legal due diligence review of EUDA Health from May 31, 2022 to June 15, 2022. On June 10, 2022, the parties to the SPA, as amended, entered into a second amendment of the SPA, pursuant to which parties agreed to (i) reduce the initial consideration to be paid at closing of the Share Purchase; and (ii) reduce the earnout payments. 
 
At the time the SPA was signed, Mr. Meng Dong (James) Tan, 8i’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the 8i Board of Directors owned 10% equity interests in the Seller. 8i received a fairness opinion from EverEdge Global to the effect that the purchase price to be paid by 8i for the shares of EUDA Health pursuant to the SPA is fair to 8i shareholders from a financial point of view (the “Fairness Opinion”). Through his two wholly-owned companies, 8i Enterprises Pte Ltd. and 8i Capital Limited, Mr. Tan purchased additional equity interests in the Seller for $400,000 on August 16, 2022. Mr. Tan currently owns 33.3% of the equity interests of the Seller.

In connection with the closing of the transactions under the SPA the current officers and directors of EUDA Health will become the officers and directors of 8i. 8i’s sponsor, 8i Holdings 2 Pte. Ltd. (the “Sponsor”), will have the right to nominate one director to serve as an independent director on the post-closing Board of Directors.
 
The Company’s Board of Directors have (i) approved and declared advisable the SPA, the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the SPA and related transactions by the shareholders of the Company.
 
Consideration under the Share Purchase Agreement
 
Initial Consideration
 
Pursuant to the SPA, the initial consideration to be paid at Closing (the “Initial Consideration”) by 8i to Seller for the Share Purchase will be an amount equal to $140,000,000. The Initial Consideration will be payable in 14,000,000 8i Ordinary Shares, no par value (the “Purchaser Shares”) valued at $10 per share. To secure Seller’s obligations under the indemnification provisions of the SPA, 1,400,000 Purchaser Shares (the “Indemnification Escrow Shares”) shall be withheld from the Purchaser Shares payable at Closing, and be delivered to American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Escrow Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an escrow agreement, by and among 8i, Seller, and the Indemnified Party Representative (the “Escrow Agreement”).
Earnout Payments
 
In addition to the Initial Consideration, the Seller may also receive up to 4,000,000 additional Purchaser Shares as an earnout payments (the “Earnout Shares”) if, within a 3-year period following the Closing, the volume-weighted average price of Purchaser Shares or certain financial metrics equals or exceeds any of the four thresholds (each, a “Triggering Event”) under the terms and conditions set forth in the SPA and related transaction documents:

● | The Seller will be issued 1,000,000 additional Purchaser Shares if during the period beginning on the date of Closing (as defined in the SPA) (the “Closing Date”) and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser Share Price is equal to or greater than Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) after the Closing Date; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Seller will be issued 1,000,000 additional Purchaser Shares if during the period beginning on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the Purchaser Share Price is equal to or greater than Twenty Dollars ($20.00); 
● | The Seller will be issued 1,000,000 additional Purchaser Shares if the consolidated audited financial statements of EUDA Health for the fiscal year commencing January 1, 2023 and ending December 31, 2023, reflect that EUDA Health has achieved both of the following financial metrics for such fiscal year: (x) revenues of at least $20,100,000 and (y) net income attributable to EUDA Health of at least $3,600,000. 
● | The Seller will be issued 1,000,000 additional Purchaser Shares if the consolidated audited financial statements of EUDA Health for the fiscal year commencing January 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024, reflect that EUDA Health has achieved both of the following financial metrics for such fiscal year: (x) revenues of at least $40,100,000 and (y) net income attributable to EUDA Health of at least $10,100,000. 

Restrictions on Alternative Transactions
 
Each of Seller and 8i has agreed that from the date of the SPA until the Closing, it will not, among other things, (i) initiate any negotiations with any person concerning an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction (as such terms are defined in the SPA), (ii) enter into any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle relating to such Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality agreement or anti-takeover laws, or (iv) otherwise knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions, or negotiations or any effort or attempt by any person to make an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

Other Agreements Relating to the Business Combination
 
Lock-up Agreement
 
In connection with the Closing, the Seller has agreed, subject to certain customary exceptions, not to (i) offer, sell contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Lockup Shares (as defined below), (ii) enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of the Lock-Up Shares or otherwise or engage in any short sales or other arrangement with respect to the Lock-Up Shares or (iv) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii) until the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date (the “Lock-up Period,” which period may, upon written agreement of 8i and the Seller, be reduced for one or more holders of the Lockup Shares). The term “Lockup Shares” mean the Purchaser Shares and the Earnout Shares, if any, delivered as earnout payment, whether or not earned prior to the end of the Lock-up Period, and including any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or representing the rights to receive ordinary shares of 8i after the Closing.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
 
At the Closing, 8i will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement”) with certain existing stockholders of 8i and with the Seller with respect to their shares of 8i acquired before or pursuant to the Share Purchase, and including the shares issuable on conversion of the warrants issued to the Sponsor in connection with 8i’s initial public offering and any shares issuable on conversion of working capital loans from Sponsor to 8i (collectively, the “Registrable Securities”). The agreement amends and restates the registration rights agreement 8i entered into on November 22, 2021 in connection with its initial public offering. No later than seven (7) calendar days from the closing, the Company will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of all or such maximum portion of the Registrable Securities as permitted by the SEC. The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the Company’s securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.
Seller Release
 
The Seller has agreed to release 8i, EUDA Health, and all of their respective past and present officers, directors, managers, stockholders, members, employees, agents, predecessors, subsidiaries, affiliates, estates, successors, assigns, partners and attorneys (each, a “Released Party”) to the maximum extent permitted by law, from any and all claims, obligations, rights, liabilities or commitments of any nature whatsoever against 8i, EUDA Health, or any of the Released Parties, arising at or prior to the Closing, or related to any act, omission or event occurring, or condition existing, at or prior to the Closing. The Seller does not release 8i, EUDA Health, or any of the Released Parties from claims arising after the date of the Seller Release, any of the other ancillary agreements to the SPA, or any organizational or governing documents or, of any indemnification agreements with, 8i or any of its subsidiaries.
 
The Business Combination is expected to be consummated after obtaining the required approval by the shareholders of 8i and EUDA Health and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.
 
In connection with the Business Combination, we filed a preliminary proxy statement and will file relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including a definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A. Promptly after filing our definitive proxy statement with the SEC, we will mail the definitive proxy statement and a proxy card to each stockholder entitled to vote at the special meeting relating to the acquisition. INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS OF 8i ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION THAT 8i WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT 8i, EUDA HEALTH AND THE SPA. For more information about the Business Combination, please refer to the preliminary proxy statement, the definitive proxy statement and other relevant materials in connection with the acquisition, and any other documents filed by us with the SEC, which may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or by writing to us at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street, #08-13 The Central, Singapore 059817.

General
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Experienced Management Team with Proven Track Record
 
Together with our management team, we believe we have a broad network of contacts and corporate relationship that makes us efficient at:
 

● | Sourcing and evaluating businesses, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Bridging cultural differences to negotiate and execute a transaction in a timely and professional manner 

 
By leveraging our management team’s special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) experience, performing disciplined due diligence, being cautious downside protection, and providing post-acquisition value-add capabilities, we believe that we will be able to acquire a target business that will achieve significant returns for investors.
 
Status as a Publicly Listed Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.
Strong Financial Position and Flexibility
 
With the funds held in our trust account, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from the IPO, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing.
Acquisition Strategy
 
Our acquisition strategy will seek to capitalize on M&A and operational expertise and relationship of both our management team and our board of directors, to identify attractive businesses that have capacity to grow rapidly by utilizing a public vehicle. Our selection process will leverage our team’s network of industry, private equity and business community relationships as well as relationship with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We intend to focus on companies where we believe the combination of our relationships, capital and capital markets expertise and operating experience of Mr. Tan, can help accelerate the target business’ growth and performance.

There is no restriction in the geographic location of targets that we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize geographic locations in Asia (excluding China), where our management team has extensive experience. Our Articles of Association prohibit us from undertaking our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
Investment Criteria
 
The focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:
Growth Potential
 
As a result of the Asia region’s strong growth over the past several decades, the region has become home to a large number of small domestic and regional companies, which are serving the ever-increasing needs of economies locally. While such companies have performed relatively well, the vast majority of these companies suffer from a lack of insightful strategy, insufficient capital, operational inefficiencies and various succession issues (as many companies are first-generation and family-owned). This has also resulted in high degree of market fragmentation, without any established regional market leaders. We will seek target businesses in Asia (excluding China), for which we can provide strategic advice, access to sufficient capital and effective operational expertise, to grow the business.
 
Our Articles of Association prohibit us from undertaking our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
Long-term Revenue Visibility with Defensible Market Position
 
We intend to seek target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition may help facilitate growth.
Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities)
 
We intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business’ earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.
Potential Benefit from Globalization Trends and Possession of Competitive Advantages
 
Target companies exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our company specific analysis and due diligence review. For a potential target company, this process will include, among other things, a review and analysis of the company’s capital structure, quality of earnings, potential for operational improvements, corporate governance, customers, material contracts, and industry background and trends. We intend to leverage the operational experience and disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities to unlock value that our experience in complex situations allows us to pursue.
 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.

Other Acquisition Considerations
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Management Operating and Investing Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.
 
As more fully discussed in “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands’ Companies Law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Ordinary Shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior January 31, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.

We are currently a “foreign private issuer” as defined in Rule 405, but are voluntarily choosing to register and report using domestic forms. We are required to determine our status as a foreign private issuer for the 2023 fiscal year as of the last day of our second quarter. On such date, if we no longer qualify as a “foreign private issuer” (as set forth in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act), we will then become subject to the U.S. domestic issuer rules as of the first day of our 2023 fiscal year, or August 1st.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. Our Articles of Association prohibit us from undertaking our initial business combination with any entity that conducts a majority of its business or is headquartered in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; 
● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination; 
● | our outstanding warrants, rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts to Maxim Group LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination; 
● | our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates; 
● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and 
● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.

Employees
 
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
