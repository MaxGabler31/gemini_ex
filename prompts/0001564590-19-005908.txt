 BUSINESS 
 Overview 
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “we,” “us”, “our”, “the Company” and “BSQUARE” refer to BSQUARE Corporation.
 Since our inception, our business has largely been focused on providing software solutions (historically, including reselling software from Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”)) and related engineering services to businesses that develop, market and sell dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems. Examples of dedicated-purpose standalone intelligent systems include smart, connected computing devices such as smart phones, set-top boxes, point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, as well as smart vending machines, ATM machines, digital signs and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. We focus on systems that utilize various Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as Android, Linux, and QNX, and that are usually connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers include world-class original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), corporate enterprises (“Enterprises”), silicon vendors (“SVs”) and peripheral vendors. A significant portion of our business historically has also been focused on reselling software from Microsoft, from which a majority of our revenue currently continues to be derived.
 Beginning in early 2014, we initiated development efforts focused on new proprietary software products addressing the Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) market, extracting data from uniquely identifiable devices and applying advanced analytics and machine learning to the data in order to derive meaningful and actionable insights. We believe the work we have engaged in since our inception—namely adding intelligence to discrete standalone devices and systems—embodies much of what is central to the core functionality of IIoT. These software development efforts have driven a new business initiative for BSQUARE, which we refer to as DataV™. Our DataV solution includes software products, applications and services that are designed to turn raw IIoT device data into meaningful and actionable data for our customers. 
 We began marketing DataV late in the first quarter of 2016 and announced our first three major customer bookings later that year, which comprised software licensing, software maintenance and related systems integration services. During 2017, we began selling data analytics services and DataV application pilots to major industrial customers primarily in the transportation, oil and gas and manufacturing vertical markets. One of these pilots led to a multi-year software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) agreement in 2018.  The remaining pilots were completed and while no additional licensing arrangements resulted from these pilots, we believe there may be future opportunities with a number of these customers.

We believe that IIoT represents a large, expanding addressable market. We also believe that many potential customers need assistance with their digital transformation activities prior to making long-term solutions commitments, and that these IIoT related services may provide us an inroad to eventual DataV software and services sales. Developing, selling and implementing DataV was our primary focus through 2018. While we will continue to market our DataV software, in 2019 we intend to expand our efforts to market IIOT related services that may or may not include DataV.  We will continue to invest in the development of our DataV software in support of existing customer commitments and new customer opportunities.  We intend to continue to run our legacy software resale business to maximize cash flow for the foreseeable future. Our legacy professional engineering services business is now managed as a part of our overall services business, which we anticipate will increasingly serve our DataV software and IIOT services customers.  We were incorporated in the State of Washington in July 1994. Our principal office is located at 110 110th Avenue NE, Suite 300, Bellevue, Washington 98004, and our telephone number is (425) 519-5900. 
 Industry Background 
 The IIoT market continues to emerge and evolve. We continue to believe it presents a large market opportunity for sales of both our software and related services. This market includes consumer, business, government and industrial segments. It encompasses services, software, hardware, connectivity and cloud providers as well as systems integrators. While larger research firms do not yet widely track the size of the IIoT market, available research indicates to us that over time, the deployment of hundreds of billions of connected devices may generate substantial economic value.
 The IIoT marketplace is currently being influenced by the following factors: 
  
• | Development of machine learning and data analytics software that advances the understanding of complex systems but lacks the capability to effectively process the proliferation of resulting data. This provides an opportunity for solutions such as DataV to develop models of complex mechanical equipment that can be used for predictive reasoning;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nearly ubiquitous wireless connectivity, including near-field communications (or NFC), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular, allowing connectivity and data exchange with large populations of small, remote, and frequently mobile devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing competitive pressures that are forcing a wide array of businesses to invest in automation as a way to improve productivity, reduce costs, and enhance the value of their own offerings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The increasing availability of inexpensive cloud computing and storage capabilities able to scale to the extent likely to be demanded by IIoT.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources of Revenue
 Our revenue in 2017 and 2018 was derived from the following sources:

Software
 DataV Software
 DataV is BSQUARE’s proprietary comprehensive software solution which addresses a variety of business use cases specific to IIoT applications, including:
  
• | Predictive Failure: By employing machine learning and advanced data analytics, DataV can predict, with varying levels of accuracy, future operational conditions for equipment or devices that are part of the overall IIoT system. For many industrial concerns, the operational condition of greatest interest is a failure state. By being able to predict failures before they occur, DataV customers can take steps to remediate the condition more quickly, less expensively and with less operational disruption.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adaptive Diagnostics: For equipment that has already failed, DataV can dynamically proscribe diagnostic and repair steps that have the highest probability of quickly and more cost-effectively resolving the problem. DataV employs machine learning, data analytics, and historical repair data to help customers identify underperforming assets and proscribe remediation steps to optimize performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IIoT Device Management: The spread of data-generating devices in IIoT systems introduces a new set of operational problems for industrial concerns. DataV can facilitate IIoT device management, including software and configuration updates, over large-scale populations of connected devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our DataV solution is designed to be implemented in a wide variety of industrial sectors and vertical markets, including commercial transportation, oil and gas extraction, manufacturing, water and power and other vertical markets. These industrial sectors share common operational characteristics, such as the dependence on complex capital equipment where the cost of failure or sub-optimal performance is relatively high. In other cases, our customers are seeking new revenue-generating products or services to enhance operating profitability. We currently provide DataV software through a SaaS model.
 We began marketing DataV in early 2016 and secured three contracts for deployment.  The first order was from PACCAR, Inc., a heavy-duty truck manufacturer, to employ adaptive diagnostics in order to more rapidly service and repair trucks. This order, valued at $4.3 million, included a perpetual license for DataV, as well as custom systems integration services and annual software maintenance fees. The second DataV order was from Itron, Inc., a large global manufacturer of electric, water, and gas meters for utilities as well as smart city solutions, and targeted IIoT device management. This order, valued at $4.8 million, included $1.9 million for the first year and a $2.9 million four-year extension option, and included a subscription license to use DataV in addition to maintenance and systems integration services. In November 2017, Itron exercised its extension option and renewed its DataV subscription. The third DataV order was from a global provider of candy and beverages to help fulfill their smart vending initiative to add intelligence and to better track in real time, existing fleets of vending machines. This deployment was rolled out in phases beginning in the first quarter of 2018 in selected European geographies.  
 In 2017, we entered into 19 DataV pilots.  In early 2018, one of these pilots led to a multi-year SaaS and related services agreement, initially valued at $2.6 million, with a Fortune 100 global brand to employ DataV to manage a large fleet of distributed equipment.  The remaining pilots were completed and, while no additional licensing arrangements transpired from these pilots, we believe there may be future opportunities with a number of these customers. In 2019, as we begin to increasingly focus on selling our IIoT-related services, we intend to limit our investments in DataV software solutions and applications to meet clear customer demand.
 Other Proprietary Software
 Apart from DataV, we currently offer the following proprietary software products:
  
• | HTML5 Rendering Engine—Our HTML5 Rendering Engine is based on the open-source WebKit platform that is maintained by a number of leading internet and device companies. Using WebKit, device makers can create portable applications and user interfaces for their devices using the industry-standard HTML5 markup language; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TestQuestTM 10—TestQuest 10 is our testing automation tool that provides customers with a complete test solution that brings together everything necessary to test connected devices, including tools to create and manage test cases, a platform that allows teams to collaborate on test development, and a reporting tool that allows customers to analyze test results.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By the end of 2016, we had reduced our research and development efforts on these products as our focus has shifted to our DataV solution.

Third-Party Software
 We have distribution agreements with multiple third-party software vendors. Our ability to resell these third-party software products, whether as stand-alone products or in conjunction with our own proprietary software and engineering service offerings, provides our customers with a comprehensive solution source for their device project needs. Our primary third-party software offerings include the following: 
  
• | For over 20 years, we have been a Microsoft authorized Value-Added Provider (“VAP”) of Windows Embedded operating systems and toolkits for the complete line of Windows Embedded products, including major product families such as Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard and Windows Embedded Server. Effective March 1, 2019, pursuant to a new Global Partnership Agreement with Microsoft, we are authorized to sell Windows Embedded operating systems in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Curacao, Aruba, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, U.S. Virgin Islands, Grenada, Dominica, Cayman Islands, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Sint Maarten, Turks and Caicos Islands, Saint Martin, British Virgin Islands, Sint Eustatius, Saba, Anguilla, Montserrat, Colombia, Saint Barthelemy, Antigua and Barbuda. Of our total revenue, 75% in 2018 and 70% in 2017 resulted from the sale of Windows Embedded operating systems. Our existing distribution agreement for sales of Windows Embedded operating systems in the European Union (“E.U.”), the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa, from which we generated approximately 3.7% of our third-party software sales in 2018, expires on June 30, 2019 and will not be renewed thereafter. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have been a Microsoft authorized VAP of Windows Mobile operating systems since November 2009. Along with Windows Mobile operating systems, we also sell Microsoft’s Office Mobile product. We are currently authorized to sell Windows Mobile operating systems and related products in North America, South America, Central America (excluding Cuba), Japan, Taiwan, and the region comprised of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). Of our total revenue in 2018, 6% was generated through the sale of Windows Mobile operating systems, compared to 10% in 2017. Our current distribution agreements related to Windows Mobile operating systems expire on April 30, 2022;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are an authorized distributor for Adobe Flash technologies and Adobe Reader. We have the right to distribute Adobe Flash Lite licenses on a worldwide basis; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are an authorized distributor of Intel Corporation’s Embedded Security product in North America.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The sale of Microsoft operating systems has accounted for substantially all of our third-party software revenue historically, including approximately 97% of third-party software revenue in 2018 and 98% in 2017.
 
Professional Engineering Services
 Traditional Professional Engineering Services (PES) 
 Our traditional services business has served hundreds of customers for over two decades. This work is concentrated on embedded software engineering for small, remote devices.  Customers engage us for engineering services due to our extensive experience in the areas of device software development and testing, as well as embedded and mobile operating systems. We believe that engaging us on a new device design typically results in shorter development cycles and reduced time-to-market, lower overall costs to complete projects, and enhanced product robustness and features, which a customer may otherwise have been unable to achieve.  
 Revenue from professional engineering services derived from our engagement with a national Fortune 100 brand was $4.2 million, or 50%, of total revenue from these services in 2018, and $3.7 million, or 36%, of total professional engineering services revenue in 2017.
 Revenue derived from our engagement with Google was $1.0 million, or 12%, of our total revenue from professional engineering services in 2018 and $2.9 million, or 28% of such revenue in 2017.
 IoT-Related Services
 Upon launching of our DataV software solutions in 2016, we also began providing integration and customization services as  a significant element of each software sale. These services are required to integrate DataV into the customer's environment, develop custom applications that use DataV, and, in many cases, operate the DataV solution for the customer. DataV services account for roughly half of the contract value of our DataV deployments, based on our understanding of customer needs ahead of their readiness to address digital transformation.

In late 2018 we launched a new services offering  focused on helping  businesses employ IIoT-enabled  remote devices, integrate these devices into cloud IIoT services offered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure, apply machine learning and advanced analytics to the data generated by these remote devices, and operationalize resulting insights.
 Starting in 2019, IIoT-related services will become our primary sales focus and will include the following service offerings:
  
• | data science consulting;
--+-------------------------


• | IIoT edge integration;
--+-----------------------


• | AWS IIoT integration;
--+----------------------


• | Azure IIoT integration;
--+------------------------


• | managed hosting;
--+-----------------


• | development operations consulting; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | custom application development.
--+--------------------------------

 We manage all professional services activities under one operating umbrella.
 Strategy 
 Our strategy is to expand our IIoT service offerings building on our historic business selling embedded system software, our traditional engineering services business, and as a complement to our software sales.  We will continue to invest in the development of our proprietary software, including DataV in support of existing customer commitments and new customer opportunities.  We intend to leverage our long-standing relationship with Microsoft selling embedded system software and build on that relationship in partnership with Microsoft’s Azure and IIOT sales and marketing teams.  We will also build on our new relationship with the AWS team.
Relationship with Microsoft
 We have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft and this relationship is important to the continuing success of our business. Our credentials as a Microsoft partner include: 

• | We have been one of Microsoft’s largest distributors of Windows Embedded operating systems for over 20 years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have been a distributor of Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating systems since November 2009;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We were the OED Americas Channel Sales & Marketing Award recipient for Distributor Sales Excellence in 2013;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We are a Silver Data Analytics partner;
--+----------------------------------------


• | We are a Silver Data Platform partner;
--+---------------------------------------


• | We are a Co-Sell Ready ISV Partner for Microsoft; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Microsoft has engaged us from time to time on various engineering service engagements.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel. We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including: 
  
• | We gain early access to new Microsoft embedded software and other technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We leverage co-marketing resources, content and strategies from Microsoft, including market development funds, to support our own marketing and sales efforts;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We participate in Microsoft-sponsored trade shows, seminars, and other events;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We receive sales leads from Microsoft; and
--+-------------------------------------------


• | We receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.

Sales and Marketing 
 We market our products and professional engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel throughout the United States and in the United Kingdom. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. In late 2018 we entered into a three-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement with AWS. This agreement provides funding for research and development and sales and marketing programs that are intended to help accelerate the growth of IoT business initiatives for both us and AWS. As part of this agreement, AWS became the preferred cloud provider for DataV customers. Additionally, in late 2018 we expanded our partnership with Microsoft to include distribution of Windows Embedded operating systems to include new partners within the Microsoft IoT ecosystem and Azure IoT cloud integration services.  Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs and a comprehensive website.
Research and Development 
 During 2018, substantially all of our research and development personnel were dedicated to the design, development and release of DataV software. Moving into 2019, we intend to limit our investments in DataV software to meet clear customer demand, drawing down personnel dedicated to DataV software development and increasing personnel dedicated to delivering IIoT-related services.
Customers 
 Targeted customers for DataV services and software solutions include large industrial concerns that either manufacture capital assets, such as a heavy-duty commercial truck manufacturer, or rely on the widespread deployment of capital assets in the operation of their businesses, such as a large for-hire fleet operator. DataV customers may also include manufacturers incorporating DataV within their own offerings in order to enhance capabilities, such as an electric meter manufacturer developing smart grid technology for power utilities.
 Customers purchasing third-party software and our other proprietary software solutions and professional engineering services include leading OEMs, ODMs, Enterprises, SVs and peripheral vendors. Representative customers include Honeywell International, Inc., Hewlett Packard, Google, Elo Touch Solutions, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Oracle, Omnicell, and several industrial handset companies. 
 Competition 
 The IIoT market is still emerging but is already becoming increasingly competitive. Our competitors in this space include, or we anticipate could include, the following:
  
• | Large, established enterprise software and solution providers such as IBM, SAS, Oracle and SAP;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cloud IIoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC ThingWorx; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Startups funded to enter the IIoT market, including C3IOT and others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we anticipate that we will encounter increasing competition in the growing IIoT market from a number of additional software and service providers as we continue to  focus on this market in 2019 and beyond and as we expand our focus on providing IIoT-related service offerings.
 The market for device software and engineering services is competitive. We face competition from the following: 
  
• | Our current and potential customers’ internal engineering and research and development departments, which may seek to provide their own IIoT-related services and/or develop their own software solutions which could compete with our IIoT service offerings and proprietary software products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engineering service firms, including off-shore development companies, such as Adeneo, SymphonyTeleca and Wipro;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, with their own software development capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Contract manufacturers with their own software development capabilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6
 

 
• | Mobile and embedded test automation providers including Perfecto Mobile, mVerify, JAMO Solutions, SmartBear Software (AutomatedQA), TestPlant (eggPlant) and Keynote, as well as our customers’ and potential customers’ internally created tools and manual testing capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Microsoft Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Arrow Electronics, Inc. Avnet, Inc. and Synnex Corporation; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Marketing agencies and specialized vendors who provide mobile application services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our services and software solutions, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with AWS or Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.
 Neither AWS nor Microsoft has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete against us. Amazon may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring in-house more of the core-embedded development services and expertise that we currently provide, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows operating system software and services, including in the evolving IIoT market. These systems integrators may be given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are. 
 International Operations 
 Our international operations outside of North America consist principally of engineering services operations in Taipei, Taiwan and Trowbridge, England. Prior to mid-2018 we also maintained a sales and sales support office in Tokyo, Japan. Because our OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows Embedded operating systems (e.g. Windows Embedded Compact) was previously restricted to North America, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. Revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was approximately 6% of total revenue in both 2018 and 2017.  Our distribution rights for Microsoft Windows Embedded products in the E.U., the European Free Trade Association, Turkey and Africa expires on June 30, 2019 and will not be renewed; accordingly, we do not plan to make additional sales and marketing investments during 2019 in those regions.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for more information regarding our international operations. 
 Personnel 
 Our headcount by area was as follows: 
 
 
 | December 31, | 
----------------------------------------------------------+--------------+----
 | 2018 | | 2017
Professional engineering services | | 36 | | 51 
Sales, marketing and administrative | | 40 | | 78 
Research and product development | | 63 | | 63 
Total employees | | 139 | | 192
Contractors (primarily professional engineering services) | | 12 | | 6 
Total headcount | | 151 | | 198

 
Of the total headcount at December 31, 2018, 106 were located in North America, 19 in Taiwan and 26 in the United Kingdom. As conditions necessitate, professional engineering service employees may perform research and development activities and vice versa.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 
 In general, we strive to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to, or competitive with, those developed by us. 
 Additionally, because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third-party software products, we also rely on our partners, particularly Microsoft, to appropriately protect their own intellectual property. 
 As of January 31, 2019, we had fourteen pending United States (“US”) patent applications related to DataV, in addition to nine issued US patents related to other products and services. We also have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions. We will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property.
 See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information regarding our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
