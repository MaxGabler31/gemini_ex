Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Background.
 
Focus Universal Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a Nevada corporation involved in two separate industries: (1) a provider of handheld sensor devices and wholesaler of various air filters; and (2) a universal smart instrument platform developer.
 
We are based in the city of Walnut, California, and were incorporated in Nevada in 2012. In December 2013, we filed an S-1 registration statement that went effective on March 14, 2014.
 
Our website is www.focusuniversal.com. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Focus Universal Inc. is a universal smart instrumentation platform developer and universal smart device manufacturer. We are also a wholesaler of various air filtration systems. We are also researching, developing, and manufacturing a universal smart instrument device and working on specializing in the development and commercialization of such universal smart technologies and instruments. We define universal smart technology as commercial technology with an integrated platform, which provides a unique and universal solution for test and measurement made up of off-the-shelf parts. We are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that use the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules.
 
Our universal smart instrumentation technology features a Universal Smart Instrumentation Platform (“USIP”) generalizes instruments into a reusable foundation representing a majority part of the instruments, and architecture-specific components (sensor modules), which together replaces the functions of traditional instruments at a fraction of their cost. The USIP has an open architecture incorporating a variety of individual instrument functions, sensors and probes from different industries and vendors. The platform features the ability to connect thousands of sensors or probes. This technology addresses major limitations with traditional hardware and represents another technological advancement in the Internet of Things marketplace. We call this device the “Ubiquitor” because it can be used to wirelessly measure and test a variety of electrical and physical phenomena such as voltage, current, temperature, pressure, sound, light, and humidity.
 
The Ubiquitor, which we have created and have manufactured in limited quantities, utilizes a standard desktop computer with Mac OS, Windows OS, an Android-based or iOS-based smartphone, or mobile tablet device as a platform that communicates with a group of sensors or probes manufactured by different vendors in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of their unique characteristics. The data readout is displayed on the computer, smartphone, or tablet display in a program or application we have created for Windows PC and are creating for MacOS. We are designing the application software (the “App”) to have a graphical representation of control and indicator elements common in real instruments such as knobs, buttons, dials, and graphs, etc. Our developers are designing and implementing a soft control touch screen interface which supports real-time data monitoring and facilitates instrument control and operation.
 
Until March 31, 2016, we offered a full range of web services, including web marketing services, social and viral marketing campaigns, search engine optimization consulting, and web analytics implementation. We generated our revenue from providing these services to small and medium sized businesses. We focused on providing one-off services, such as development of a fully functioning website or creation of a marketing strategy plan, to small business clients.
 
Through a merger with Perfecular Inc., we strategically expanded our services to the manufacture and marketing of high-tech electronic devices. We sell handheld sensor systems and filters wholesaler to distribution platforms and are working on developing the App and the Ubiquitor. We are also researching the development of an anti-counterfeit authentication technology that we believe could address the problem of counterfeit production by attempting to authenticate consumer goods.

Scientific Instrument Research, Development and Sales
 
Industry Background and Overview
 
Through our acquisition of Perfecular Inc., we entered into the scientific instrument industry, specifically the instrument sensor industry. Instrument sensors are devices specifically designed and constructed for sensing and measuring physical variables that are useful in: (i) industrial operations; (ii) environmental, commercial and medical applications; (iii) research and development in a variety of industries; and (iv) the daily lives of electronics consumers.
 
We believe that instrument sensors are important in modern science, having applications in both the industrial and educational fields. In recent years, significant progress has been made in instruments and instrumentation systems. The performance of measuring and monitoring instruments has improved considerably in the computer age. Analog instruments are used to indicate the magnitude of the quantity in the form of pointer movements. Digital instruments, on the other hand, specify the quantity in a digital readout format, they can be read easily, and are more accurate than the analog multi-meters because the pointer movements can be easily misread and are often not permanently stored, reducing interpolation and reading errors. Digital instruments offer significant advantages over analog devices. The auto-polarity function of digital devices prevents various problems. Parallax error which occurs when the pointer of an analog instrument is viewed from a different angle, which may cause users to see and read a different value are eliminated as well. Digital instruments are free from wear and potential shock failures because they have no moving parts. With the advancements in technology of integrated circuits, digital instruments are becoming increasingly compact and accurate. Key market players of analog and digital instruments include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Danaher Corporation, Mettler Toledo, Metrohm USA, Hanna Instruments, Agilent Technologies, and Perkin Elmer.
 
Most modern instruments are digital. They are designed for measuring various physical quantities in objects; and consist of the following functional components:
 

· | Data acquisition. This is the process of sampling signals that measure real world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a microprocessor. The components of data acquisition systems include:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | Sensors, to convert physical parameters to electrical signals; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Signal conditioning circuitry, to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values; 
c. | Analog-to-digital converters, to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values. It normally operates on conditioned signals, that is, signals that have already been filtered and amplified by analog circuits.


· | Storage and communication components. Application-specific input/output (I/O) components. In digital instrumentation systems, the transmission of data between devices is realized relatively easily by using serial or parallel transmission techniques.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ancillaries such as displays and power supplies and application specific software.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Traditional hardware-centered instrumentation systems are made up of multiple stand-alone instruments that are interconnected to carry out a determined measurement or control an operation. They have fixed vendor-defined functionality, are very powerful and large, expensive, and cumbersome. They also require a lot of power, and often have excessive amounts of features that are not user friendly. Users generally cannot extend or customize them easily. The knobs and buttons on the instrument, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature of the instrument.

Instrument inter-operability and connectivity allow the Ubiquitor to communicate and work with other instruments manufactured by different vendors, in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those instruments. Traditional instruments, including traditional hardware-centered instrumentations and software centered virtual instrumentations, are specifically designed, constructed and refined to perform one or more specific tasks. Most of the instruments on the market come with a variety of connectivity technologies and do not have the built-in firmware or software to support the connectivity and inter-operability of instruments without drastically revising the application software across instrument brands. Unfortunately, while the instrument drivers simplify software development and maintenance, they did not address hardware obsolescence since each manufacturer has their own drivers and application and none are compatible, current applications are limited only to large, expensive test and measurement instruments.
 
A universal instrument is a versatile device which combines many individual instrument functions, sensors and probes in a single unit. It has a primary purpose, but also incorporates other instrument’s functionalities. One instrument could perform many different measurements and control and substitute many other instruments. It utilizes a variety of probes to connect to the device for a wide variety of process measurement and control. A universal instrument offers superior sensor or probe compatibility, versatility, inter-operability, connectivity and scalability. Theoretically, it is feasible to design a universal instrument which is compatible with all sensors or probes on the market, and capable of monitoring and controlling any combination of sensors or probes.
 
Despite the undoubted usefulness of the universal instruments, one of the major obstacles that prevent the universal instruments from being adopted by end users is their cost.. The end user who just needs a $10 traditional instrument for his applications certainly does not have the motivation to spend $1000 for functions he does not need. Functionality always needs to be balanced against cost. The knobs and buttons on analog instruments, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature of the instrument, making them very expensive and hard to adapt.
 
Smartphones and tablets have been considered recreational devices for communicating, playing games and streaming videos, but they are also one of the most powerful tools engineers use for designing, validating, and producing products. These ubiquitous smartphones perform better than most instrumentation in many fields. Because of their network connectivity, smartphones and tablets are great tools for remotely viewing measurements. In addition, the processing capabilities have exploded in recent years with processors and data capability rivaling that of very recent laptop computers. Thus,, their small size and processing power also makes them effective for portable measurements. The ubiquity of wireless connectivity, unlimited data plans, and more powerful cellular networks combined with increasing functionality and the speed of connected devices and mobile networks will further drive consumer demand for more cost effective wireless smartphone based instruments. Building an application for a smartphone or tablet and turning a smartphone or tablet to an instrument is not a trivial task. Many of the industrial instrument manufacturers have limited or no expertise programming for mobile platforms and designing wireless hardware. To help industrial instrument manufacturers take advantage of these smart devices, Perfecular Inc., has dedicated many years of research and development efforts into designing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting wireless smart technology and products for industrial measuring instruments.
 
Our universal smart development protocol focuses not only on the design of the hardware and software modules, but also on the design of the overall universal smart instruments system, guided by the structured, universal and modular principles. We make our development open to industrial instrument manufacturers, software, and hardware developers.
 
Compatibility: The compatibility in universal smart instrument system refers not only to the compatibility between the same types of industrial sensor instruments from different manufactures, but also to the compatibility between various industrial instrument types. The full inter-operability and absolute instrument interchangeability is constantly addressed in our development protocol.
 
Universality: It is our goal to incorporate as many functionalities of the traditional industrial sensor instruments into a single unit, allowing different data acquisition sensor modules to execute on the same mobile platform. Thus, the interoperability between various sensors or probes can be achieved.
 
Upgradeability: Most traditional industrial instrument sensor interfaces are unidirectional applications, meaning the instrument performs its task and transmits results to the interface device in one direction only. They only perform monitoring tasks and share a majority of functions of the bi-directional controlling instruments, however, they cannot be upgraded to controllers. End users have to purchase a new controlling instrument for their applications. Taking advantage of the secure bi-directional wireless communications and interface supported by smartphones or mobile devices, universal smart instruments, which deliver data back-and-forth between the smartphones and industrial sensors, can be readily modified or upgraded by adding the corresponding actuators for controlling applications. Sensors or probes measure the output performance of the device being controlled and give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections towards the desired performance.

Expandability and Scalability: Similar to existing sensor network technology, our universal smart instruments are more flexible than sensor networks. They can currently monitor and control hundreds of different sensors or probes. They automatically identify and configure the corresponding graphical user interfaces that are connected to the Universal Smart Instruments. End users are free to add or removes sensors or probes from the universal smart instruments. All communication protocols supported by smartphones are integrated in the software design including WI-FI, blue tooth, cellular network technology and wired form through the audio port on the smartphone.
 
Security: Universal smart instruments have the sensor security built-in data acquisition module and help companies meet sensor security requirements, preventing unauthorized users from accessing the sensor measurements and control. Unauthorized access of the universal smart instruments sensors is forbidden.
 
Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device
 
Our “Ubiquitor,” device will be a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that will use a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules. We have initial functioning prototype devices created and intend to develop this into full-scale production. The Ubiquitor will be a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens. The Ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system will integrate event-monitoring, storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that provides a holistic view of sensor data it is reading.
 
The physical hardware consists of:
 

1. | The sensor probes, which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a USB stick, with both male and female ports; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The main hardware gateway, a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This device can connect up to 2.5 kilometers of sensor instruments, and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen (desktop or mobile displays) using a Wi-Fi connection. Most types of probes can connect to the hardware. If the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size, it is possible to simply use a USB cable to connect the probe and the hub. All data and analytics are displayed on a single screen, with tools that record and keep track of all measurements, and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts.
 
The Ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real time, up to 100hz per second, and thus is intended to be adapted to many industry uses.
 
The Ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent sensor device. Its greatest advantage is universal compatibility. Currently, the Ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate more than 256 different types of sensor heads. Therefore, users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over 256 kinds of sensor readings. With Perfecular’s technology, users only need to obtain the sensor heads, facilitating ease and convenience of use. Using a smartphone, users can collect and analyze data in real time.
 
By using the smartphone as a substitute platform, we believe we will achieve the following efficiencies:
 

1. | Cut production costs. Smartphone technology will advance and become more widely used than the vast majority products on the small sensor device market. By utilizing smartphone technology, the Ubiquitor will add superior functionality and performance, improve the product’s quality and cutting production costs
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product. With the Ubiquitor, we believe that there will be no need for device manufacturers to research and develop the new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop new sensor heads based on our software technology.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Reduce clutter. It is anticipated that the Ubiquitor dispenses with the hassle of hooking up cables, since it is based on wireless transmission of data.

Other Traditional Handheld Meters
 
We also offer an array of traditional handheld meters through our wholesale distribution platform.
 
Filter and Handheld Meter Wholesaler
 
In addition to developing Universal Smart Instrument sensors, we are a wholesaler of various filtration products and digital handheld sensors. We source our products from manufacturers in China and then sell to a major U.S. distributor who resell our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels. Specifically, we sell the following products:

-

Fan Speed Adjuster device. We provide a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal, electronic auto-resetting circuit breaker.
 
Carbon filter devices. We also sell two types of carbon filter devices to distributors. These Carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter, which moves air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.
 
HEPA filtration device. We provide an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and retailers. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in various sizes.
 
Digital light meter. We provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles. The meter we sell is designed to be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light (meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source, the sensor will still read the light correctly). The meter has a built-in low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure to 40,000 FC.
 
Quantum par meter. We provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 umol.
 
Strategy
 
Strategy and Marketing Plan
 
We have designed, manufactured, marketed and distributed our electronic measurement devices, such as temperature humidity meters, digital meters, quantum PAR meters, pH meters, TDS meters and CO2 monitors, for many years and have many loyal customers. The universal smart technology has been applied to our existing traditional devices and demonstrated functionality and hardware cost savings. We believe we have achieved hardware cost savings in the range of 70% to 90%. Prototypes were sent to our customers for demonstrations and evaluation. Currently, we are in the stage of producing a pilot manufacturing run. The first round of pilot production was completed in May, 2016. The second round of pilot production was completed in July 2016.
 
Smartphones are an integral part of our wireless universal smart technology system. Both wireless and wired communication connectivity are used and targeted on different applications. In wired connectivity, the data acquisition module is connected through the audio port in the smartphone. The smartphone is used to replace a traditional instrument. Compared with the wireless solution, the wireless communication module or even the power supply used for data acquisition module are eliminated in the design, as a consequence of this some hardware costs are saved. End users are not able to access the sensors or probes remotely. We believe that the instruments based on wired universal smart technology are not as convenient as their wireless counterparts. Currently, in the industry, however, wired instruments are cheaper.
 
We believe that being the first ones in the market provides a significant and sustained market-share advantage over later competitors. We first focus on our existing instruments and convert them to universal smart devices and market them to our existing customers.
 
We are putting together an internal sales team with the proceeds of the offering in order to get established for the marketing efforts.
 
We believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a critical role for traditional industrial instrument manufacturers, as it is too expensive and difficult to develop industrial instrument sensors for medium or smaller companies. The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them in their products. There are hundreds of thousands of instrument manufacturers and trillion-dollar revenues for this manufacturing industry in China. We plan to open a sales department in China dedicate to promoting our technologies to local instrument manufacturers.

Smartphones have been seamlessly integrated into our daily life. A large number of functions and services have become accessible to the masses through the use of smart phones. The proliferation of the smartphone and its user-friendly interface, which allows access to digital information, will cause these devices to become a crucial part of our wireless universal smart instruments.
 
Our goals over the next three years include:
 

· | Raise capital to move to full manufacturing and production for our Ubiquitor device;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Partner with manufacturers and promote the adoption of our Ubiquitor platform;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire a stable market share of the handheld wireless sensor device market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to develop market share in our wholesale distribution of sensors and filters; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilize our internet marketing strategies to market our handheld sensors and filters.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to achieve these goals, we intend to focus on the following initiatives:
 

· | Position the Ubiquitor product as the industry standard in universal wireless sensor reading technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish strategic supply chain channels to facilitate efficient production operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Communicate the product and service differentiation through direct networking and effective marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution Method
 
We intend to continue to engage in relationships with Chinese manufacturers and then distribute our products to distributors and retailers directly from the Chinese manufacturers and then we intend to distribute the Ubiquitor by selling directly to traditional instrument manufacturers. We believe that traditional instrument manufacturers will adopt this technology since the Ubiquitor device is intended to consolidate various other sensors.
 
We intend to manufacture and market the Ubiquitor and sell it directly to consumers or distributors using internet marketing and also using channels such as Amazon.com and to launch the product through crowdfunding sites like indiegogo and kickstarter.com. We also intend to establish a marketing department overseas in China.
 
Raw Materials
 
The electronic components used in the Ubiquitor are common and can be easily purchased. Production and assembly lines are also available worldwide.
 
Manufacturing and Production
 
We have a limited production facility in California where small and medium sized circuit board production can take place until we have enough sales to convert manufacturing to a large-scale manufacturing facility in China, where we have key strategic relationships with manufacturing facilities.
Competitors
 
There are several competitors we have identified in the wireless sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as Hanna Instruments or Extech Instruments.
 
Hach developed and launched SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 8 SC sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their price-point is still prohibitive to consumers.
 
Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors. Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption. Also, the sensors real-time updates are slow and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition also may be a concern. In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using web-based services.
 
We are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instruments smartphone application, which we believe will be a completely different product category.
