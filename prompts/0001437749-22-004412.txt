Item 1. BUSINESS
 
In this annual report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the words “Gray,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Gray Television, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all station rank, in-market share and television household data herein are derived from reports prepared by Comscore, Inc. (“Comscore”). While we believe this data to be accurate and reliable, we have not independently verified such data nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein and cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such data.
 
General
 
We are a multimedia company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. We are the nation’s largest owner of top-rated local television stations (“television” or “TV”) and digital assets in the United States. Our television stations serve 113 television markets that collectively reach approximately 36 percent of US television households. This portfolio includes 80 markets with the top-rated television station and 100 markets with the first and/or second highest rated television station.  We also own video program companies Raycom Sports, Tupelo Honey, PowerNation Studios and Third Rail Studios which we refer to collectively as our “production companies.”
 
Our operating revenues are derived primarily from broadcast and internet advertising and from retransmission consent fees. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 our total revenue was $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.

Markets and Stations
 
We believe a key driver for our strong market position is our focus on strong local news and information programming. We believe that our market position and our strong local teams have enabled us to maintain more stable revenues compared to many of our peers.
 
We are diversified across our markets and network affiliations. In 2021 and 2020, our largest market, by revenue, was Cleveland-Akron, Ohio and Charlotte, North Carolina which each contributed approximately 4% of our revenue in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our top 10 markets by revenue contributed approximately 23% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our CBS-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 35% of total revenue; our NBC-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 32% of total revenue; our ABC-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 14% of total revenue; and our FOX-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 12% of total revenue. We refer to CBS, NBC, ABC and FOX as the “Big Four” networks.
 
In each of our markets, we own and operate at least one television station broadcasting a primary channel affiliated with one of the Big Four networks. We also own additional stations in some markets, some of which also broadcast primary channels affiliated with one of the Big Four networks. Nearly all of our stations broadcast secondary digital channels that are affiliated with various networks or are independent of any network. The terms of our affiliations with broadcast networks are governed by network affiliation agreements. Each network affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network. Our network affiliation agreements with the Big Four broadcast networks currently expire at various dates through December 2024.
 
Television Industry Background
 
The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) grants broadcast licenses to television stations. There are only a limited number of broadcast licenses available in any one geographic area. Each commercial television station in the US is assigned to one of 210 designated market areas (“DMAs”). These markets are ranked in size according to their number of television households, with the market having the largest number of television households ranked number one (New York City). Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties (and in some cases, portions of counties) in which the home-market commercial television stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours.
 
Television station revenue is derived primarily from local, regional and national advertising revenue and retransmission consent fees. Television station revenue is also derived to a much lesser extent from studio and tower space rental fees and production activities. “Advertising” primarily refers to advertisements broadcast by television stations, but it also includes advertisements placed on a television station’s website and sponsorships of television programming and off-line content such as email messages, mobile applications, and other electronic content distributed by stations. Advertising rates are typically driven by: (i) the size of a station’s market; (ii) a station’s overall ratings; (iii) a program’s popularity among targeted viewers; (iv) the number of advertisers competing for available time; (v) the demographic makeup of the station’s market; (vi) the availability of alternative advertising media in the market; (vii) the presence of effective sales forces; and (viii) the development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming and/or digital content on a station’s website or mobile applications. Advertising rates can also be determined in part by the station’s ratings and market share among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting.
 
Because broadcast stations rely on advertising revenues, they are sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy. The sizes of advertisers’ budgets, which can be affected by broad economic trends, can affect the broadcast industry in general and the revenues of individual broadcast television stations.

Strategy
 
Our success is based on the following strategies:
 
Grow by Leveraging our Diverse National Footprint. We serve a diverse and national footprint of television stations. We currently operate in DMAs ranked between 10 and 209. We operate in many markets that we believe have the potential for significant political advertising revenue in periods leading up to elections. We are also diversified across our broadcast programming.
Maintain and Grow our Market Leadership Position. According to Comscore, during 2021, our owned and operated television stations achieved the #1 ranking in overall audience in 80 of our 113 markets. In addition, our stations achieved the #1 and/or #2 ranking in overall audience in 100 of our 113 markets.
 
We believe there are significant advantages in operating the #1 or #2 television broadcasting stations in a local market. Strong audience and market share allow us to enhance our advertising revenue through price discipline and leadership. We believe a top-rated local news platform is critical to capturing incremental sponsorship and political advertising revenue. Our high-quality station group allows us to generate higher operating margins, which allows us additional opportunities to reinvest in our business to further strengthen our network and local news ratings. Furthermore, we believe operating the top ranked stations in our various markets allows us to attract and retain top talent.
 
We also believe that our local market leadership positions help us in negotiating more beneficial terms in our major network affiliation agreements, which currently expire at various dates through December 2024, and in our syndicated programming agreements. These leadership positions also give us additional leverage to negotiate retransmission contracts with cable system operators, telephone video distributors, direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) operators, and other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”).
 
We intend to maintain our market leadership position through continued prudent investment in our local news and syndicated programs, as well as continued technological advances and workflow improvements. We expect to continue to invest in technological upgrades in the future. We believe the foregoing will help us maintain and grow our market leadership, thereby enhancing our ability to grow and further diversify our revenues and cash flows.
 
Continue to Pursue Strategic Growth and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities. Over the last several years, the television broadcasting industry has been characterized by a high level of acquisition activity. We believe that there are a number of television stations, and a few station groups, that have attractive operating profiles and characteristics, and that share our commitment to local news coverage in the communities in which they operate and to creating high-quality and locally-driven content. On a highly selective basis, we may pursue opportunities for the acquisition of additional television stations or station groups that fit our strategic and operational objectives, and where we believe that we can improve revenue, efficiencies and cash flow through active management and cost controls. As we consider potential acquisitions, we primarily evaluate potential station audience and revenue shares and the extent to which the acquisition target would positively impact our existing station operations. Consistent with this strategy, we have completed several acquisition and divestiture transactions, including some that had a material impact on our results of operations. For more information on these transactions, see Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. This note also describes the stations we acquired in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, which we may also refer to collectively as our “acquisitions,” our “recent acquisitions” or “the acquisitions.”

    5 

  

Continue to Monetize Digital Spectrum. In addition to each station’s primary channel, we also broadcast a number of secondary channels. Certain secondary channels are simultaneously affiliated with more than one network. Our strategy includes expanding upon our digital offerings and sales. We continuously evaluate opportunities to use spectrum for future delivery of data to mobile devices using a new transmission standard.
Continue to Maintain Prudent Cost Management. Historically, we have closely managed costs to maintain and improve our margins. We believe that our market leadership position provides additional negotiating leverage that enables us to lower, on a relative basis, our syndicated programming costs. We have increased the efficiency of our stations by automating video production and back office processes. We believe that we will be able to further benefit from cost and operational efficiencies as we continue to grow.
Further Strengthen our Balance Sheet. During the last several years, we have leveraged our strong cash flow and efficient operating model to grow our diverse national footprint. In recent years, we acted to improve the terms of our debt by amending or replacing our long-term debt to secure favorable terms while interest rates are at historically low levels. During 2021, we completed the acquisition of all the equity interests of Meredith Corporation (“Meredith”) and of Quincy Media, Inc. (“Quincy”), and other transactions including divestitures resulting from the Meredith and Quincy acquisitions (collectively, the “2021 Acquisitions”) using a financing plan composed of our cash on hand, attractively priced fixed rate debt, proceeds from divestitures, and amended our Senior Credit Facility. During 2019, we completed the acquisition of all the equity interests of Raycom Media, Inc. (“Raycom”) and other related divestiture transactions (the “Raycom Merger”) using a financing plan composed of our cash on hand, common stock, preferred stock, attractively priced fixed rate debt and an amended term loan facility. We continually evaluate opportunities to improve our balance sheet. For more information regarding acquisition transactions, see Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.
Stations
 
Our television stations serve local communities across the country. From our largest market in Atlanta, Georgia (DMA 10) to our smallest in North Platte, Nebraska (DMA 209), we inform, educate, entertain and connect each of these communities to their state, the nation and the whole world. Each of our stations have a local studio, tower, sales, technical and administrative personnel dedicated to their community. Our network affiliations include the Big Four networks and more than a dozen specialized networks over their primary and secondary channels in nearly every market. Each station also provides these services through their local station website. For more information about our stations please visit our corporate website at www.gray.tv.
Cyclicality, Seasonality and Revenue Concentrations
 
Broadcast stations like ours rely on advertising revenue and are therefore sensitive to cyclical changes in the economy. Our political advertising revenue is generally not as significantly affected by economic slowdowns or recessions as non-political advertising revenue.
 
Broadcast advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters. This seasonality results partly from increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. Broadcast advertising revenue is also typically higher in even-numbered years due to spending by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups during the “on year” of the two-year election cycle. Political advertising spending is typically heaviest during the fourth quarter. In addition, the broadcast of the Olympic Games by our NBC-affiliated stations generally leads to increased viewership and revenue during those years.
 
    6 

  

Our broadcast advertising revenue is earned from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019, we derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 29%, 28% and 25% of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately 17%, 21% and 25%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Revenue from these industries may represent a higher percentage of total revenue in odd-numbered years due to, among other things, the increased availability of advertising time, as a result of such years being the “off year” of the two-year election cycle.
 
Station Network Affiliations. In addition to affiliations with ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX, our secondary channels are affiliated with numerous smaller networks and program services including, among others, the CW Network or the CW Plus Network (collectively, “CW”), MY Network, the MeTV Network, Justice, This TV Network, Antenna TV, Telemundo, Cozi, Heroes and Icons and MOVIES! Network. Certain of our secondary digital channels are affiliated with more than one network simultaneously. We also broadcast independent and local news/weather channels in some markets.
 
The Big Four networks dominate broadcast television in terms of the amount of viewership that their original programming attracts. The “Big Three” major broadcast networks of CBS, NBC and ABC provide their respective network affiliates with a majority of the programming broadcast each day. FOX and CW provide their affiliates with a smaller portion of each day’s programming compared to the Big Three networks. The CW Plus Network generally provides programming for the entire broadcast day for CW affiliates in markets smaller than the top 100 DMAs.
 
We believe most successful commercial television stations obtain their brand identity from locally produced news programs; however, the affiliation of a station’s channels with one of the Big Four major networks can have a significant impact on the station’s programming, revenues, expenses and operations. A typical network provides an affiliate with network programming in exchange for a substantial majority of the advertising time available for sale during the airing of the network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate sells the remaining advertising time available within the network programming and non-network programming, and the affiliate retains most or all of these revenues. In seeking to acquire programming to supplement network-supplied programming, which we believe is critical to maximizing affiliate revenue, affiliates compete primarily with other affiliates and independent stations in their markets and, in certain cases, various national non-broadcast networks (“cable networks”) and various video streaming services that present competitive programming. The Big Four networks and CW charge fees to their affiliates for receiving network programming.
 
A television station may also acquire programming through barter arrangements. Under a programming barter arrangement, a national program distributor retains a fixed amount of advertising time within the program in exchange for the programming it supplies. The television station may pay a fixed fee for such programming.
 
    7 

  

We record revenue and expense for trade transactions involving the exchange of tangible goods or services with our customers. The revenue is recorded at the time the advertisement is broadcast and the expense is recorded at the time the goods or services are used. The revenue and expense associated with these transactions are based on the fair value of the assets or services received.
 
Affiliates of FOX and CW must purchase or produce a greater amount of programming for their non-network time periods, generally resulting in higher programming costs. However, affiliates of FOX and CW retain a larger portion of their advertising time inventory and the related revenues compared to Big Three affiliates.
 
Competition 
 
Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Cable network programming is a significant competitor of broadcast television programming. No single cable network regularly attains audience levels comparable to any major broadcast network. Despite increasing competition from cable channels, streaming services, digital platforms, social media, and internet-delivered video channels, television broadcasting remains the dominant distribution system for mass-market television advertising. In addition, signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems materially affect a television station’s competitive position.
Audience. Stations compete for audience based on broadcast program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates. Networks supply a substantial portion of our affiliated stations’ daily programming. Affiliated stations depend on the performance of the network programs to attract viewers. There can be no assurance that any such current or future programming created by our affiliated networks will achieve or maintain satisfactory viewership levels. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of locally produced news, public affairs and entertainment programming, including national news or syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter only.
 
MVPD systems have significantly altered the competitive landscape for audience in the television industry. Specifically, MVPD systems can increase a broadcasting station’s competition for viewers in a market by providing both cable networks and distant television station signals not otherwise available to the station’s audience.
 
Other sources of competition for audiences, programming and advertisers include streaming services, connected televisions, internet websites, mobile applications and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems.
 
Recent developments by many companies, including internet streaming service providers and internet website operators, have expanded, and are continuing to expand, the variety and quality of broadcast and non-broadcast video programming available to consumers via the internet. Internet companies have developed business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming, network television and other content. As a result, additional programming has, and is expected to further become, available through non-traditional methods, which can directly impact the number of TV viewers, and thus indirectly impact station rankings, popularity and revenue possibilities of our stations.
 
Programming. Competition for non-network programming involves negotiating with national program distributors, or syndicators, that sell “first run” and “off network” or rerun programming packages. Each station competes against the other broadcast stations in its market for exclusive access to first run programming (such as Wheel of Fortune) and off network reruns (such as The Big Bang Theory). Broadcast stations also compete for exclusive news stories and features. Cable networks and internet service providers compete with local stations for programming.
 
    8 

  

Advertising. Advertising revenues comprise the primary source of revenues for our stations. Our stations compete for advertising revenues in their respective markets with other television stations, digital platforms including Google and Facebook, local cable and other MVPD systems, as well as local newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories and direct mail.
Federal Regulation of the Television Broadcast Industry
 
General. Under the Communications Act of 1934 (“Communications Act”), television broadcast operations such as ours are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC. Among other things, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to: (i) issue, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; (ii) regulate stations’ operations and equipment; and (iii) impose penalties for violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of a licensee without prior FCC approval.
License Grant and Renewal. The FCC grants broadcast licenses to television stations for terms of up to eight years. Broadcast licenses are of paramount importance to the operations of television stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a licensee’s broadcast license if the FCC finds that: (i) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations; and (iii) there have been no other violations which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. Historically the FCC has renewed broadcast licenses in substantially all cases. While we are not currently aware of any facts or circumstances that might prevent the renewal of our stations’ licenses at the end of their respective license terms, we cannot provide any assurances that any license will be renewed. Failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended pending the FCC’s processing of a renewal application. For further information regarding the expiration dates of our stations’ current licenses and renewal application status, see the table under the heading “Stations”.
Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings. The FCC’s broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast properties that we may hold or acquire. As part of its requirement to review its media ownership rules every four years, in late 2017 the FCC adopted significant changes to its ownership rules, which took effect in February 2018. The updated rules were temporarily vacated by a lower appeals court in 2019, but ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States and reinstated by the FCC in June 2021. The FCC’s current ownership rules generally prohibit an entity from owning or having “attributable” interests in two television stations in the same market if both are ranked among the top-four stations in the market. The FCC will consider waiver requests on a case-by-case basis. The rules also limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations that may be under common ownership, operation and control, or in which a single person or entity may hold an official position or have more than a specified interest or percentage of voting power. The FCC’s rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits, and thus also apply to our principals and certain investors.
 
The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. In December 2018, the FCC began a new quadrennial review of its ownership rules with the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) seeking comments on competition in the local television marketplace, including: (i) whether its current two-stations to a market limit should be relaxed or tightened; (ii) whether it should modify its general prohibition on owning two stations ranked among the top-four in a market; (iii) if the FCC’s television market analysis should consider the factors the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) applies to local television issues; and (iv) how the FCC should evaluate competition among television stations. Comments and reply comments in the 2018 quadrennial review were filed in the second quarter of 2019. On June 4, 2021, the FCC issued a public notice soliciting further comment to update the record in the 2018 quadrennial review. Comments and reply comments in response to this public notice were filed in September and October 2021.
 
    9 

  

Local TV Ownership Rules. The FCC’s current television ownership rules allow one entity to own two commercial television stations in a DMA as long as no more than one station is ranked among the top-four stations in the market. Waivers of this rule will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
National Television Station Ownership Rule. The maximum percentage of US households that a single owner can reach through commonly owned television stations is 39 percent. This limit was specified by Congress in 2004. The FCC applies a 50 percent “discount” for ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) stations. In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF discount. Comments and reply comments were filed in 2018, and the proceeding remains open.
Conclusion. The FCC’s media ownership proceedings are on-going and, in many cases, are or will be subject to further judicial and potentially Congressional review. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these current or potential proceedings.
Attribution Rules. Under the FCC’s ownership rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of certain types of our securities could violate FCC regulations if that purchaser owned or acquired an “attributable” interest in another television broadcast station in the same area as one or more of our stations. Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of media ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station’s total weekly programming or is a same-market television broadcast company; and (vi) time brokerage of a television broadcast station by a same-market television broadcast company providing more than 15 percent of the station’s weekly programming.
 
Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC’s current rules and policies. However, the FCC previously requested comment on whether local news service agreements and/or shared services agreements should be considered attributable for purposes of applying the media ownership rules. The DOJ has taken steps under the antitrust laws to block certain transactions involving joint sales or other services agreements.
 
To our knowledge, no officer, director or five percent or greater shareholder currently holds an attributable interest in another television station that is inconsistent with the FCC’s ownership rules and policies or with our ownership of our stations.
 
Alien Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act restricts the ability of foreign entities or individuals to own or hold interests in broadcast licenses. The Communications Act bars the following from holding broadcast licenses: foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments, non-citizens, representatives of non-citizens, and corporations or partnerships organized under the laws of a foreign nation. Foreign individuals or entities, collectively, may directly or indirectly own or vote no more than 20 percent of the capital stock of a licensee or 25 percent of the capital stock of a corporation that directly or indirectly controls a licensee. The 20 percent limit on foreign ownership of a licensee may not be waived. In September 2016, the Commission adopted an Order that allows broadcast licensees to use streamlined procedures when filing a petition for declaratory ruling seeking FCC approval to exceed the 25 percent foreign ownership benchmark for a parent company. The Commission also clarified the methodology for publicly traded broadcasters to assess compliance with the foreign ownership limits.
 
    10 

  

We serve as a holding company for our subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that hold station licenses. Therefore, absent a grant of a declaratory ruling, we may be restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-citizens, foreign governments, representatives of non-citizens or foreign governments, or foreign corporations.
 
Programming and Operations. Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations.
 
The Children’s Television Act of 1990 limits commercial matter in children’s television programs and requires stations to present educational and informational children’s programming. Broadcasters are effectively required through license renewal processing guidelines to provide a certain amount of children’s educational programming per week on their primary channels. In July 2019, the FCC issued an Order that adopted sweeping changes to the current children’s programming rules giving broadcasters increased flexibility in how they choose to serve the educational and informational needs of children.
 
Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is more than $400,000 per incident. The FCC has sought comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies, but has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding. The outcome of this proceeding could affect future FCC policies in this area, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
EEO Rules. The FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast station licensees. Broadcasters are subject to random audits to ensure compliance with EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance.
 
MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals. Under the Communications Act and FCC regulations, each television station generally has a so-called “must-carry” right to carriage of its primary channels on all MVPD systems serving its market. Each commercial television station may elect between invoking its “must carry” right or invoking a right to prevent an MVPD system from retransmitting the station’s signal without its consent (“retransmission consent”). Stations must make this election by October 1 every three years. Such elections are binding throughout the three-year cycle that commences on the subsequent January 1. The current election cycle commenced on January 1, 2021 and ends on December 31, 2023. During this period, our stations elected retransmission consent and have entered into retransmission consent contracts with virtually all MVPD systems serving their markets.
 
In accordance with STELAR, the FCC has promulgated rules that: (i) grant DBS providers the right to seek market modifications based on factors similar to those used in the cable industry; (ii) broaden the FCC’s prohibition against joint retransmission negotiations by prohibiting joint retransmission negotiations by any stations in the same DMA not under common control; (iii) prohibit a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminate the “sweeps prohibition,” which precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods.
 
We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or that grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restriction on joint negotiation might impact future opportunities.
 
    11 

  

The FCC has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. In March 2020, the FCC sought comment on whether it should modernize its methodology for determining whether a television station is significantly viewed in a community outside of its local television market. Under exceptions to the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, cable operators and satellite carriers are not required to delete the duplicating network or syndicated programming where the signal of the otherwise distant station is determined to be significantly viewed in the relevant community. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.
 
Certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without the consent of the copyright owner of the programming. The majority of federal courts have sided with broadcasters and enjoined OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Recently, a new OVD, Locast, organized as a non-profit, began offering free access to broadcast programming in select cities over the Internet. This OVD argued that its retransmission of broadcast signals via the internet is covered by an exemption from copyright liability applicable to non-profit entities. In July 2019, the major broadcast networks and certain affiliated entities filed a copyright suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging this OVD’s operations. In August 2021, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that Locast was not covered by the copyright provision and was violating the copyright laws. Locast subsequently entered into an agreement to pay damages to settle the copyright claims and shut down its service.
 
On December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on its proposal to modernize the term “MVPD” to be technology neutral. If the NPRM proposal is adopted, an entity that uses the internet to distribute multiple streams of linear programming would be considered an MVPD and would have the same retransmission consent rights and obligations as other MVPDs, including the right to negotiate with television stations to carry their broadcast signals. The FCC also asked about the possible copyright implications of this proposal. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC’s interpretive proceedings.
 
In December 2019, the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the “TVPA of 2019”) were signed into law. Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that (i) allows MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) requires large stations groups, such as us, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. The rules that the FCC promulgated to implement those provisions of the TVPA of 2019 became effective in July 2020.
 
The foregoing does not purport to be a complete summary of the Communications Act, other applicable statutes, or the FCC’s rules, regulations or policies. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before, are being considered by, and may in the future be considered by, Congress and federal regulatory agencies from time to time. We cannot predict the effect of any existing or proposed federal legislation, regulations or policies on our business. Also, several of the foregoing matters are now, or may become, the subject of litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or the effect on our business.

Human Capital
 
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key employees and members of our management team.
