Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
Cantaloupe, Inc., previously known as USA Technologies, Inc., is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are a digital payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the unattended retail market. We are transforming the unattended retail world by offering a single platform for self-service commerce which includes integrated payments processing and software solutions that handle inventory management, pre-kitting, route logistics, warehouse and back-office management. Our enterprise-wide platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers ranging from vending machine companies to operators of micro-markets, car wash, electric vehicle charging stations, commercial laundry, kiosks, amusements and more, can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively.
We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription and transaction fees resulting from transactions on, as well as connectivity and telemetry services provided by, our ePort® cashless devices, Seed™ software, and our Quick Connect API services. These services include digital payment processing, loyalty programs, inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, and intelligent merchandising. Devices operating on the Company’s platform and using our services include those resulting from the sale, finance or a monthly bundled subscription (Cantaloupe ONE program) of our point of sale ("POS") electronic payment devices, telemetry devices or certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals or telemetry devices. The majority of ePort customers pay a monthly service fee plus a blended percentage rate on transaction volumes. Transaction fees on volumes processed through the Company’s payment devices, are the most significant driver of the Company’s revenues.
Our customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate primarily in self-serve retail markets including food and beverage vending, micro-markets, amusement and arcade machines, commercial laundry, air/vacuum, car wash, electric vehicle, and various other self-serve kiosk applications as well as equipment developers or manufacturers who incorporate our hardware, software, and services into their product offerings.
THE INDUSTRY
We offer a variety of solutions in unattended retail, which enable the acceptance of digital payments and allow our customers to simplify inventory, analytics, warehouse, logistics, and back-office management. We believe the following industry trends are 
5


driving growth in demand for digital payment systems and advanced logistics management in general and more specifically within the markets we serve:
•Increased adoption of cashier-less models via vending machines or self-service kiosks to meet demand for and more use of fast, simple and seamless digital purchase and payment experiences;
•Rising consumer demand for transaction convenience, safety, and security which we have seen in the growth in digital payment adoption, especially contactless payments, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
•Ongoing labor challenges drive increased utility of actionable operational business intelligence from new technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive operational efficiencies and operational transparency through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.
Shift Toward Digital Payments Is Here to Stay.
One lasting impact of COVID-19 was the creation of a ‘new normal’ for businesses and shoppers alike, accelerating the secular shift to self-service commerce. According to “The Visa Back to Business Global Study: 2022 Small Business Outlook” (the "Visa Study"); 73% of small businesses surveyed said that new forms of digital payments are fundamental to their growth. In addition, according to the Visa Study, 41% of consumers surveyed said they either plan to shift to using only digital payments within the next two years, or are already cashless. Lastly, 82% of small businesses surveyed said they will accept digital options in 2022 and nearly half (46%) of consumers surveyed expect to use digital payments more often in 2022, with just 4% saying they will use them less. The acceleration towards digital payments amongst surveyed consumers was primarily driven by benefits such as easier online shopping, personal safety and convenience.
Increasing Consumer Interest in Self-Service Models
Cashier-less stores that minimize or remove human intervention have shifted consumer expectations on retail shopping experiences. A consumer survey of 2,000 people across the United States performed by the Company and CITE Research in 2021 found that 83% of consumers who increased unattended retail usage during the pandemic expect to continue using it at elevated levels when the pandemic was over. And consumers are not just looking for traditional food and beverage offerings through unattended, as 82% of respondents cited an interest in purchasing nontraditional items through vending machines, with the interest significantly increasing since the last survey in 2019. Clothing and health and beauty products had the greatest two-year increase with 70% - 71% of respondents interested in purchasing these items from vending machines in 2021 compared to 55% for clothing and 64% for health and beauty in 2019 respectively.

COMPETITION
The unattended retail industry is highly competitive with service providers ranging from well-established enterprises to early stage companies within the financial technology and software services industries. The markets for Cantaloupe’s products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. Many of the company’s competitors are challenging Cantaloupe’s industry leading position, particularly when it comes to pricing, emulating products, services, and marketing, as well as addressing consumer trends. However, we believe we have competitive strengths that position us favorably. 
Consumers are expecting more from their shopping experience, with access to buy what they want, when they want, with the ability to pay with any shape or form of digital currency. This has led to a multitude of new devices on the market to enable a more engaging experience at the POS. In addition, micro markets are becoming one of the largest growth sectors in the convenience services industry, with large competitors owning a majority of the current market share. While we believe we have a strong competitive offering that positions us favorably in software services for unattended retail, competitors are entering the market with modernized back-end systems that are focused on the user interface along with real-life product planogram possibilities.

MARKETS WE SERVE
While the below key verticals represent only a fraction of our total market potential, as described below, these are the areas where we have gained the most traction to date. 

Vending. According to the 2020 Census of the Convenience Services Industry (conducted biannually), a study conducted by the NAMA Foundation and research firm Technomic, the US Convenience Services Industry, which consists of vending machines, micro markets, OCS and pantry services, represented total annual revenues of approximately $16 billion in 2020 compared to total annual revenues of approximately $27 billion in 2019, reflecting a reduction of approximately $11 billion and 40%. This was due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Convenience Services Industry is expected to be 64% larger in 2022 compared to 2020, and operators expect a full recovery to 2019 industry levels (pre-pandemic levels) by 2022-2023. In 2020, 80% of the Convenience Services Industry's total annual revenues came from the Vending vertical while Micro Markets, OCS and Pantry Services verticals represented approximately 12%, 7% and 1% of total annual revenues respectively. 
Micro Markets and Kiosks. According to the Automatic Merchandiser’s State of the Industry Annual Report published in July 2022, the vending and micro market business operators surveyed indicated that the number of micro market locations served increased 70% in 2021. This demonstrates that while COVID-19 impacted growth and new location placements in 2020, micro markets continued to experience a significant level of growth coming out of the pandemic. We believe the desire to diversify product offerings to employees, while giving them their own convenience store with a micro market, will continue to increase. Our primary opportunity in the micro markets vertical is providing a fully integrated solution to our customers which includes a point-of-sale platform and leveraging the Seed Markets offering to optimize our customers payments and logistics services including integrated route scheduling, warehouse pre-picking, and reporting. While micro markets continue to grow in the traditional vending and food service industry, self-service kiosks are also on the rise. According to the 2022 Kiosk Marketplace Census Report, the 2021 Zebra Technologies’ Global Shopper Study found that nearly half (47%) of shoppers used retail self-checkouts, a 7% year-on-year increase, and 91% of these said they will continue using the technology. 
Vehicle Services. Our primary opportunities in the vehicle services markets relate to businesses that provide air, vacuum, car wash, electric car charging and parking services. In these sectors we can provide customers with cashless payment terminals, payment processing, telemetry services for data and connectivity services, as well as software solutions to improve business 
9


optimization. Currently, we partner with a leader in the air vending services by equipping their machines with our cashless acceptance devices. 
Amusement and Entertainment. Our current customers and primary opportunities in the amusement and entertainment markets are typically classified as “street/route business,” which are standalone businesses that are open to the general public and that offer card/coin-operated games such as claw machines, amusement park machines (i.e. body dryers), bowling alleys and bar entertainment (e.g. digital music machines and dart machines). Currently, we partner with one of the largest independent claw machine providers to enable them with cashless acceptance devices and payment processing. 
Laundry. Our primary opportunities in laundry consist of the coin-operated commercial laundry and multi-housing laundry markets. Currently, our joint solution with an industry leader competes with hardware manufacturers, who provide joint solutions to their customers in partnership with payment processors, and with at least one competitor who provides an integrated hardware and payment processing solution.
OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our primary objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of technology that enables electronic payment transactions, advanced logistics management, and value-added services primarily at small-ticket, self-service retail locations such as vending, kiosks, electric vehicle charging. commercial laundry, and other similar markets. We plan to execute our growth strategy organically and through strategic acquisitions. Key elements of our strategy are to:
Maximize Growth in Existing Customers/Partners. Our current customers have seen the benefits of our products and services and we believe they continue to represent the largest opportunity to scale recurring revenue and connections, through the addition of new products and services, as well as expanding our footprint of current product offerings. We are continuously enhancing our solutions and services with additional features and functionality that create add-on service offerings to existing customers such as RPC, HIVERY Enhance integration and Yoke POS. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of Cantaloupe’s solutions and services in the unattended POS payments market.
Capitalize on the Emerging Contactless, EMV, NFC, and Growing Mobile Payments Trends. With more than 90% of our digital connected base enabled to accept NFC payments (including mobile wallets), we believe that continued consumer preference towards contactless payments, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay, represent a significant opportunity for the Company to further drive adoption in the current markets as well as new unattended kiosk applications in which we can provide services and solutions. Through innovation we’ll seek to offer consumers more ways to pay leveraging digital wallets such as pay with crypto, or other digital-like applications. 
Expand into Micro Markets. With the Company’s Yoke’s POS platform, we will continue to penetrate into the growing vertical of micro markets both in near-vending channels as well as small business retail. Self-service or self-checkout is on the rise and with our seamlessly integrated offering or standalone solution of Yoke POS, we believe we are positioned well to deliver a scalable micro market solution for businesses of all kinds. We plan to differentiate ourselves by providing a single platform to manage consumer and operational aspects of micro markets, while also integrating multiple service providers for flexibility and ultimate ease to our customers. 
Further Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We plan to continue to introduce our turn-key solutions and services to various adjacent markets such as the small business retail market to enable self-checkout solutions, along with other key growth verticals like electric car charging where we’ll leverage our expertise in digital payment solutions and telemetry services for data and asset management services. We plan to leverage the Seed platform to extend route optimization tools into other verticals where static schedules are not optimal for service visits. In addition, Seed Pro’s patented dynamic route scheduling capabilities can support optimal servicing and decreased operational costs. 
Capitalize on Opportunities in International Markets. We are currently focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets for our ePort devices, Yoke POS terminals, and the Seed platform, but will seek to establish a presence in unattended retail markets to provide electronic payments and logistics optimization outside of the U.S. and Canada. In order to do so, we have dedicated sales resources to spearhead international opportunities, starting with Latin America, and Europe. 
Comprehensive Service and Support. In addition to its industry-leading ePort digital payments system, Yoke POS terminal, Seed logistics software, the Company seeks to provide its customers with a comprehensive platform designed to encourage optimal return on investment through business planning and performance optimization; acceptance of crypto payments, and a 
10


loyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend digital payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operator’s business including the micro-markets contract food industry, online and mobile payments.
SALES AND MARKETING
Our sales strategy includes both direct sales and channel development, depending on the particular dynamics of each of our markets. Our direct sale efforts are supported by both inside and external sales team members, which are aligned to serve our enterprise and our small- and medium-business (SMB) customers and prospects.

Our marketing strategy includes advertising and outreach initiatives designed to build brand awareness, position our company’s thought leadership within unattended retail, make clear our competitive strengths, and prove the value of our products and services to our opportunity markets. Activities include creating a vibrant company and product presence on the web, digital advertising, Search Engine Optimization ("SEO"), and social media; the use of direct mail and email campaigns; educational and instructional online training sessions; content curation through blogs, whitepapers, guides, podcasts, and joint industry studies; advertising in vertically-oriented trade publications; participating in industry tradeshows and events; and working closely with customers and key strategic partners on co-marketing opportunities that drive customer and consumer adoption of our services.
As of June 30, 2022, we are marketing and selling our products primarily through our full and part-time sales and marketing staff consisting of 44 people.
IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS
Our most important relationships are with our almost 24,000 customers, which are governed by services agreements that provide for terms and conditions of purchase, rental, subscription or lease of the devices, licensing of our solutions, and processing services. Under the terms, we typically collect our fees from settled funds, including activation fees, monthly service fees, and transaction processing fees. Our relationships with certain large customers are governed by customized terms and conditions contained within individually negotiated services agreements.
