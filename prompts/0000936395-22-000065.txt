Industry Background
Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements
The market in which we sell is dynamic and characterized by a high rate of change. Optical networks – which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables – have experienced strong traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by enterprise and consumer end users, as well as cloud-based services and applications:
•Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models – including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources. In addition, content is increasingly moving to the network edge, creating new capacity and traffic demands closer to the user.

•Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.
•Mobile Traffic and Applications. Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the continued proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites.
•Residential Access Applications and Enterprise Applications. In recent years there has been a shift in bandwidth demands, traffic patterns and computing functions to the edge of networks. This trend has been meaningfully accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to an increase in remote and hybrid working, distance learning, and work from home arrangements. With a higher percentage of data flows concentrating closer to the network edge, more capacity and higher bandwidth to home and enterprise locations is required. These shifts could be permanent, and could influence network architectures and require network operators to adapt.
Emerging technologies, services and applications are further impacting or expected to impact network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. These include:
•5G. Fifth-generation wireless broadband (“5G”) technology is enabling meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance, and enabling emerging applications and services that 4G/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures, including through the addition of additional cell sites as part of the network densification efforts that are paving the way for 5G implementation. 
•Fiber-Based Access Networks. Network densification initiatives by cable and multiservice operators seek to push more digital fiber closer to the end user in an effort to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while decreasing power, space and operating costs. Wireline service providers are responding to similar service and end customer demands by extending fiber to the home and deeper into access networks.
•Internet of Things (“IoT”). As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic (“M2M”) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications.
•Immersive Technologies and Ultra-High Definition Video (“UHD”). Immersive technologies like virtual reality (“VR”), augmented reality (“AR”), interactive experiences, gaming and 360° video, as well as UHD (4K and 8K) video, are likely to place further capacity demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics and other technology companies are rapidly advancing these applications,which require high bandwidth and low latency, and making the associated devices more widely available and affordable to consumers.
•Edge Computing. To provide end user’s with the required experience for a growing set of immersive cloud services, network operators have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, the number and capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users. These changes at the edge of networks may affect network topologies, demands and traffic patterns.
•Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). By increasing network intelligence and improving automation, ML and AI can enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. Adoption of these technologies is expected to continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, and ML and AI will serve as drivers of further network traffic and solutions innovation.
We believe that increased adoption of these technologies, services, and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures, requiring network operators to invest in their metro, access and aggregation networks, as well as their core networks.
Demand for More Programmable and Automated Networks
To create a more digital experience for their end users, reduce operational costs and introduce more service agility, network operators are investing in next-generation infrastructures that combine end-to-end service automation with the deployment of highly programmable infrastructures. We expect network operators will continue to pursue strategies that emphasize one or more of the following:
•Closed Loop Automation. Network operators are seeking to reduce network operating costs and better leverage analytics and control capabilities to automate end-to-end service creation and operation. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the programmable network infrastructure and software control elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability to determine the best placement of traffic or network functions to deliver optimal service quality and resource utilization. 
•Software-Defined Networking (“SDN”). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation and quickly deliver services to end users. SDN enables individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, and the optimization of traffic paths and the control of data flows through a network.
•Network Function Virtualization (“NFV”). NFV is the separation of network services or capabilities from the physical network assets that traditionally provide these services or capabilities to end users. To accelerate the introduction of new services, network operators are increasingly using solutions like NFV, which enables network functions that traditionally would have run on specialized or dedicated hardware to be provided through software that runs on industry-standard servers and network and storage platforms. 
We believe that adoption of these strategies, and the related evolution of core, metro, aggregation and access network infrastructures, will require network operators and their network solutions vendors to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of both physical and virtual network resources, optimized through software. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will require an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among networking solutions vendors.
Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions
Network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or “consumption models,” in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to purchasing fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor, new consumption models include the procurement or use of: 
•a fully integrated infrastructure solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator’s own software or that of another vendor; 
•integrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or “disaggregated” procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; 
•open source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions;
•open IP network operating systems running on off-the-shelf third-party equipment; and
•system integration services or customer self-integration to reconstitute the disaggregated components.
Some network operators, including certain of our largest customers, have adopted or are pursuing development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as “white box” hardware). This commoditized hardware could be used with in-house developed data path and 
control software or third-party developed network operating software. Further, some network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, that can be housed in a switch or router platform, or used in place of a modem in a traditional optical system. 
The consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. While the adoption of these approaches has been limited to date, we expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing a premium on a vendor’s ability to provide robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.
Supply Chain Constraints
In the face of extraordinary demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits and other electronic components, has experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent periods. These conditions are impacting a wide range of industries and, across the networking industry, participants are experiencing component shortages, extended lead times, increased costs, and unexpected cancellation or delay of previously committed supply. We believe these supply chain challenges and their adverse impact on our industry will continue at least through fiscal 2023 and expect that the extended lead times and elevated supply chain costs experienced by our industry will persist for the reasonably foreseeable future. It is unclear when the supply environment will become less volatile and what impacts the supply environment will have on the industry in future periods.
Product Development and Sustainability
As network traffic and service expansion continue to grow, network operators are looking toward technology innovation as a means to help support their business models and prepare for a low carbon future. Network operators are increasingly looking to their technology vendor partners to help them manage the environmental impact of their networks, including energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and equipment refurbishment and recycling. For innovation leaders capable of advancing a development strategy and product roadmap that addresses the network performance and sustainability outcomes sought by network operators, a market transition to a low carbon future and the ability to offer greener technology offerings present meaningful opportunities for enhanced competitive position and business growth. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversification and global scale to drive the profitable growth of our business. Key elements of this strategy include:
Extend Innovation Leadership in Core and Optical Networking. We are focused on using our significant research and development investment capacity to push the pace of innovation in our traditional markets and provide leading offerings that leverage our Adaptive Network vision to make our customers’ networks more dynamic through further advances in programmable network platforms, analytics, control and automation. To strengthen our optical leadership, during fiscal 2022, we acquired Xelic, Inc. (“Xelic”), a provider and developer of field-programmable gate array (“FPGA”) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology and optical networking IP cores. We also continue to innovate, increase the performance of, and enhance the capabilities for our leading WaveLogic® coherent modem technology in multiple form factors. To support our enhanced portfolio and solutions offerings, we intend to grow our attached services business and leverage network transformation with a broader service offering that includes network migration, optimization and multi-vendor network integration.
Invest in Next Generation Metro and Edge Networking Solutions. To expand our addressable markets and capture additional opportunities in metro and edge applications, we are making significant investments in our Routing and Switching solutions. We are leveraging our optical expertise to offer new architectural approaches to address Metro and Edge network use cases. Among other things, in fiscal 2022, we launched our Residential Broadband Coherent Routing solutions, and we are developing Routing and Switching solutions with enhanced IP/Ethernet capabilities, including packet routing, aggregation and switching, 5G cross-haul, fiber-based passive optical network (“PON”) access, and edge computing. To advance our strategy and transform the network edge, including in 5G networks and cloud environments, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we acquired from AT&T its Vyatta virtual routing and switching technology (“Vyatta”). During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we also acquired Benu Networks, Inc. (“Benu”) and its portfolio of cloud-native software solutions, including a virtual Broadband Network Gateway (“(v)BNG”), which complements and extends our existing portfolio of broadband access solutions. During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tibit Communications, Inc., a provider of passive optical network solutions.
Embrace Multiple Consumption Models and Promote Choice. We are offering a range of networking solutions across different consumption models to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to promote choice in our markets. We have made our coherent technology available in both integrated systems and pluggable form factors that together address a range of technical and economic requirements of network operators. We are pursuing sales opportunities that leverage our WaveLogic technology in the form of high-performance transceivers/modems – the combination of a Ciena-designed optical chipset and ASIC with other key optical components that is sold independently of integrated systems. By addressing multiple consumption models, we seek to secure a larger portion of the world’s optical network wavelengths, expand our addressable market and access new customer verticals and applications. 
Promote Enhanced Software Automation. To support our customers business needs for rapid service introduction and optimized network operation, we seek to improve network layer automation and programmability by advancing our multi-layer domain controller - MCP software and applications. We are also focused on gaining adoption and expanding application for our Adaptive IP software, leveraging our Service-Aware Operating System (“SAOS”) embedded in our Routing and Switching products. We also seek to promote broader adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, highlighting its ability to automate the service management lifecycle. In so doing, we believe that Blue Planet can help customers with their digital transformations by transitioning legacy networks into “service ready” networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and management of new services. A key part of our strategy is to grow our software business as a portion of our total business through expanded customer adoption and broader applications, and to gain adoption of recurring and subscription-based models. 
Focus Diversification on High-Growth Applications and Customer Segments. We believe that the continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, continue to grow our business, and better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. We seek to continue diversifying our solutions offerings, customer base and geographic reach to address fast-growing applications and markets, including those that are adjacent to or complementary with our current addressable market. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with existing customers and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors, particularly in international markets.

Our Global Customer Engagement organization includes a direct sales presence that is organized geographically around the following markets: (i) the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (“Americas”); (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (iii) Asia Pacific, Japan and India (“APAC”). Within each geographic area, we maintain specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical, or portfolio. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as partner resources, field marketing, services professionals and commercial management personnel, who ensure that we maintain a high-touch, consultative relationship with our customers.
We also maintain a global partner program that includes distributors, resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other third-party distributors who market and sell our products and services. We utilize these third-party channel partners to market and sell our solutions into specific geographies, applications or customer verticals. We believe there are opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand our addressable market, while at the same time reducing the financial and operational risk of entering additional markets. For third parties in our Ciena Partner Network, we maintain a code of conduct that is available on our website and that sets forth our expectations for the high standards of ethical and legally compliant conduct we require of them in supporting our business. 
To support our global customer engagement efforts, we invest in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners.
Operations and Supply Chain Management
Our operations personnel manage the relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.
We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower labor cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk, changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries, and physical risk, including the impact of climate change in such geographies. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers’ activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our supply chain and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not represent long-term commitments. However, in the face of supply chain challenges experienced in recent periods, including extended lead times, we have placed advance commitments for inventory to mitigate the impact of these supply constraints on our and our customers’ businesses. 
We currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.
We continue to focus on a range of initiatives that seek to optimize our operations, improve our resiliency, and drive cost reductions. We seek to balance these goals through our sourcing and supply chain strategy, outsourcing and use of lower cost geographies. Our efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.
We actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our own business and those within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards that aim to ensure working conditions in the electronics industry, or industries in which electronics are a key component, and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to agree to adhere to these same standards. We also 
publish a Sustainability Report and maintain a Human Rights Policy applicable to suppliers, each of which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices.
For a discussion of actions taken to manage through the ongoing global supply chain constraints, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Overview - Supply Chain Constraints” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Seasonality
Like other companies in our industry, we have historically experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We have typically experienced reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has typically resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations. In fact, the effects of the dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods, together with our increased backlog, may impact the traditional seasonality in our business. For a more detailed discussion of the current supply and demand environment and our backlog, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Overview” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Competition
Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Nokia, Huawei (as defined below), Cisco, Juniper Networks and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA, Ribbon Communications, Calix, and Adtran. We also compete with a number of companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment or geographic market.
Keeping pace with the market’s demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon component and module technology developed by and procured from third-party providers, including NTT Electronics, Marvell Technology Group and Cisco. We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors or an alternative consumption model such as “white box” technology, or directly in module, pluggable and component sales opportunities.
As we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and traditional IT services vendors. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, Netcracker and Ericsson.
Across our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:
•functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;
•the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;
•price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions; 
•incumbency and strength of existing business relationships;
•technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development;
•time-to-market in delivering products and features;
•company stability and financial health;
•ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;
•flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management; 
•ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;
•operating costs, space requirements and power consumption of network solutions;
•software and network automation capabilities; 
•ability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability; 
•services and support capabilities;
•security of enterprise, product development, support processes, and products; and
•ability to offer solutions that help customers meet their business needs while achieving their climate sustainability goals.
Our competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by international trade and related matters, in particular between the U.S. and China. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”) and certain affiliates to the “Entity List,” resulting in significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign direct product rule under the EAR in a manner that significantly expanded its application to Huawei. Separately, the U.S. has taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions have resulted in escalating tensions between the U.S. and China and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. 
We also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as “white box” hardware, particularly where a customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
The success of our business and technology leadership depends significantly on our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2022, we had approximately 2,100 issued patents and more than 580 pending patent applications worldwide.
Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent, or minimize the risks of all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. 
Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.
Environment and Sustainability 
Our innovation efforts and our environmental sustainability initiatives are closely linked. Our products and product development efforts are designed to offer significant improvements in footprint and power savings, in order to help enable more efficient and sustainable networks for our customers. We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design, and to manage the life cycle impact of our products, including packaging and distribution, support, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We voluntarily provide on an annual basis CDP climate change and water disclosures and 
are a member of the RBA. We have adopted, and seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt, the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. 
People and Culture
Our technology solutions are developed, marketed, sold and supported by the talented individuals that make up our global workforce of our 8,079 persons as of October 29, 2022, over 98% of whom were full-time employees. We have a broad base of talent in more than 35 countries, with approximately 57% in the Americas, 35% in APAC, and 8% in EMEA, the majority of whom are in engineering, operations or sales roles.
We understand that our industry and innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and adopting progressive human capital management practices constitute a core element of our corporate strategy.
Our Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy, which includes management’s design and execution of our “people strategy.” This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to execute on our business plans, and that we have programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are well aligned and support these goals.Through our “People Promise,” we promote a workplace environment where our employees are empowered, feel included and have an opportunity to make a difference through their work at Ciena. In doing so, we seek to cultivate for employees a culture of vibrancy, belonging and happiness, while enabling us to be an attractive employer of choice within our markets. Our executive team is actively involved in and sponsors key initiatives and employee resource groups intended to promote this corporate culture. To that end, our people strategy is focused on the following:
•Promote Belonging through Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity through recruiting outreach, internal networking and resource groups, inclusivity networks, and mentoring programs. As of October 29, 2022, our global workforce was approximately 21.6% female. Our Board of Directors is 30% female and 20% ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2021, in the U.S., where we are headquartered, our 1,760 employee workforce approximately reflected the following ethnicities: 65.5% White, 21.3% Asian, 5.8% Hispanic or Latino, 4.7% Black or African American, 2.1% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.6% additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). We are committed to increasing diversity in our workforce at all levels, and regularly monitor our recruitment process to improve the diversity of our workforce and candidate pool. Our commitment to providing an inclusive workplace is demonstrated through the introduction of a corporate objective for fiscal 2022 to have 80% of our global workforce participate in our Conscious Inclusion Workshops, which we exceeded by achieving 90% participation as of the end of fiscal 2022. In addition, we support multiple active internal networking and resource groups, including our Women@Ciena group, Black & African Heritage group, LatinX group, Pride@Ciena LGBT+ group, and our Next@Ciena early in career group. In fiscal 2022, we also launched Vets at Ciena, our veterans’ employee resource group. In fiscal 2022, we continued to run a targeted development program aimed at strengthening underrepresented individuals’ sense of belonging and enhancing communication, confidence, self-awareness and financial acumen. We also maintain a global Inclusivity Council, which is led by two of our executives and aims to address actions for inclusion, and we have signed The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. 
•Support Employee Wellbeing and Engagement. We prioritize supporting the overall wellbeing of our employees and their eligible dependents. We provide a broad and diverse suite of offerings that focus on physical, mental and emotional, financial and social wellbeing and, during fiscal 2022, we expanded our offerings to include a focus on key life events such as aging and retirement readiness. Our wellbeing programs are deployed through a variety of means including expense reimbursement benefits, wellbeing challenges and rewards, 24x7 crisis support, employee assistance resources, mental health coaching, and a library of resources accessible to participants digitally and through hosted webinars. We regularly seek input from employees through employee engagement and pulse surveys on specific issues that are intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment that supports our People Promise and measures our culture of compliance. Our fiscal 2022 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of approximately 77% and resulted in engagement scores across all indexes that met or exceeded industry benchmarks. Our global wellbeing program also includes a long-standing practice of remote and flexible working arrangements and flexible paid time off in many of our geographies.
•Offer Competitive Compensation and Ensure Pay Equity. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive, fair and transparent compensation and progressive benefits offerings. We conduct an annual pay fairness assessment of 
gender globally and of ethnicity in the U.S. and take action to ensure we are paying individuals performing similar work equitably. We deployed Syndio’s workplace equity platform beginning in fiscal 2020 to fine-tune our methodology and enable regular global pay fairness assessments. To align performance and stockholder interest, we base our annual incentive compensation on both business and individual performance, we maintain an employee stock purchase plan and we have broadly expanded employee participation in equity compensation in recent years. We also offer competitive family leave, including global family leave to support employees throughout various life stages, carer’s leave, bereavement leave, parental leave that includes a minimum of 18 weeks paid time off for new mothers (including eight weeks recovery and ten weeks bonding) and ten weeks paid time off for new fathers and adoptive parents, and financial assistance for adoptive parents, and recently expanded flexible paid time-off to more than 98% of our workforce globally. We offer meaningful retirement benefits and programming to promote retirement readiness among our employee base. In recent years, we have enhanced employer contributions to our North America retirement plans, added our first ESG fund option for employees and, as of October 29, 2022, achieved greater than 99% participation of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada in our defined contribution retirement plans.
•Provide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including peer and management-initiated awards to recognize employees who best exemplify our core values, patent incentive and distinguished engineer awards, and awards recognizing employees who exemplify our commitment to our communities and volunteerism. We believe that providing these recognition programs helps drive strong employee performance.
•Create Opportunities for Growth and Development. As of October 29, 2022, approximately 20.8% of our employees are “early in career,” or age 30 and under, 51.4% are “mid-career,” or age 31 to 50, and 27.8% are “late in career,” or age 51 and over. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training and education at all career stages, including opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company, early in career and new graduate networking and development programs, management and leadership development programs, coaching and mentoring programs, and support for continuing education through tuition reimbursement. We operate a leadership succession planning process that aims to develop and retain key talent and ensure business continuity for key roles. We also recently launched a program to identify individuals throughout the organization who have been identified as having high potential for the future growth and development, so that this earlier in career talent can be nurtured for future leadership roles.
•Promote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. Through our “Ciena Cares” community program, we provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations, flexible volunteering during work time, and corporate rewards for service hours that can be donated by employees. In fiscal 2020, we launched our Digital Inclusion initiative, which aims to mobilize our global workforce, leverage our innovation leadership, and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners to bridge the digital divide. Through this initiative, we have funded programming to support underserved students in our global communities by emphasizing digital inclusion and equity through greater connectivity, access to enabling technologies and digital skills development. We have also partnered with Tree-Nation by planting a tree for each existing and new employee at Ciena.
•Promote a Strong Ethical Business Culture. We believe that commitments to good corporate governance and the highest ethical standards are essential to our long-term success, and we are dedicated to instilling in our employees a commitment to integrity and business ethics. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards of conduct for Ciena’s directors, officers and employees. All employees are required to complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and we conduct recurring employee affirmations with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and periodic training and communication related to specific topics contained therein. In addition, we maintain a Corporate Compliance Committee that promotes integrity and compliance leadership throughout Ciena, and a dedicated function focused exclusively on Compliance and Ethics. We also maintain several easily accessible internal and external methods by which our employees, business partners, and investors can report concerns relating to the ethical operation of our business, including anonymously where permitted. We conduct surveys of all employees on our compliance program and culture of integrity in order to assess and strengthen our culture and practices and received feedback from approximately 69% of our employees in fiscal 2022.
Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have prioritized the safety of our employees and business partners, while continuing to support the needs of our customers and communities during this unprecedented period. Beginning in March 2020, we temporarily closed most of our offices globally, implemented travel restrictions and withdrew from certain industry events. Subsequently and in accordance with relevant public health guidance 
and local conditions, we conducted a phased return to our offices and facilities, implemented a hybrid remote/office working model for most of our employees, and resumed certain travel. We have also maintained employee benefits and wellbeing initiatives adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including physical, emotional, mental, and social programming.
Governmental Regulations
Environmental Matters
Environmental regulation is increasing across various jurisdictions, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Our business and operations are currently subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“RoHS”) regulations adopted by the European Union (the “EU”). We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with applicable laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling, and have programs, policies, and customer offerings that help us to address these laws.
Other Regulations 
As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy.”
Access to SEC Reports
Our website address is www.ciena.com. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, available free of charge in the “Investors” section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We routinely post these reports, recent news and announcements, financial results and other important information about our business on our website at www.ciena.com.
