Item 1.     Business
General Overview
Rollins, Inc. (“Rollins,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is an international services company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Through our family of leading brands, we provide essential pest and wildlife control services and protection against termite damage, rodents and insects to more than two million residential and commercial customers from more than 800 Company-owned and franchised locations in over 70 countries. Over the course of our lengthy operating history, we have garnered a reputation for providing great customer service. The contracted and recurring nature of our services provide us with visibility into a significant portion of our future earnings.
In 1964, brothers O. Wayne and John Rollins acquired Orkin Exterminating Company and in 1965 we changed our name from Rollins Broadcasting, Inc to Rollins, Inc. In 1968, Rollins began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ROL”. Since then, we have grown into a premier consumer and commercial services business with numerous industry leading brands including the world renowned Orkin, as well as HomeTeam Pest Defense, Clark Pest Control, Western Pest Services, Critter Control Wildlife, and Northwest Pest Control, among others.
We operate under one reportable segment which contains our three business lines: 

● | Residential: Pest control services protecting residential properties from common pests, including rodents, insects and wildlife;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercial: Workplace pest control solutions for customers across diverse end markets such as healthcare, foodservice, logistics; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Termite: Traditional and baiting termite protection services and ancillary services for both residential and commercial customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
Rollins is a global leader in pest control. We have established a portfolio of premier brands with extensive service capabilities across a deep operating network. Our scale enables delivery of great service and provides a significant and reinforcing competitive advantage through (i) comprehensive capabilities to win new residential and commercial accounts, (ii) technology investments for operations optimization and enhanced customer experience, (iii) route density to manage variable costs, and (iv) financial flexibility to generate organic growth and pursue M&A.
Robust Operating Platform with Proprietary Technology
Our extensive footprint creates an efficient and scalable operating platform to facilitate exceptional customer service delivery, increased cross-selling opportunities, and cost efficiencies. We have strategically invested in proprietary routing and scheduling technologies to increase our competitive advantage, which includes real-time service tracking and customer Internet communication to personalize the customer experience. We also developed and launched our proprietary Branch Operating Support System (“BOSS”), which offers a back-end interface to facilitate service tracking and payment processing for technicians. BOSS also provides virtual route management tools to increase route efficiency across our network, reducing miles driven and associated costs while increasing customer retention through on-time and rapid response service.
Differentiated Employee Base and Service Delivery
Our employees are critical to delivering an outstanding customer experience, and we are highly focused on providing our team with best-in-class training and development opportunities. We operate the 27,000 square foot Rollins Learning Center training facility located in Atlanta, GA, which is a distance-learning and global broadcast facility with simulated environments and classrooms for training. In addition to in-person training, the Rollins Learning Center offers on-demand training sessions that employees can access from anywhere

​

in the world that are produced at our on-site, state-of-the-art broadcast studio. Our unique programs contribute to our position as an employer of choice and have earned us recognition from Training magazine among the Top 125 U.S. Training Companies 16 times in the past 19 years. We continuously monitor co-worker engagement and customer loyalty.
Experienced Management Team
Our management team combines extensive business and consumer services experience with robust local pest control leadership. Consistent with our culture of attracting, developing and progressing talented individuals, our senior leadership team consists of a combination of long-term internal leaders and strategic hires from well-respected external platforms. Our Chairman and CEO, Gary Rollins, is the son of Rollins, Inc. co-founder O. Wayne Rollins and has spent his entire career with the Company, serving as CEO since 2001.
International Business
We continue to expand our international presence through organic growth, international acquisitions, and our international franchise programs. In 2021, we saw revenue growth in our operations in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Singapore. We believe geographic diversity allows us to increase brand recognition, meet demands of global customers, and draw on business and technical expertise from teams in several countries, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets.
Franchising Programs
We have franchise programs through Orkin, Critter Control and our Australian subsidiaries. We had a total of 135, 128 and 134 domestic franchise agreements as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. International franchise agreements totaled 103, 101 and 104 as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Transactions with our franchises involve sales of territories and customer contracts to establish new franchises and the payment of initial franchise fees and royalties by franchisees. The territories, customer contracts and initial franchise fees are typically paid for by a combination of cash and notes. 
Acquisition Strategy
We have extensive experience acquiring companies of all sizes. Over the last three years, we have completed approximately 100 acquisitions, including 39 acquisitions in 2021. Our acquisition strategy targets high quality, profitable businesses with strong leadership that would benefit from incremental growth capital and have the potential to achieve margin expansion through cost and revenue synergies.
Seasonality 
Our business is somewhat affected by weather conditions, including climate change and the seasonal nature of our pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of our pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

​
Materials and Supplies
Our Company has relationships with a vast network of national pest control product distributors, manufacturers and other suppliers for pest and termite control treatment products. We maintain a sufficient level of products, materials, and other supplies to fulfill our immediate servicing needs and to mitigate any potential short-term shortage in availability from our national network of suppliers. We 

4



​

also have qualified comparable products and materials for key categories to have alternatives ready as needed. However, at any time supply chain disruptions that are more than short-term in nature could impact our levels of products, materials and other supplies.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal factors of competition in our pest and termite control markets are the delivery of high quality of service, customer proximity, guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price. Due to our strong direct partnerships with product manufacturers, distributors, and visibility into the inventories, ordering and distribution of materials and supplies, we are able to foresee potential supply disruptions and to quickly adapt. The use of an innovative and industry changing distribution model and technology enables us to maintain adequate supplies for our field operations without a significant investment in warehousing and inventory. 
We believe that, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we compete effectively and favorably with our competitors as one of the world’s largest pest and termite control companies. Our major competitors include Terminix, Ecolab, Rentokil and Anticimex.
Research and Development
Our expenditures on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. We utilize the relationships with our manufacturer and materials suppliers to provide new and innovative products and services, coupled with in-depth reviews by our tenured Technical Services department to ensure they meet our strict requirements. We also conduct tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products and we rely on research performed by leading universities. 
In addition, we also work closely with leading scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.
We maintain close relationships with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection. Some of the new and improved service methods and products are also researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies with a portion of these methods and products being produced to the specifications provided by us.
Environmental and Regulatory Considerations
Our business is subject to various local and national legislative and regulatory enactments including, but not limited to, environmental laws, antitrust laws, employment laws (including wage and hour laws, payroll taxes and anti-discrimination laws), immigration laws, motor vehicle laws and regulations, human health and safety laws, securities laws including, but not limited to, SEC regulations, and federal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and the pest and termite control industry. If we were to fail to comply with any of these applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how the business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Specifically, our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances and wastes and protect the health and safety of our employees. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites we currently own or operate. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services we provide and subjects us to the possibility of regulatory or private actions or proceedings.
Consumer Protection, Privacy and Solicitation Matters
Additionally, we are subject to international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers generally, including laws governing lending, debt collection and consumer finance, consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use 

5



​

of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation. The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission, along with other legal authorities, govern our telephone sales practices. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates our email solicitations and the Consumer Review Fairness Act regulates consumer opinions on social media regarding our products and services. The California Consumer Privacy Act provides consumers the right to know what personal data we collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties.
Franchise Matters
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing franchise sales, marketing and licensing and franchise trade practices generally, including applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. These laws and regulations generally require disclosure of business information in connection with the sale and licensing of our franchises. Certain state regulations also affect our ability as a franchisor, to revoke or refuse to renew a franchise. From time to time, we and one or more franchisees have been, and may in the future become, involved in a dispute regarding the franchise relationship, including payment of royalties or fees, location of branches, advertising, purchase of products by franchisees, non-competition covenants, compliance with our standards or franchise renewal criteria. Any such franchise dispute could possibly have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and a comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1.A. "Risk Factors".
We protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 450 trademarks is a valuable asset that is important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single trademark or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole.
Human Capital
We believe one of the largest contributors to our Company’s success is the quality of our people. Attracting, developing and retaining high-quality talent is the primary objective of our human capital management. The development and retention of high-quality talent leads to a better customer experience and better customer retention. We develop and engage our people through our training at all levels of our organization.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 16,482 employees. Approximately 14,800 of our employees were located in the United States, with approximately 13,700 employees at U.S. branch offices. Of the U.S. employees, less than 2% are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We make it a priority to promote and create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that results in higher levels of satisfaction and engagement, stronger staff retention, higher productivity, and a heightened sense of belonging. Our mission is to have a culture of inclusion, where all individuals feel respected, are treated fairly, with an equitable opportunity to excel. To reinforce our mission, we launched a new global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiative in 2020. We created an Inclusion Advisory Council made up of employees from several different brands across the United States and Canada as a component of this initiative. In 2021 the Executive Leadership team approved a full-time management level position that will spearhead the Workplace Inclusion Strategic Plan. With the 

6



​

continued input from the Advisory Council, the Director’s focus is on implementing the plan, monitoring, evaluating and measuring our efforts. Additionally, towards the end of 2020, we launched MissQuito, which is our first US based company that is led by a black woman. MissQuito began servicing customers in early 2021. Our goal is to create organizational change focusing on inclusion for all employees and connection with all customers.
Health and Safety during COVID-19
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities where we work, live and play. During fiscal 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to execute our pre-established business continuity plans including our pandemic “SAFE Workplace” procedures to maintain compliance with state and local jurisdictions. We continue to limit traffic in and out of our locations. Management also regularly updates our employees and customers on COVID-19 developments in a consistent and timely manner which includes contact information for our Employee Assistance Program.
Community Involvement
We offer employees the opportunity to participate in various community outreach programs and believe that this commitment helps the Company to meet its goals of attracting, developing and retaining high-quality employees. We created Rollins United in 2019 to unify our brands’ philanthropic visions and consolidate our community outreach efforts. Our overarching goal is to create a significant impact in local communities over an extended period of time. The core mission of Rollins United is that everyone deserves a safe place to live, work, and play.
Over the last 40 years, we have partnered with the United Way of Greater Atlanta through employee and company-matching funds, helping make Rollins a community leader for many years. Rollins ranked #11 in the top 25 corporate contributors in 2020 compared to ranking #14 in 2019. Along with personal contributions from employees, the company hosts rallies, contests, and a silent auction to raise funds. Rollins has continued to increase its contributions from a 2020 total of $1.1 million to a 2021 total of $1.2 million.
We also have a partnership with the Grove Park Foundation (the “Foundation”) to help serve our Atlanta community. The partnership allows our employees to volunteer and support the Foundation, which is committed to neighborhood revitalization to improve the quality of life in Northwest Atlanta. Representatives from our Atlanta family of brands participate in volunteer opportunities in the Grove Park neighborhood throughout the year. Additionally, many of our operations engage regularly with their local community efforts throughout the year.

existence of certain anti-takeover provisions in our governance documents, which could make a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive. All of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond our ability to control, and in many cases, we cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

​
Item 1.A.     Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves certain risks. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive. 
Risks Related to our Business, Brand, Industry and Operations
We face risks regarding our ability to maintain our competitive position in the pest control industry in the future.
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in competitors’ prices and general economic issues. We compete with other large pest control companies, as well as numerous smaller pest control companies, for a finite number of customers. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market areas that we serve are quality of service, customer proximity, terms of guarantees, reputation for safety, technical proficiency and price. Although we believe that our experience and reputation for safety and quality service are excellent, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain our competitive position in the future and any competitive pressures we may face could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may not be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate acquisitions or guarantee that any acquisitions will achieve the anticipated financial benefits, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us in the future, or that any acquisitions will achieve the anticipated financial benefits. Our inability to achieve the anticipated financial benefits from any acquisition transactions may not be realized due to any number of factors, including, but not limited to, unsuccessful integration efforts, unexpected or underestimated liabilities or increased costs, fees, expenses and charges related to such transactions. Such adverse events could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets established as a result of such transactions, triggering an impairment. These and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Expanding into international markets presents unique challenges, and our expansion efforts with respect to international operations may not be successful.
An element of our strategy includes further expansion into international markets. Our ability to successfully operate in international markets may be adversely affected by political, economic and social conditions beyond our control, local laws and customs, and legal and regulatory constraints, including compliance with applicable anti-corruption and currency laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our existing and future international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, difficulties in identifying and gaining access to local suppliers, suffering possible adverse tax consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits, maintaining product quality and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
Our business depends on our strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands and develop a positive client reputation could hurt our ability to retain and expand our base of customers.

9



​

Our strong brands, Rollins, Orkin, HomeTeam, Clark Pest Control, Western, Northwest Exterminating, Trutech, Critter Control, IFC, Waltham, and others have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing our brands increases our ability to enter new markets and launch new and innovative services that better serve the needs of our customers. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical failures. Further, if our brands are significantly damaged, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We continue to develop strategies and innovative tools to gain a deeper understanding of customer acquisition and retention in order to more effectively expand and retain our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a service leader and continue to provide high-quality pest control services that are truly beneficial and play a meaningful role in people’s lives.
Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could take actions that could harm our business.
Our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are contractually obligated to operate their businesses in accordance with the standards set forth in our agreements with them and applicable laws and regulations. Each of our brands that are franchised also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors are independent third parties that we do not control, and who own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their businesses, and the ultimate success of any business operation rests with the business owner. If franchisees do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments owed to us will be adversely affected and our brands’ image and reputation could be harmed. This could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Similarly, if franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors do not successfully operate their businesses in a manner consistent with required laws, standards and regulations, we could be subject to claims from regulators or legal claims for the actions or omissions of such third-party franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors. In addition, our relationship with our franchisees, subcontractors, and vendors could become strained (including resulting in litigation) as we impose new standards or assert more rigorous enforcement practices of the existing required standards. These strains in our relationships or any resulting claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
From time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
Labor shortages and/or our ability to attract and retain skilled workers may impair growth potential and profitability.
Our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled workers, create leadership opportunities and successfully implement diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our ability to expand our operations is in part impacted by our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for employees is high, and the supply is limited. COVID-19 has exacerbated labor shortages and the enforcement of COVID-19 mandates may result in additional labor shortages which could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate at full capacity or lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees. A significant increase in the wages paid and benefits offered by competing employers could also result in a reduction in our labor force, increases in our labor costs, or both. Prolonged labor shortages, increased turnover or labor inflation could diminish our profitability and impair our growth potential which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Climate change and unfavorable weather conditions could adversely impact our financial results.
Our operations are directly impacted by the weather conditions worldwide, including catastrophic events, natural disasters and potential impacts from climate change. Climate change continues to receive increasing global attention. The possible effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing storm patterns and intensities, changing temperature levels and changes in legislation, regulation, and international accords, all of which could adversely impact our costs and business operations. The business of our Company is also affected by seasonality associated with our pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue and income of our pest and termite control operations during such periods. The business of the Company is also affected by extreme weather such as drought which can greatly reduce the pest population for extended periods. Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change and any 

10



​

resulting unfavorable weather conditions, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises
Our business, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the restrictions put in place in connection therewith. 
We have responded and continue to respond to the global outbreak of COVID-19 by taking steps to mitigate the potential risks posed to us by its spread and the impact of the restrictions put in place by the local, state and federal governments to protect the population. We continue to execute our comprehensive set of protocols for the health and safety of our employees, customers, and business partners, such as wearing masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment, social distancing and utilizing electronic documents, among others. However, due to the unprecedented uncertainty surrounding the duration of COVID-19, COVID-19 variants, rapidly changing governmental directives, public health challenges and progress, macroeconomic consequences, and market reactions thereto, we are not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and it continues to be challenging for our management to estimate the future performance of our business and develop strategies to generate growth or achieve our objectives for 2022 and beyond. 
In September 2021, the federal government issued an executive order requiring United States based employees, contractors, and subcontractors that work on or in support of United States government contracts, to be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022, and it only permits limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons (the “COVID-19 Executive Order”). On December 7, 2021, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia issued a preliminary nationwide injunction enjoining the enforcement of the COVID-19 Executive Order. The government appealed the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and briefing is due to the Eleventh Circuit by April 4, 2022. 
As a result of the COVID-19 Executive Order, we may be forced to terminate relationships with various United States government agencies we provide services to. Furthermore, certain customers have issued vaccine requirements with respect to our technicians who provide on-site services at our commercial customer’s facilities. The COVID-19 Executive Order along with any customer-specific mandates or rules could result in labor shortages as well as difficulty securing future labor needs, which could impact our ability to provide services to our customers, potentially resulting in material adverse impacts to our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Adverse economic conditions, including inflation and restrictions in customer discretionary expenditures, disruptions in credit or financial markets, increases in fuel prices, raw material costs, or other operating costs could materially adversely affect our business. 
Economic downturns may adversely affect our commercial customers, including food service, hospitality and food processing industries whose business levels are particularly sensitive to adverse economies. For example, we may lose commercial customers and related revenues because of consolidation or cessation of commercial businesses or because these businesses switch to a lower cost provider. Pest and termite services represent discretionary expenditures to many of our residential customers. If consumers restrict their discretionary expenditures, due to inflation or other economic hardships, we may suffer a decline in revenues from our residential service lines. Disruptions in credit or financial markets could make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase the cost of obtaining, financing in the future. In addition, there can be no assurances that fuel prices, raw material costs, or other operating costs, all of which may be subject to inflationary pressures, will not materially increase in future years and we cannot predict the extent to which any such future increases could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy Compliance and Business Disruptions 
The Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, third-party business partners and service providers have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and could be the targets of future attacks which could result in the disruption to the Company’s business operations, economic and reputational damage, and possible fines, penalties and private litigation, if there is unauthorized access to or unintentional distribution of personal, financial, proprietary, confidential, or other protected data or information the Company is entrusted to keep about its customers, employees, business practices, or third parties.
Our internal information technology (“IT”) systems contain certain personal, financial, health, or other protected and confidential information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our IT systems also contain the Company’s and its wholly-owned subsidiaries’ proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, customer lists and product and service development initiatives. From time to time, we have integration with new IT systems due to organic growth and acquisitions. In addition, we grant third-party business partners and service providers access to confidential information in order to facilitate business operations and administer employee benefits. Employees, third-party business partners, and service providers can knowingly or unknowingly disseminate such information or serve as an entry point for bad actors to access such information. For example, in October 2021, one of our third-party information technology Managed Service Providers (“MSP”) was the target of a cybersecurity incident (the “Incident”) resulting in the shutdown of our third-party Customer Relationship Management software used by certain subsidiaries whose aggregate annual revenues comprise less than 11% of our total revenues. There was no known material day-to-day impact to our ability to provide normal service to customers and there was no known indication that the information of our customers or employees was compromised as a result of the Incident. The Incident did not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation or financial condition; however, we may continue to be the target of further cybersecurity incidents that could possibly have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation or financial condition. We are also subject to risks associated with attacks involving our supply chain, such as the vulnerabilities of IT infrastructure management software provided by SolarWinds Corporation. During 2021, we have observed an increase in ransomware attacks in our supply chain. In December 2021, a vulnerability named “Log4Shell” was reported for the widely used Java logging library, ApacheLog4j2. We have reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our IT environment and have taken steps to mitigate the vulnerability; however, there can be no assurances that other similar vulnerabilities or cybersecurity incidents may not occur in the future or may not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation or financial condition.
Our privacy compliance and digital risk management initiatives focus on the threats and risks to enterprise information and the underlying IT systems processing such information as part of the implementation of business processes. The Company also relies on, among other things, commercially available vendors, cybersecurity protection systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of protected information and data. The systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, meet standards set by the payment card industry (“PCI”). We have also implemented policies and procedures, internal training, system controls, and monitoring and audit processes to protect the Company from internal and external vulnerabilities and to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate. Further, the Company limits retention of certain data, encrypts certain data and otherwise protects information to comply with consumer privacy laws in the areas in which we operate.
We continue to evaluate and modify our systems and protocols for data security compliance purposes, and such standards may change from time to time. We monitor certain third-party business partners and service providers for compliance and vulnerabilities. Activities by bad actors, changes in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools and discoveries, cloud applications, changes in multi-jurisdictional regulations, and other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of our systems. Any compromises, breaches, application errors or human mistakes related to our systems or failures to comply with applicable standards could not only disrupt our financial operations, including our customers’ ability to pay for our services and products by credit card or their willingness to purchase our services and products, but could also result in violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, industry standards or agreements and subject us to costs, penalties and liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A breach of data security or failure to comply with rigorous multi-jurisdictional consumer privacy requirements could expose us to customer litigation, regulatory actions and costs related to the reporting and handling of such a violation or breach. Furthermore, while we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may not cover all

liabilities incurred due to a security breach or incident and this could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to Certain Intellectual Property Rights 
Our brand recognition could be impacted if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business. 
Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to service marks, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property rights we own or license, particularly our registered brand names and service marks, Orkin®, Orkin Canada®, HomeTeam Pest Defense®, TAEXX®, Clark Pest Control®, Western Pest Services®, Northwest Exterminating®, Critter Control®, IFC®, Trutech®, Waltham Pest Services®, OPC Services®, Perma Treat Pest and Termite Control®, Crane Pest Control®, Murray Pest Control®, Allpest®, Statewide Pest Control®, Safeguard the Pest Control People®, Aardwolf Pestkare®, Adams Pest Control™, McCall® and others. Although we have sought to register or protect many of our marks either in the United States or in the countries in which they are or may be used, we have not sought to protect our marks in every country. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States. If we are unable to protect our proprietary information and brand names, we could suffer a material adverse effect to our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products, services or activities infringe their intellectual property rights. 
Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Risk Management Matters 
We are from time to time subject to lawsuits, investigations and other proceedings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our operations may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with applicable law or other governmental regulations, including environmental and other regulations relating to the pest control industry. 
In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims, contractual disputes, investigations, arbitrations and litigation, including claims that our acts, omissions, services or vehicles caused damage or injury, claims that our services did not achieve the desired results, claims related to acquisitions, allegations by federal, state or local authorities, including the SEC, of violations of regulations or statutes, claims related to wage and hour law violations and claims related to environmental matters. These claims, proceedings or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
Additionally, our business is significantly affected by and subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial, regional and local governments in the countries in which we operate, including, but not limited to, environmental laws, antitrust laws, consumer protection laws, employment laws, including wage and hour laws, payroll taxes and anti-discrimination laws, immigration, human health and safety laws and other regulations relating to the pest control industry.
We are unable to predict whether such laws will, in the future, materially affect our operations and financial condition or whether any changes will require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such changes. Penalties for noncompliance with these laws may include investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including, but not limited to, cancellation of licenses, fines, and other corrective actions, which could negatively affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The ongoing SEC investigation and any potential related litigation entail risks and uncertainties.
As we previously disclosed, the SEC is conducting an investigation (the “SEC Investigation”). We believe the SEC Investigation is primarily focused on how the Company established accruals and reserves at period-ends for periods beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 and the impact of those accruals and reserves on reported earnings per share, specifically, in the first quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017. The Company is in ongoing discussions with the SEC staff regarding a potential resolution of the SEC Investigation. In light of the foregoing, in accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 450, “Contingencies,” the Company recorded an accrual for $8.0 million related to the SEC Investigation in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, which is reflected in other current liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial position. The ultimate amount of any liability related to the potential resolution of the SEC Investigation could be different from the $8.0 million accrued as of December 31, 2021. The Company will continue to cooperate with the SEC in working towards a final resolution of the SEC Investigation. As we previously reported during the third quarter of 2021, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors initiated a related, supplemental internal investigation. This supplemental investigation was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Company believes that no restatement of its prior period financial statements will be required as a result of the SEC Investigation or matters related thereto.
There can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue action against the Company and its directors or senior officers that could result in potentially significant sanctions and penalties, or that could require the Company to take additional remedial steps, which could include revising or restating portions of our historical net income and earnings per share for the impacted quarterly periods. Potential sanctions against the Company and/or individuals include penalties, injunctions, and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, the Company and its current or former senior officers and directors may be subject to litigation, including by the Company’s stockholders, related to the matters under review by the SEC. Accordingly, the SEC investigation and any potential related litigation in connection with the SEC Investigation entail risks and uncertainties the outcome of which could materially adversely affect our reputation, results of operations, financial position and liquidity, and stock price.
Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.
We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to our business and the services we provide. We maintain commercial liability insurance that extends to products liability. In addition, we also maintain other insurance and other traditional risk transfer tools to respond to certain types of liabilities and risks. However, such tools are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of coverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies are terminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed our coverage limits which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential significant and catastrophic risks. Further, we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable or additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost in the event a significant product or service claim arises. 
Our safety and risk management programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for employee-work related injuries, third party-liability claims or property loss.
Our safety management system and performance measures are critical to our reputation. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to provide service and bid for contracts, and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could experience reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
We attempt to mitigate risks relating to employee work-related injuries, third-party liability, or property loss through the implementation of company-wide safety management programs designed to focus on prevention and decrease the occurrence of accidents or events that may occur. It is expected that any such decreases could also have the effect of stabilizing or reducing our insurance costs. However, incidents involving injury or property loss may be caused by multiple potential factors, a significant number of which are beyond our control. Therefore, there is no guarantee that our safety and risk management and safety programs will have the desired effect of avoiding or controlling all potential expenses and liability exposure.

Risks Related to our Capital and Ownership Structure
The Company’s management has a substantial ownership interest; public stockholders may have no effective voice in the Company’s management.
The Company has elected the “Controlled Company” exemption under Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Listed Company Manual. The Company is a “Controlled Company” because a group that includes the Company’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Gary W. Rollins, and certain companies under his control (the “Controlling Group”), controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company’s voting power. As a “Controlled Company,” the Company need not comply with certain NYSE rules, including, without limitation, the requirements that the Company have a majority of independent directors, and an independent compensation and nominating committee of the Board.
Rollins, Inc.’s executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold directly, or through indirect beneficial ownership, in the aggregate, approximately 53 percent of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2021. As a result, these persons will effectively control the operations of the Company, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as acquisitions and approval of matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of the Company at a premium.
Our management has a substantial ownership interest, and the availability of the Company’s common stock to the investing public may be limited.
The availability of Rollins’ common stock to the investing public is limited to those shares not held by the executive officers, directors and their affiliates, which could negatively impact Rollins’ stock trading prices and affect the ability of minority stockholders to sell their shares. Future sales by executive officers, directors and their affiliates of all or a portion of their shares could also negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.
The Controlling Group could take various actions or engage in certain transactions that could negatively impact our common stock price, cause volatility in the market for our common stock or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition.
The Controlling Group may from time to time and at any time, in their sole discretion, acquire or cause to be acquired, additional equity or other instruments of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or derivative instruments the value of which is linked to Company securities, or dispose or cause to be disposed, such equity or other securities or instruments, in any amount that the Controlling Group may determine in their sole discretion, through open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In addition, depending upon a variety of factors, the Controlling Group may at any time engage in discussions with the Company and its affiliates, and other persons, including retained outside advisers, concerning the Company’s business, management, strategic alternatives and direction, and in their sole discretion, consider, formulate and implement various plans or proposals intended to enhance the value of their investment in the Company, including, among other things, proposing or effecting any matter that would constitute or result in: (i) the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Company or the disposition of securities of the Company, in addition to the possible normal course dissolution of additional entities for estate or tax planning purposes; (ii) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any subsidiary thereof; (iii) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any subsidiary thereof; (iv) a change in the present board of directors or management of the Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (v) a material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Company; (vi) other material changes in the Company’s business or corporate structure; (vii) changes in the Company’s charter, bylaws, or instruments corresponding thereto, or other actions which may impede the acquisition of control of the Company by any person; (viii) causing a class of securities of the Company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; or (ix) a class of equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In the event the Controlling Group were to engage in any of the actions enumerated above, our common stock price could be negatively impacted, such actions could cause volatility in the market for our common stock or could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.

Certain provisions in Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover of the Company.
Rollins, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other documents contain provisions including advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and staggered terms for the Board of Directors. These provisions may make a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors more difficult or expensive.
