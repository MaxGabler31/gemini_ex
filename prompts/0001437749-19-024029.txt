Recent Financing Activities
 
Since November 2011, Mr. Shrewsbury, our CEO, has provided financing to us that, in addition to a bank term loan, we have relied upon to fund and expand our business operations. On February 25, 2014, Mr. Shrewsbury agreed to consolidate and restructure this indebtedness and we issued in exchange for such indebtedness a Consolidated Secured Promissory Note (the “Consolidated Note”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000. The Consolidated Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum or prime rate if higher than 5% per annum is repayable in full ten years from the date of issuance and is subject to certain events of default. Payment of the Consolidated Note is secured by the death benefit proceeds of a $2 million key man term life insurance policy purchased by the Company on the life of Mr. Shrewsbury which has been assigned to Mr. Shrewsbury. In addition, in consideration of Mr. Shrewsbury agreeing to consolidate the indebtedness, the Company granted to Mr. Shrewsbury options to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, issued February 25, 2014. The options were exercisable at a price of $0.0924 per share subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock dividends, subdivisions, capital reorganizations, a consolidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets. The options were exercisable for a period of three years commencing April 1, 2014 and expired on March 31, 2017.
 
As of September 30, 2019, Mr. Shrewsbury had advanced to the Company an additional $181,487 which is not interest bearing and is repayable upon demand.
 
During fiscal 2015 and through December 3, 2015, we maintained a $750,000 line of credit with a bank. On December 3, 2015, we refinanced the line of credit with a new term loan from the bank in the amount of $711,376 and utilized the proceeds of the new loan to repay the line of credit. The new loan is for a term of five years and matures on December 3, 2020. During the term of the loan, we have agreed to make equal monthly repayments of principal and interest of $6,967 commencing January 3, 2016 and make a final payment on December 3, 2020, of the outstanding balance of the interest and principal then due, estimated to be approximately $391, 896. Interest under the new loan is variable and is based upon the Wall Street Journal Prime rate, currently 5.00% per annum. In the event of a default, interest under the loan may be increased by 2%. The line of credit is secured by a priority security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable and is guaranteed by our CEO.
 
The Consolidated Note and advances due to Mr. Shrewsbury are subordinate to the Company’s bank indebtedness.
 
Our Business
 
Background

Mining and Rail Supplies
 
We supply and distribute rail products including rail, switches, ties and related products, and drill bits, augurs, related tools and mining supplies to U.S. coal mine operators and distributors primarily located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia.
 
Although, the Company has experienced an increase in sales starting in the second fiscal quarter of 2017 as compared to the two prior years, when the U.S. Coal industry was facing declining U.S. coal production and bankruptcies and restructurings among certain U.S. coal companies, the demand for, and production of, coal continue to be adversely affected by several factors, including increased environmental regulation in the U.S., declining coal consumption in the electric power sector, increased competition from natural gas, and a strong U.S. dollar.
 
 4



The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasted in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) released October 8, 2019, that U. S. coal production will decline by 10% to 679MMst in 2019, which would be a 76MMst decline from the 2018 level. Declining coal demand and related bankruptcies, ownership changes, and sudden closures have contributed to a fluctuating production environment. The EIA also expects coal production to decline further by 11% in 2020 to 603MMst.
 
Coal consumption in the United States decreased for the fifth consecutive year in 2018, reaching 13.2 quads, the lowest level since 1975 and about half of its peak in 2005. In 1950, nearly half of the U.S. coal consumption was in the industrial sector (47%), and the transportation sector also consumed a significant share (13%). However, since the 1960s nearly all U.S. coal has been used to generate electricity. In 2018, the electric power sector accounted for 91% of U.S. coal consumption.
 
The United States is a net exporter of coal. The U.S coal exports reached a high of 126MMst equal to 12% of U.S. coal production in 2012. U.S. coal export decline each year from 2012 through 2016 and then increased in 2017 and 2018, the United States exported about 116 MMst of coal which equal about 15% of U.S. coal production. The coal is exported to at least 52 countries with the top five destination going to India, The Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and Brazil.
 
EIA expects U.S. CO2 emissions in 2019 to decline because the share of electricity generated from natural gas and renewables will increase while the share generated from coal, which is more carbon-intensive energy source, will decrease.
 
Continued distress in the U.S. coal mining industry will materially affect the demand for our products.
 
Principal Products
 
Drilling Products
 
We distribute and sell drill steel mining products for use in the coal mining industry, including:
 
● | drill bit products and accessories, used for hard and soft rock mining operations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | tungsten carbide drill bits and augurs, and 
● | related accessories and tools. 

Rail Products
 
We distribute and sell drill steel mining products used by the coal industry in its extraction process, including:
 

● | tee rails, used for railroad tracks for the transportation of coal by coal mine operators;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | steel ties for securing rail; 
● | switches, and 
● | related accessories and tools. 

Cyclicality
 
Changes in economic conditions affecting the global and domestic mining industry can occur abruptly and unpredictably, which may have significant effects on our sales. Cyclicality is driven, primarily, by price volatility of coal, as well as product life cycles, competitive pressures and other economic factors affecting the mining industry, such as company consolidations and mergers, bankruptcies, increased regulation of the coal mining or electrical utility industry, and competition affecting demand for coal, and the broader economy, including changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and from market expectations with respect to such policies. Falling prices for coal have in the past, and may in the future, lead to reduced production levels of existing mines, a contraction in the number of existing mines and the closure of less efficient mines, and are likely to lead to a decrease in demand for our mining supplies and rail products. Conversely, rising coal prices typically lead to the expansion of existing mines, opening of new mines or re-opening of less efficient mines. Increased mining activity typically leads to an increase in demand for our mining supplies and rail products.
 
 5



Seasonality
 
Our business is subject to moderate seasonality, with the first quarter of our fiscal year (October to December), generally experiencing lower sales than the last three quarters of our fiscal year.
Manufacturers and Suppliers
 
Our drill steel mining products, drill bits, and related products are manufactured and supplied to us by several manufacturers located overseas. Our rail products are supplied to us by several suppliers located overseas and, in the U.S.
 
Management does not believe that the loss of any of such manufacturers or suppliers would adversely affect the Company’s business and believes that alternative manufacturers and suppliers would be readily available to us.
 
Distribution and Sales
 
We sell our mining supplies and rail products primarily through two independent sales agent and, to a limited extent, directly to our customers. Our sales agents are independent contractors and are compensated on a commission basis. Our sales agents sell our mining supplies to resellers as well as directly to coal mine operators.
 
Our products are delivered to us at our warehouse in Ashland, Kentucky, from where they are shipped to our customers primarily by road. Shipping costs are normally paid for by the purchaser.
 
Customers
 
We distribute and sell our mining supplies and rail products principally to certain coal mining companies located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia and certain distributors. Our customers include both large and small mining companies and operators. During the year ended September 30, 2019, one customer accounted for approximately 30% of our revenues (35% in 2018), and accounted for less than 1% of our accounts receivable (45% in 2018) as of the year end, one customer accounted for approximately 24% of our revenues (11% in 2018), one customer accounted for approximately 6% of our revenues (6% in 2018) and, one customer accounted for approximately 5% of our revenues ( 2% in 2018) All remaining customers account for less than 5% of our revenue. The loss of any one or more of our major customers or if our inability to collect on outstanding accounts receivable from one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We continue to seek to increase our customer base and reduce our reliance on a limited number of customers.
Competitive Business Conditions
 
We compete with large and small manufacturers and suppliers of drill bits and other cutting tools and related products to the U.S. coal mining industry. We compete with several manufacturers and distributors of mine rail and related products. Many of our competitors are large manufacturers or distributors or divisions of large companies, however, our industry remains relatively fragmented with several hundred fabricators and toolmakers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and more established relationships in the industry than we have. We believe we compete on the basis of the reliability, quality and performance of our products, competitive pricing, prompt delivery and good customer service and support.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
In connection with our mining and rail supplies business, we rely on a combination of common law trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our proprietary rights and promote our reputation and the growth of our business. We do not own any patents with regard to our rail or mining products that would prevent or inhibit our competitors from using our products or entering our market, although we may seek such protection in the future.
 
We do not require our employees, consultants and independent contractors to enter into agreements containing non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions and covenants, accordingly, we rely only upon common law protections to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights or to deter independent third-party development of products similar to the products we distribute and sell.
 
 6



Governmental Regulation
 
We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulation of the distribution of mining supplies and rail products. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we sell our products, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements. We do not believe our current business is subject to any environmental or similar laws. However, we may become subject to product liability claims related to the products we distribute and sell.
 
In connection with our prior oil and gas business operations, we were subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In particular, our exploration, development and production operations, our activities in connection with storage and transportation of oil and other hydrocarbons and our use of facilities for treating, processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related wastes may be subject to regulation under these and similar state legislation.
 
If it is subsequently determined that we failed to comply with these laws and regulations we may be subject to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines, penalties or other liability, or the imposition of injunctive relief that could have a material adverse impact on us and our financial condition.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain general liability insurance and auto coverage liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 to cover certain liabilities associated with the distribution of our mining supplies and rail products.
 
We purchased a $2 million key man term life insurance policy on the life of our CEO (William Shrewsbury) that has been assigned to Mr. Shrewsbury as security for a loan he has made to us. In addition, we purchased a $500,000 key man term life insurance policy on the life of our CFO (Jose Fuentes) that has been assigned to Mr. Fuentes to cover prior years’ accrued but unpaid compensation.
Research and Development Expenditure
 
No research and development cost were incurred in 2019 or 2018.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2019, we employed four full-time employees. None of our employees are a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Also, we employ certain consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the marketing and sale of our products. Our sales agents are compensated on a commission basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES
 
BUSINESS
 
TX Holdings, Inc, a Georgia corporation (the "Company", “we”, ‘us” or “our” ), is in the business of supplying, distributing and selling drill bits, related tools, and other mining supplies and rail products to United States’ coal mining companies and operators for use in their extraction and transportation processes. Our products are either shipped to our warehouse in Ashland, Kentucky, for distribution to our customers or shipped directly to our customers, including products we import once they have been received by us at a port and cleared customs. Our products are transported primarily by ground transportation to our customers. Shipping costs are born by our customers.
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Georgia on May 15, 2000.
 
Rail and Mining Supplies Distribution Business
 
Commencing in December 2011, the Company expanded and began focusing its business on the distribution of rail material and mining supplies consumed by the United States’ coal mining industry in its production and transportation processes. This includes rail and its various components and mining supplies, such as steel and tungsten carbide miner bits and augurs and related tools and material.
 
In connection with the Company’s business expansion, Mr. Shrewsbury, the Company’s Chairman and CEO, has provided us with financing in the form of loans and advances and has guaranteed our bank term loan.
 
On February 25, 2014, the Company and Mr. Shrewsbury entered into an agreement to consolidate certain indebtedness due to Mr. Shrewsbury in the aggregate amount of $2,000,000, including the principal due under a Revolving Demand Note (“Revolving Note”) in the principal amount of $1,062,000 and accrued but unpaid interest due thereunder as of January 31, 2014 in the amount of $168,905, the principal due under a 10% Promissory Note (“10% Note”) in the amount of $289,997 and accrued but unpaid interest due thereunder as of January 31, 2014 in the amount of $93,252; and $385,846 of non-interest bearing advances previously made by Mr. Shrewsbury and outstanding as of January 31, 2014. The Company issued in exchange and in replacement therefor a Consolidated Secured Promissory Note (the “Consolidated Note”) in the principal amount of $2,000,000. Upon issuance of the Consolidated Note, the Revolving Note and 10% Note were cancelled, and Mr. Shrewsbury agreed to waive any prior defaults under the terms of such notes and to release the Company from any claims related thereto. In addition, in consideration of Mr. Shrewsbury agreeing to consolidate and restructure the foregoing indebtedness, the Company granted to Mr. Shrewsbury options to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, issued February 25, 2014. The options were exercisable for a period of three years commencing April 1, 2014. The options were exercisable at a price of $0.0924 per share subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock dividends, subdivisions, capital reorganizations, a consolidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets. The options expired on March 31, 2017.
 
The Consolidated Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum or prime rate if higher than 5% per annum, is repayable in full ten years from the date of issuance and is subject to certain events of default. Payment of the Consolidated Note is to be secured or otherwise payable by the Company out of the death benefit proceeds of key man insurance of $2 million that has been purchased by the Company on the life of Mr. Shrewsbury.

NOTE 1- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES-Continued
 
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS
 
Although the Company had positive cash flows during earlier years, the Company has not generated sufficient cash during recent years to fund its operations and relies substantially upon financing provided by Mr. Shrewsbury, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, and a term loan that is guaranteed by Mr. Shrewsbury.
 
In view of these matters, realization of certain assets in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations, which, in turn, is dependent upon our ability to meet our financial requirements, upon the continued availability of financing from Mr. Shrewsbury and under the Company’s bank term loan, and the success of our future operations.
 
The Company has incurred significant losses from operations since inception and has a stockholders’ deficit, both of which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company will continue its on-going efforts to increase our customer base and seek lower cost suppliers to generate future operating profits.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuing operations and realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to implement successfully its business plan and to become financially viable. The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded assets nor the implications of associated bankruptcy costs should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
The financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and U. S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions and calculated estimates that affect (a) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (b) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and (c) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH FLOWS
 
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash includes demand deposits, time deposits, certificates of deposit and short-term liquid investments in government securities with original maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains deposits in two financial institutions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides coverage up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. At September 30, 2019, none of the Company’s cash was in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risks from these deposits.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
 
The Company’s practice is to record an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The estimate is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts and includes consideration for credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. The Company reviews historical experience with its customers, the general economic environment and the aging of receivables to determine the adequacy of the allowance. The Company records an allowance to reduce receivables to the amount that can be reasonably expected to be collectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is $0 at September 30, 2019 and 2018.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS-Continued
 
The Company wrote-off two uncollectable customer’s account, due to bankruptcy and uncollectable balance in the amount of $14,621, during the current year. During fiscal year 2018 the Company wrote-off one uncollectable customer’s account due to bankruptcy in the amount of $38,920.
INVENTORY
 
The Company’s inventory consists of mine and rail inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.

The following table details the inventory components:
 
 
 | Year Ended | 
----------+------------+----------
 | 9/30/2019 | | 9/30/2018 | 
Inventory | | | | | 
Mining | $ | 650,043 | | $ | 729,169 
Rail | | 1,181,586 | | | 1,069,371
Total | $ | 1,831,629 | | $ | 1,798,540

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do not materially improve or extend the useful lives of the assets are charged to expense as incurred. A depreciable life of seven (7) years and five (5) years are assigned to delivery trucks and equipment, respectively. Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets (Note 2).
REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),” using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of the new revenue standard had no impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date.
 
We recognize revenue on sales to customers and distributors upon satisfaction of our performance obligations when the goods are shipped. For consignment sales, we recognize revenue when the goods are pulled from consignment inventory.
 
The Company’s revenue stream is generated from sales of mine and rail related products. Sales are initiated directly from customers' orders or through a sales agent. Revenue is recognized generally upon shipment or delivery to our customers, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer is obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products.
 
We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from our customers in revenue. We expense shipping and handling costs as incurred which are included in cost of goods sold on the statements of operations.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
 
The Company accounts for share-based expense and activity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) ASC Topic 718 which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for services. Under this provision share-based compensation
 costs are measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and are recognized as an expense over employee’s requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the equity grant.
 
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, expected option term, expected volatility of the stock over the option’s expected term, risk-free interest rate over the option’s expected term and the expected annual dividend yield. The Company believes that the valuation technique and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of the stock options granted.
 
POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
 
As of September 30, 2019, and 2018 there were no outstanding options and warrants.

INCOME TAXES
 
Income taxes are estimated for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent future tax consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled.
 
Deferred taxes may also be recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income. Deferred taxes are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates when those changes are enacted.
 
In assessing the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
The Company includes fair value information in the notes to the financial statements when the fair value of its financial instruments is different from the book value. When the book value approximates fair value, no additional disclosure is made, which is the case for financial instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2019 and 2018. The book value of those financial instruments that are classified as current assets or liabilities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. For non-current financial instruments, the Company uses quoted market prices or, to the extent that there are no quoted market prices, market prices for similar instruments.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
 
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
 U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation
 adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the customer’s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time.
 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
 
Net income or loss per share is computed based on current accounting guidance requiring companies to report both basic net income or loss per common share, which is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted net income per common share, which is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted average dilutive potential common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method.
 
As of September 30, 2019 and 2018 there were no unissued securities which were not included in the calculation of diluted net earnings per share.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those periods. The standard permits early adoption, but not before December 15, 2016, and permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
 
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606),” using the modified
 retrospective method. Adoption of the new revenue standard had no impact on the Company’s balance sheet, results of
 operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date.
 
We recognize revenue on sales to customers and distributors upon satisfaction of our performance obligations when the goods are
 shipped. For consignment sales, we recognize revenue when the goods are pulled from consignment inventory.
 .
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires all leases that have a term of over 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet with the liability for lease payments and the corresponding right-of-use asset initially measured at the present value of amounts expected to be paid over the term. Recognition of the costs of these leases on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification as either an operating or a financing lease. Costs of an operating lease will continue to be recognized as a single operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Costs for a financing lease will be disaggregated and recognized as both an operating expense (for the amortization of the right-of-use asset) and interest expense (for interest on the lease liability). This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning on or after January1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. We implemented the standard on October 1, 2019 and the new standard did not have an impact on our financial statements.

 NOTE 8 – BANK LOAN
 
In November 2012, the Company obtained a $250,000 line of credit from a bank. On August 26, 2014, the bank increased the Company’s existing bank line of credit from $250,000 to $750,000 and extended the term of the line of credit. The line of credit was secured by a priority security interest in the Company’s inventory and accounts receivable and matured on November 7, 2015. On December 3, 2015, the Company entered into a new loan agreement with the Bank under which it obtained a term loan in the amount of $711,376. The Company utilized proceeds of the new loan to repay its line of credit. The loan is for a term of five years and matures on December 3, 2020. As of September 30, 2019, the loan balance was $494,370.
 
During the term of the loan, the Company has agreed to make equal monthly repayments of principal and interest of $6,967 commencing January 3, 2016, and to make a final payment on December 3, 2020, of the outstanding balance of the interest and principal then due, estimated to be approximately $425,539. Early repayment of amounts due under the loan will not affect the monthly repayment amount, unless otherwise agreed to by the bank.
 
An event of default under the loan will occur upon the occurrence of any of the following events:
