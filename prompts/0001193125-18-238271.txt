ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 We are a leading provider of data storage technology and solutions. Our principal products are hard disk drives, commonly referred to as disk drives, hard drives or HDDs. In addition to HDDs, we produce a broad range of data storage products including solid state drives (SSDs), solid state hybrid drives (SSHDs) and storage subsystems. 
 Hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces. Disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes, high quality and cost effectiveness. Complementing existing data center storage architecture, solid-state storage devices use integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data, and most SSDs use NAND flash memory. In addition to HDDs and SSDs, SSHDs combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a high capacity hard disk drive and a smaller SSD acting as a cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data. 
 Our HDD products are designed for mission critical and nearline applications in enterprise servers and storage systems; edge compute/client compute applications, where our products are designed primarily for desktop and mobile computing; and edge non-compute/client non-compute applications, where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as portable external storage systems, surveillance systems, digital video recorders (DVRs), network-attached storage (NAS) and gaming consoles. Our SSD products mainly include serial attached SCSI (SAS) and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs. 
 Our cloud systems and solutions portfolio includes modular original equipment manufacturer (OEM) storage systems and scale-out storage servers. 
 Industry Overview 
 Data Storage Industry 
 The data storage industry is comprised of companies that manufacture components or subcomponents designed for data storage devices and companies that provide storage solutions, software and services for enterprise cloud, big data, computing platforms and consumer markets. We believe the proliferation and personal creation of media-rich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher capacity storage solutions. 
Markets 
 The principal markets served by us include: 
 Enterprise Storage. We define enterprise storage as dedicated storage area networks and hyperscale cloud storage environments. Enterprise and cloud data centers run solutions which are designed for mission critical, nearline and enterprise serial attached SCSI SSDs applications. 
 Mission critical applications are defined as those that are vital to the operation of large-scale enterprise workloads, requiring high performance and high reliability storage solutions. We expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises utilizing dedicated storage area networks. Our storage solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies. 
 Nearline applications are defined as those which require high capacity and energy efficient storage solutions. We expect such applications, which include storage for cloud computing, content delivery and backup services, will continue to grow and drive demand for solutions designed with these attributes. With the increased requirements for storage capacity and performance driven by the creation and consumption of media-rich digital content, we expect the increased exabyte demand will require further build-out of data centers by cloud service providers (CSPs) and other enterprises which utilize high capacity nearline devices. 
 Enterprise SAS SSDs are designed to deliver superior performance, reliability and enterprise features to meet the demands of I/O-intensive applications, with potential for substantial power savings. NVMe SSDs and add-in cards are designed to optimize enterprise applications with a persistent, high-performance, high-capacity memory design. They also leverage flash and software to accelerate any server virtualized deployment and move any big data to the realm of real time.

 Edge Compute/Client Compute. We define edge compute/client compute applications as solutions designed for desktop and mobile compute applications ranging from traditional laptops to convertible systems. As storage of digital content in the cloud becomes more prevalent, accessible and affordable, some edge compute/client compute applications rely less on built-in storage, and instead have transitioned to cloud storage and computing solutions along with branded external hard drives. 
 Edge Non-Compute/Client Non-Compute. We define edge non-compute/client non-compute applications as solutions designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage. Disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as surveillance systems, DVRs, NAS and gaming consoles that require a higher capacity, low cost-per-gigabyte storage solution. Disk drives for external storage are designed for purposes such as portable external storage, and to augment storage capacity in the consumers current desktop, notebook, tablet or mobile phone devices. 
 Cloud Systems and Solutions. We define cloud systems and solutions as applications that provide solutions to businesses for the purpose of modular systems and scale-out storage solutions. Systems can contain HDDs and SSDs and may offer file management systems, software and compute power. 
 Participants in the data storage industry include: 
 Major subcomponent manufacturers. Companies that manufacture components or subcomponents used in data storage devices or solutions include companies that supply spindle motors, heads and media and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). 
 Storage solutions manufacturers. Companies that transform components into storage products include disk drive manufacturers and semiconductor storage manufacturers which integrate flash memory into storage products such as SSDs. 
 System integrators. Companies, such as OEMs, that bundle and package storage solutions, distributors that integrate storage hardware and software into end-user applications and CSPs that provide cloud based solutions to businesses for the purpose of scale-out storage solutions and modular systems. 
 Hyperscale Data Centers. Large hyperscale data center companies which are increasingly designing their own storage subsystems and having them built by contract manufacturers for use inside their own data centers. This trend is reshaping the storage system and subsystem market and driving innovation in system design and changes in the competitive landscape of large storage system vendors. 
 Storage services. Companies that provide and host services and solutions, which include storage, backup, archiving, recovery and discovery of data. 
 Demand for Data Storage 
 The International Data Corporation (IDC) forecasted in its 2017 Data Age 2025 study that the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025. According to IDC, we are fast approaching a new era of the data age, which we expect will have a positive impact on storage demand. We believe that the continued advancement of the cloud, the further development of edge computing, the global proliferation of mobile devices, the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), the increasing use of video surveillance, the evolution of consumer electronic devices, and the enterprise use of big data analytics are driving the growth of digital content. Factors contributing to the growth of digital content include: 

 | Creation, sharing, and consumption of media-rich digital content, such as high-resolution photos, high definition videos, and digital music through smart phones, tablets, digital cameras, personal video cameras, DVRs, gaming consoles or other digital devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Creation, aggregation and distribution of digital content through services and other offerings such as Facebook®, Instagram®, iTunes®, Netflix®, Google® and YouTube®;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increasing use of video surveillance and the emergence of new surveillance systems which feature higher resolution digital cameras and thus require larger data storage capacities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Seagate Technology public limited company | 2018 Form 10-K | 4 


 
 | Creation and collection of data through the development and evolution of the IoT ecosystem, big data analytics (including enterprise use of big data analytics) and new technology trends such as self-driving cars and drones;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continued advancement of the cloud, including the build out of large numbers of cloud data centers by CSPs and private companies transitioning on-site data centers into the cloud; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Protection of increased digital content through redundant storage on backup devices and externally provided storage services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of these factors, we anticipate that the nature and volume of content being created will require greater storage, which is more efficiently and economically facilitated by higher capacity storage devices in order to store, manage, distribute, analyze and backup such content. We expect this to support the growth in demand for data storage solutions in developed and emerging economies. 
 In addition, the economics of storage infrastructure are also evolving with the utilization of public and private hyper-scale storage and open-source solutions reducing the total cost of ownership of storage while increasing the speed and efficiency with which customers can leverage massive computing and storage devices. Accordingly, we expect these trends will continue to create significant demand for data storage solutions going forward. 
 Demand Trends 
 We believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store, aggregate, host, distribute, analyze, manage, protect, backup and use such content. We also believe that as architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world, the storage solutions will evolve as well. 
 We expect increased data creation will lead to the expansion of the need for storage in the form of both HDDs and SSDs. While the advance of solid state technology in many end markets is expected to increase, we believe that in the foreseeable future, cloud, traditional enterprise, client and consumer markets that require high-capacity storage solutions will be best served by hard disk drives due to their ability to deliver the most cost effective, reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices. We also believe that as hard disk drive capacities continue to increase, a focus exclusively on unit demand does not reflect the increase in demand for exabytes. This has resulted in demand for fewer units, but with higher average capacity per drive. 
 Industry Supply Balance 
 From time to time, the storage industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand. To the extent that the storage industry builds or maintains capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize, price erosion may become more pronounced. Conversely, during periods where demand exceeds supply, price erosion is generally muted. 
Our Business 
 Disk Drive Technology 
 The design and manufacturing of disk drives depends on highly advanced technology and manufacturing techniques and therefore requires high levels of research and development spending and capital equipment investments. We design, fabricate and assemble a number of the most important components in our disk drives, including read/write heads and recording media. Our design and manufacturing operations are based on technology platforms that are used to produce various disk drive products that serve multiple data storage applications and markets. Our core technology platforms are focused around the areal density of media and read/write head technologies. This design and manufacturing approach allows us to deliver a portfolio of disk drive products to service a wide range of data storage applications and industries. 
 Disk drives that we manufacture are commonly differentiated by the following key characteristics: 
 

 | storage capacity, commonly expressed in gigabytes (GB) or terabytes (TB), which is the amount of data that can be stored on the disk drive;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | spindle rotation speed, commonly expressed in revolutions per minute (RPM), which has an effect on speed of access to data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Seagate Technology public limited company | 2018 Form 10-K | 5 


 
 | interface transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data moves between the disk drive and the computer controller;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | average seek time, commonly expressed in milliseconds, which is the time needed to position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | data transfer rate, commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the rate at which data is transferred to and from the disk drive;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | input/output operations per second (IOPS), commonly expressed in megabytes per second, which is the maximum number of reads and writes to a storage location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product quality and reliability, commonly expressed in annualized return rates; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | energy efficiency, commonly measured by the power output necessary to operate the disk drive.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Areal density is measured by storage capacity per square inch on the recording surface of a disk. The storage capacity of a disk drive is determined by the number of disks it contains as well as the areal density capability of these disks. We have been pursuing, and will continue to pursue, a number of technologies to increase areal densities across the entire range of our products for expanding disk drive capacities and reducing the number of disks and heads per drive to further reduce product costs. 
 Manufacturing 
 We design and produce our own read/write heads and recording media, which are critical technologies for disk drives. This integrated approach enables us to lower costs and to improve the functionality of components so that they work together efficiently. 
 We believe that because of our vertical design and manufacturing strategy, we are well suited to take advantage of the opportunities to leverage the close interdependence of components for disk drives. Our manufacturing efficiency and flexibility are critical elements of our integrated business strategy. We continuously seek to improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce manufacturing costs by: 
 

 | employing manufacturing automation;
--+------------------------------------


 | utilizing machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | improving product quality and reliability;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | integrating our supply chain with suppliers and customers to enhance our demand visibility and reduce our working capital requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | coordinating between our manufacturing group and our research and development organization to rapidly achieve volume manufacturing; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | operating our facilities at optimal capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 A vertically integrated model, however, tends to have less flexibility when demand moderates as it exposes us to higher unit costs when capacity utilization is not optimized. 
 Components and Raw Materials 
 Disk drives incorporate certain components, including a head disk assembly and a printed circuit board mounted to the head disk assembly, which are sealed inside a rigid base and top cover containing the recording components in a contamination controlled environment. We maintain a highly integrated approach to our business by designing and manufacturing a significant portion of the components we view as critical to our products, such as read/write heads and recording media. 
 Read/Write Heads. The function of the read/write head is to scan across the disk as it spins, magnetically recording or reading information. The tolerances of read/write heads are extremely demanding and require state-of-the-art equipment and 
 
Seagate Technology public limited company | 2018 Form 10-K | 6 


  processes. Our read/write heads are manufactured with thin-film and photolithographic processes similar to those used to produce semiconductor integrated circuits, though challenges related to magnetic film properties and topographical structures are unique to the disk drive industry. We perform all primary stages of design and manufacture of read/write heads at our facilities. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced read/write heads, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels. 
 Media. Data is written to or read from the media, or disk, as it rotates at very high speeds past the read/write head. The media is made from non-magnetic substrates, usually an aluminum alloy or glass, and is coated with thin layers of magnetic materials. We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced finished media and aluminum substrates, the mix of which varies based on product mix, technology and our internal capacity levels. We purchase all of our glass substrates from third parties. 
 Printed Circuit Board Assemblies. The printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) are comprised of standard and custom ASICs and ancillary electronic control chips. The ASICs control the movement of data to and from the read/write heads and through the internal controller and interface, which communicates with the host computer. The ASICs and control chips form electronic circuitry that delivers instructions to a head positioning mechanism called an actuator to guide the heads to the selected track of a disk where the data is recorded or retrieved. Disk drive manufacturers use one or more industry standard interfaces such as serial advanced technology architecture (SATA); small computer system interface (SCSI); SAS; or fiber channel to communicate to the host systems. We outsource to third parties the manufacture and assembly of the PCBAs used in our disk drives. We do not manufacture any ASICs, but we participate in their design. 
 Head Disk Assembly. The head disk assembly consists of one or more disks attached to a spindle assembly powered by a spindle motor that rotates the disks at a high constant speed around a hub. Read/write heads, mounted on an arm assembly, similar in concept to that of a record player, fly extremely close to each disk surface and record data on and retrieve it from concentric tracks in the magnetic layers of the rotating disks. The read/write heads are mounted vertically on an E-shaped assembly (E-block) that is actuated by a voice-coil motor to allow the heads to move from track to track. The E-block and the recording media are mounted inside the head disk assembly. We purchase spindle motors from outside vendors and from time to time participate in the design of the motors that go into our products. 
 Disk Drive Assembly. Following the completion of the head disk assembly, it is mated to the PCBA, and the completed unit goes through extensive defect mapping and machine learning prior to packaging and shipment. Disk drive assembly and machine learning operations occur primarily at our facilities located in China and Thailand. We perform subassembly and component manufacturing operations at our facilities in China, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. In addition, third parties manufacture and assemble components for us in various countries worldwide. 
 Suppliers of Components and Industry Constraints. There are a limited number of independent suppliers of components, such as recording heads and media, available to disk drive manufacturers. Vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers, who manufacture their own components, are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers. However, our business has been adversely affected by our suppliers capacity constraints in the past and this could occur again. 
 Commodity and Other Manufacturing Costs. The production of disk drives requires rare earth elements, precious metals, scarce alloys and industrial commodities, which are subject to fluctuations in price and the supply of which has at times been constrained. In addition to increased costs of components and commodities, volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities, manufacturing and freight. As a result, we may increase our use of alternative shipment methods to help offset any increase in freight costs, and will continually review various forms of shipments and routes in order to minimize the exposure to higher freight costs.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------

 OEM customers, including cloud service providers, typically enter into master purchase agreements with us. These agreements provide for pricing, volume discounts, order lead times, product support obligations and other terms and conditions including sales programs offered to promote selected products. Deliveries are scheduled only after receipt of purchase orders. In addition, with limited lead-time, customers may defer most purchase orders without significant penalty. Anticipated orders from many of our customers have in the past failed to materialize or OEM delivery schedules have been deferred or altered as a result of changes in their business needs. 
 Our distributors generally enter into non-exclusive agreements for the resale of our products. They typically furnish us with a non-binding indication of their near-term requirements and product deliveries are generally scheduled accordingly. The agreements and related sales programs typically provide the distributors with limited rights of return and price protection rights. In addition, we offer sales programs to distributors on a quarterly and periodic basis to promote the sale of selected products in the sales channel. 
 Our retail channel consists of our branded storage products sold to retailers either by us directly or by our distributors. Retail sales made by us or our distributors typically require greater marketing support, sales incentives and price protection periods. 
 In fiscal year 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, Dell Inc. accounted for approximately 10% and 12% of consolidated revenue, respectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We may be adversely affected by the loss of, or reduced, delayed or canceled purchases by, one or more of our key customers. 
 Competition 
 We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives used in the enterprise, edge compute/client compute and edge non-compute/client non-compute applications and with other companies in the data storage industry that provide SSDs and NVMe add-in technology. Some of the principal factors used by customers to differentiate among data storage solutions manufacturers are storage capacity, product performance, product quality and reliability, price per unit and price per gigabyte, storage/retrieval access times, data transfer rates, form factor, product warranty and support capabilities, supply continuity and flexibility, power consumption, total cost of ownership, and brand. While different markets and customers place varying levels of emphasis on these factors, we believe that our products are competitive with respect to many of these factors in the markets that we currently address. 
 Principal Competitors. We compete with manufacturers of storage solutions and the principal manufactures in the data storage solution industry include: 
 

 | Seagate, selling the Seagate, LaCie and Maxtor brands;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | Micron Technology, Inc.;
--+-------------------------

 
Seagate Technology public limited company | 2018 Form 10-K | 9 


 
 | Samsung Electronics;
--+---------------------


 | SK Hynix, Inc.;
--+----------------


 | Toshiba Corporation; and
--+-------------------------


 | Western Digital Corporation, operating the Western Digital and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies subsidiaries and SanDisk.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Price Erosion. Historically, our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity, performance and feature sets (like-for-like products). Price declines for like-for-like products (price erosion) tend to be more pronounced during periods of: 
 

 | economic contraction in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | industry supply exceeding demand.
--+----------------------------------

 Disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity, better performance and additional feature sets and product cost reductions. 
 We believe the HDD industry experienced modest price erosion in fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. 
 Product Life Cycles and Changing Technology. Success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to balance the introduction and transition of new products with time-to-volume, performance, capacity and quality metrics at a competitive price, level of service and support that our customers expect. Generally, the drive manufacturer that introduces a new product first benefits from improved product mix, favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced. Changing technology also necessitates on-going investments in research and development, which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines. Further, there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions, as factors such as quality, reliability and manufacturing yields continue to be of significant competitive importance. 
 Seasonality 
 The disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year. This seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back-to-school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter. Beyond traditional seasonality, variability of sales can be related to IT spending or a reflection of more cyclical demand from CSPs based on the timing of procurement, deployment and market supply and demand balance of other components such as NAND and DRAM. 
Research and Development 
 We are committed to developing new component technologies, products and alternative storage technologies. Our research and development focus is designed to bring new products to market in high volume, with quality attributes that our customers expect, before our competitors. Part of our product development strategy is to leverage a design platform and/or subsystem within product families to serve different market needs. This platform strategy allows for more efficient resource utilization, leverages best design practices, reduces exposure to changes in demand, and allows for achievement of lower costs through purchasing economies. Our advanced technology integration effort focuses disk drive and component research on recording subsystems, including read/write heads and recording media; market-specific product technology; and technology focused towards new business opportunities. The primary purpose of our advanced technology integration effort is to ensure timely availability of mature component technologies for our product development teams as well as to allow us to leverage and coordinate those technologies in the design centers across our products in order to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, we had product development expenses of approximately $1,026 million, $1,232 million and $1,237 million, respectively, which represented 9%, 11% and 11% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. 
 
Seagate Technology public limited company | 2018 Form 10-K | 10 


 Patents and Licenses 
 As of June 29, 2018, we had approximately 6,000 U.S. patents and 1,400 patents issued in various foreign jurisdictions as well as approximately 1,000 U.S. and 600 foreign patent applications pending. The number of patents and patent applications will vary at any given time as part of our ongoing patent portfolio management activity. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the data storage industry, we believe that, in addition to patent protection, the improvement of existing products, reliance upon trade secrets, protection of unpatented proprietary know-how and development of new products are also important to our business in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. Accordingly, we intend to continue our efforts to broadly protect our intellectual property, including obtaining patents, where available, in connection with our research and development program. 
 The data storage industry is characterized by significant litigation arising from time to time relating to patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we receive claims that our products infringe patents of third parties. Although we have been able to resolve some of those claims or potential claims without a material adverse effect on us, other claims have resulted in adverse decisions or settlements. In addition, other claims are pending, which if resolved unfavorably to us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For more information on these claims, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataNote 14. Legal, Environmental and Other Contingencies. The costs of engaging in intellectual property litigation in the past have been, and in the future may be, substantial, irrespective of the merits of the claim or the outcome. 
 Backlog 
 In view of industry practice, whereby customers may cancel or defer orders with little or no penalty, we believe backlog for our business is of limited indicative value in estimating future performance and results.
Environmental Matters 
 Our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. 
 We have established environmental management systems and continually update environmental policies and standard operating procedures for our operations worldwide. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits. We budget for operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws. If additional or more stringent requirements are imposed on us in the future, we could incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures. 
 Some environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (as amended, the Superfund law) and its state equivalents, can impose liability for the cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former site owners or operators or upon parties who sent waste to these sites, regardless of whether the owner or operator owned the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. We have been identified as a responsible or potentially responsible party at several sites. At each of these sites, we have an assigned portion of the financial liability based on the type and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable parties. We have fulfilled our responsibilities at some of these sites and remain involved in only a few at this time. 
 While our ultimate costs in connection with these sites are difficult to predict, based on current estimates of cleanup costs and our expected allocation of these costs, we do not expect costs in connection with these sites to be material. 
 We may be subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. For example, the European Union (EU) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, which prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in certain products, including disk drives and server storage products,
