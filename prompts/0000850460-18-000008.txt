General
Encore Wire Corporation is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1989, with its principal executive office and manufacturing plants located at 1329 Millwood Road, McKinney, Texas 75069. The Company’s telephone number is (972) 562-9473. As used in this annual report, unless otherwise required by the context, the terms “we,” “our,” “Company,” “Encore” and “Encore Wire” refer to Encore Wire Corporation and its consolidated entities.
Encore believes it is a low-cost manufacturer of electrical building wire and cable. The Company is a significant supplier of building wire for interior electrical wiring in commercial and industrial buildings, homes, apartments, and manufactured housing.
The principal customers for Encore’s wire are wholesale electrical distributors, who sell building wire and a variety of other products to electrical contractors. The Company sells its products primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives located throughout the United States and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct in-house marketing efforts.
Strategy
Encore’s strategy is to further expand its share of the building wire market primarily by emphasizing a high level of customer service and the addition of new products that complement its current product line, while maintaining and enhancing its low-cost production capabilities. Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design incorporating highly automated manufacturing equipment, an integrated production process and a highly-motivated work force.
Customer Service: Encore is highly focused on responding to customer needs, with an emphasis on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. Encore seeks to establish customer loyalty by achieving a high order fill rate and rapidly handling customer orders, shipments, inquiries and returns. The Company maintains product inventories sufficient to meet anticipated customer demand and believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills orders are key competitive advantages critical to marketing its products.
Product Innovation: Encore has been a leader in bringing new ideas to a commodity product. Encore pioneered the widespread use of color feeder sizes of commercial wire and colors in residential non-metallic cable. The colors have improved on-the-job safety, reduced installation times for contractors and enabled building inspectors to rapidly and accurately inspect construction projects. Encore Wire’s patented SmartColor ID® system for metal-clad and armor-clad cables allows for quick and accurate identification of gauge, number of conductors, wire and jacket type. Additionally, Encore currently has multiple patents and patent-pending innovations that range from process improvements to packaging solutions.
Low-Cost Production: Encore’s low-cost production capability features an efficient plant design and an incentivized work force.
Efficient Plant Design: Encore’s highly automated wire manufacturing equipment is integrated in an efficient design that reduces material handling, labor and in-process inventory.
Incentivized Work Force: The Company has a stock option plan and a stock appreciation rights plan that enhance the motivation of its salaried manufacturing supervisors. The Company also has a comprehensive safety program that emphasizes employee participation. The Company provides a 401(k) retirement savings plan to all employees.
Products
Encore offers an electrical building wire product line that consists primarily of NM-B cable, UF-B cable, THHN/THWN-2, XHHW-2, RHH/RHW-2 and other types of wire products, including tray cable, metal-clad and armored cable. All of these products are manufactured with copper or aluminum as the current carrying component of the conductor. The principal bases for differentiation among stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) are product type, conductor type, diameter, insulation, length, color and packaging.
Manufacturing
The efficiency of Encore’s highly automated manufacturing facility is a key element of its low-cost production capability. Encore’s wire manufacturing lines have been integrated so that the handling of product is substantially reduced throughout the production process. The manufacturing process for the Company’s various products involves multiple steps, including: casting, drawing, stranding, compounding, insulating, cabling, jacketing and armoring.

Encore manufactures and tests all of its products in accordance with the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) standards, a nationally recognized testing and standards agency. Additionally, UL representatives routinely visit and test products from each area of manufacturing. 
Customers
Encore sells its wire to wholesale electrical distributors throughout the United States. Most distributors supply products to electrical contractors. Encore’s customers are numerous and diversified. Encore has two customers, each of whom slightly exceed 10% of the Company's total sales. Encore has no customer, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Encore believes that the speed and completeness with which it fills customers’ orders is crucial to its ability to expand the market share for its products. The Company also believes that, for a variety of reasons, many customers strive to maintain lean inventories. Because of this trend, the Company seeks to maintain sufficient inventories to satisfy customers’ prompt delivery requirements.
Marketing and Distribution
Encore markets its products throughout the United States primarily through independent manufacturers’ representatives and, to a lesser extent, through its own direct marketing efforts.
Encore maintains the majority of its finished product inventory at its plant in McKinney, Texas. In order to provide flexibility in handling customer requests for immediate delivery, additional product inventories are maintained at warehouses owned and operated by independent manufacturers’ representatives located strategically across the country. Some of these manufacturers’ representatives, as well as the Company’s other manufacturers’ representatives, maintain offices without warehouses in numerous locations throughout the United States.
Finished goods are typically delivered to warehouses and customers by trucks operated by common carriers. The decision regarding the carrier to be used is based primarily on availability and cost.
The Company invoices its customers directly for products purchased and, if an order has been obtained through a manufacturer’s representative, pays the representative a commission based on pre-established rates. The Company determines customer credit limits. The Company recorded no bad debt charges in 2017, 2016, and 2015. The manufacturers’ representatives have no discretion to determine prices charged for the Company’s products, and all sales are subject to Company approval. 
Employees
Encore believes that its hourly employees are highly motivated and that their motivation contributes significantly to the Encore’s efficient operation. The Company believes that competitive hourly compensation coupled with sound management practices focuses its employees on maintaining high production standards and product quality.
As of December 31, 2017, Encore had 1,235 employees, 1,028 of whom were paid hourly wages and were primarily engaged in the operation and maintenance of the Company’s manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The Company’s remaining employees were executive, supervisory, administrative, sales and clerical personnel. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company has no collective bargaining agreements with any of its employees.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used by Encore in manufacturing its products are copper cathode, copper scrap, PVC thermoplastic compounds, XLPE compounds, aluminum, steel, paper and nylon, all of which are readily available from a number of suppliers. Copper is the principal raw material used by the Company in manufacturing its products, constituting 80.6% of the dollar value of all raw materials used by the Company during 2017. Copper requirements are purchased primarily from miners and commodity brokers at prices determined each month primarily based on the average daily COMEX closing prices for copper for that month, plus a negotiated premium. The Company also purchases raw materials necessary to manufacture various PVC thermoplastic compounds. These raw materials include PVC resin, clay and plasticizer.
The Company produces copper rod from purchased copper cathode and copper scrap in its own rod fabrication facility. The Company reprocesses copper scrap generated by its operations as well as copper scrap purchased from others. In 2017, the Company’s copper rod fabrication facility manufactured the majority of the Company’s copper rod requirements. The Company purchases aluminum rod from various suppliers for aluminum wire production.
The Company also compounds its own wire jacket and insulation compounds. The process involves the mixture of PVC raw material components to produce the PVC used to insulate the Company’s wire and cable products. The raw materials include PVC

resin, clay and plasticizer. During the last year, the Company’s plastic compounding facility produced virtually all of the Company’s PVC requirements.
Competition
The electrical wire and cable industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with several companies who manufacture and sell wire and cable products beyond the building wire segment in which the Company competes. The Company’s primary competitors include Southwire Company, Cerro Wire LLC, General Cable Corporation and AFC Cable Systems, Inc.
The principal elements of competition in the electrical wire and cable industry are, in the Company's opinion, order fill rate, quality, pricing, and, in some instances, breadth of product line. The Company believes that it is competitive with respect to all of these factors.
Competition in the electrical wire and cable industry, although intense, has been primarily from U.S. manufacturers, including foreign-owned facilities located in the United States. The Company has not encountered significant competition from imports of building wire. The Company believes this is primarily because direct labor costs generally account for a relatively small percentage of the cost of goods sold for these products and freight costs are relatively high to bring wire to the United States from overseas.
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations governing the Company’s operations and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances currently or formerly used by the Company. Management believes the Company is in compliance with all such rules including permitting and reporting requirements. Historically, compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material impact on the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. 
Research and Development Activities
The Company classifies research and development activities as a component of production overhead. Costs attributable to Company-sponsored research and development activities were approximately $1.9 million, $2.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Intellectual Property Matters
From time to time, the Company files patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company currently owns several patents and pending patent applications. The Company also owns several registered trademarks and pending trademark applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The current registrations for the marks will expire on various dates between 2018 and 2023, but each registration can be renewed indefinitely as long as the respective mark continues to be used in commerce and the requisite proof of continued use or renewal application, as applicable, is filed. These trademarks provide source identification for the goods manufactured and sold by the Company and allow the Company to achieve brand recognition within the industry.
