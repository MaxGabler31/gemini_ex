ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Meredith Corporation has been committed to service journalism since its inception in 1902 as an agricultural publisher. In 1924, the Company published the first issue of Better Homes & Gardens. The Company entered the television broadcasting business in 1948. On January 31, 2018, Meredith completed its acquisition of Time Inc. (Time), which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith.
Meredith uses multiple media platforms—including print, digital, mobile, video, and broadcast television—to provide consumers with content they desire and to deliver the messages of our advertising and marketing partners. Nationally, Meredith serves over 180 million unduplicated American consumers and has a readership of 107 million, paid circulation of more than 40 million, and over 150 million monthly unique visitors. Meredith’s broadcast television stations reach 11 percent of United States (U.S.) households.
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MDP.
The Company operates two business segments: national media and local media. Our national media segment includes leading national consumer media brands delivered via multiple media platforms including print magazines, digital and mobile media, brand licensing activities, database-related activities, affinity marketing, and business-to-business marketing products and services. Our focus is on the entertainment, food, lifestyle, parenting, and home categories, which include titles such as People, Better Homes & Gardens, InStyle, Allrecipes, Real Simple, Southern Living, and Martha Stewart Living among others. In addition to subscription magazines, in fiscal 2019 we published over 300 special interest publications. Most of our brands are also available as digital editions on one or more of the major digital newsstands and on major tablet devices. The national media segment’s extensive digital presence consists of more than 60 websites and applications (apps). The national media segment also includes brand licensing activities, affinity marketing, third-party marketing, a large consumer database, and other related operations.
Our local media segment consists of 17 television stations located across the U.S. concentrated in fast growing markets with related digital and mobile media assets. The television stations include seven CBS affiliates, five FOX affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, one NBC affiliate, one ABC affiliate, and two independent stations. Local media’s digital presence includes 12 websites, 12 mobile-optimized websites, and approximately 30 apps focused on news, sports, and weather-related information. In addition, the local media segment sells geographic and demographic-targeted advertising programs to third parties.
Financial information about industry segments can be found in Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Note 18.
The Company’s largest revenue source is advertising. National and local economic conditions affect the magnitude of our advertising revenues. Both national media and local media revenues and operating results can be affected by changes in the demand for advertising and consumer demand for our products. Magazine circulation revenues are generally affected by national and regional economic conditions and competition from other forms of media.

Television advertising is seasonal and cyclical to some extent, traditionally generating higher revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters and during key political contests and major sporting events.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
In July 2017, we sold a 70 percent interest in Charleston Tennis LLC, which operates the Family Circle Tennis Center. In September 2018, the Company sold its remaining 30 percent interest in Charleston Tennis LLC.
In July 2018, Real Simple launched the Real Simple Shop, an online shopping site that builds on the brand's digital and licensing momentum. The Real Simple Shop is an e-commerce destination where consumers can purchase a range of Real Simple branded products, in addition to hundreds of curated items for every aspect of the home life-decorating, cleaning and organizing, cooking, skincare and fashion, and more. Additionally, the shop is filled with expert buying guides to help readers make the best buying decisions possible.
In September 2018, the Company announced plans to merge Cooking Light magazine with EatingWell to create the largest high-frequency subscription magazine in the epicurean category under the EatingWell brand. The new and enhanced EatingWell launched with the January/February 2019 issue with a circulation rate base of 1.775 million.
On October 31, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the TIME media brand and on December 21, 2018, the Company closed on the sale of the Fortune media brand. As part of these transactions, Meredith provided short-term business continuity services to the buyers and entered into multi-year agreements to provide services such as consumer marketing, subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing, and printing.
On February 28, 2019, Meredith acquired 100 percent of the membership interests in Linfield Media, LLC, a marketing business focused on online savings and deals.
In March 2019, Meredith was a key partner in the launch of Apple News+, a new digital subscription service that offers 30 Meredith magazines among more than 300 popular titles, leading newspapers, and digital publishers.
In May 2019, the Company completed the first step of a two-step transaction to sell our Sports Illustrated (SI) business. At the time of the first closing, we transferred title to the SI brand. Simultaneously, we entered into an agreement to license back rights under the SI brand to continue publishing activities associated with SI. The second step of the transaction to complete the sale of the SI brand is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.
During fiscal 2019, Meredith debuted redesigns of several of our subscription magazines. The September 2018 issue of Family Circle featured a new logo, updated cover design, photography that captures real life, and a new content structure. The January/February 2019 issue of Health Magazine marked the debut of an updated design with a cleaner look and bolder typography.
Meredith and Fear Free, LLC, a veterinary, pet professional, and pet owner education company, have come together to introduce Happy Paws magazine, a guide to your dog and cat's best life. The first issue debuted in April 2019.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
National Media
National media contributed 73 percent of Meredith’s consolidated revenues and 31 percent of the combined
operating profit from national media and local media operations in fiscal 2019. Better Homes & Gardens and People, our flagship brands, together account for a significant percentage of revenues and operating profit of the national media segment and the Company.

n/a | Not applicable as The Magnolia Journal does not have a Meredith-owned related website. 
 | Rate base is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers. Actual circulation generally exceeds rate base and for most of the Company’s titles, is tracked by the Alliance for Audited Media, which issues periodic statements for audited magazines.
 | In June 2019, the Company announced that Entertainment Weekly will transition to a monthly magazine. The magazine will continue to produce special interest magazines to coincide with big entertainment industry moments. 

In addition to these major magazine titles, we published over 300 special interest publications under approximately 80 brands in fiscal 2019. The titles are issued from one to six times annually and sold primarily on newsstands. A limited number of special interest publication subscriptions are also sold.
Magazine Advertising—Advertising revenues are generated primarily from sales to clients engaged in consumer marketing. Many of Meredith’s larger magazines offer regional and demographic editions that contain similar editorial content but allow advertisers to customize messages to specific markets or audiences. The Company sells two primary types of magazine advertising: display and direct-response. Advertisements are either run-of-press (printed along with the editorial portions of the magazine) or inserts (preprinted pages). Most of the national media segment’s advertising revenues are derived from run-of-press display advertising. Meredith also possesses strategic marketing capabilities, which provide clients and their agencies with access to all of Meredith’s media platforms and capabilities, including print, television, digital, video, mobile, consumer events, and custom marketing. Our team of creative and marketing experts delivers innovative solutions across multiple media channels that meet each client’s unique advertising and promotional requirements.

The rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine’s rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers. We sell digital advertising primarily on a flat rate/sponsorship basis or on a cost per thousand, or CPM, basis. Flat rate/sponsorship deals are sold on an exclusive basis to advertisers giving them access to our major events. CPM deals are sold on an impression basis with a guarantee that we will deliver the negotiated volume commitment. If we are not able to meet the impression goal, we will extend the campaign or provide alternative placements.
Magazine Circulation—Most of our U.S. magazines are sold primarily by subscription and delivered to subscribers through the mail. Subscriptions obtained through direct-mail solicitation, agencies, insert cards, the internet, and other means are Meredith’s largest source of circulation revenues. Revenue per subscription and related expenses can vary significantly by source. The majority of subscription magazines are also sold by single copy. Single copies sold on newsstands are distributed primarily through magazine wholesalers, who have the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to them by retailers.
Newsstand sales include sales through traditional newsstands as well as supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies and other retail outlets. We also publish branded books, including soft-cover “bookazines.” These are distributed through magazine-style “check-out pockets” at retail outlets and traditional trade book channels. We publish books on a diverse range of topics aligned with our brands, including special commemorative and biographical books. We also publish books under various licensed third-party brands and a number of original titles. Our Oxmoor House imprint publishes a variety of home, cooking, and health books under our lifestyle-oriented brands as well as licensed third-party brands.
Digital and Mobile Media
We have 31 of our titles available as digital editions, with an audience of approximately 1.85 million. Digital subscriptions and single copy sales collectively represent 4.5 percent of our total rate base.
National media’s more than 60 websites provide ideas and inspiration. These branded websites focus on the topics that women care about most—celebrity, entertainment, food, home, entertaining, and meeting the needs of moms—and on delivering powerful content geared toward lifestyle topics such as health, beauty, style, and wellness. Our Allrecipes brand has 3 omni-channel sites serving 4 countries in 2 languages, one app across multiple platforms, and one Skill for Amazon Alexa. Fiscal 2019 digital traffic across our various platforms averaged more than 150 million unique monthly visitors. Our brands have a strong social networking presence as well. In fiscal 2019, national media reached 94 million Facebook fans, 55 million Twitter followers, 40 million Instagram followers, over 12 million Pinterest followers, and nearly 8 million YouTube subscribers.
Other Sources of Revenues
Other revenues are derived from digital and customer relationship marketing, other custom publishing projects, brand licensing agreements, and ancillary products and services.
Affinity Marketing—Synapse Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith, is an affinity marketing company that partners with publishers, brick and mortar retailers, digital partners, airline frequent flier programs, and customer service and direct response call centers. It is a major marketer of magazine subscriptions in the U.S. Building on its continuity marketing expertise, Synapse has diversified its business to also market other products and services. For example, Synapse manages several branded continuity membership programs and is developing continuity programs for product partners.
Brand Licensing—Meredith Brand Licensing generates revenue through multiple long-term trademark licensing agreements with retailers, manufacturers, publishers, and service providers. Our licensing programs extend the reach of Meredith brands into additional consumer channels in the U.S. and abroad. Currently the world’s second largest global licensor, Meredith has direct-to-retail partnerships with leading companies including Better Homes & 
 4

Gardens at Walmart, Southern Living at Dillard’s, Real Simple at Bed Bath & Beyond and TJ Maxx, and InStyle-branded hair salons at more than 275 JC Penney stores.
Our largest partnership is Better Homes & Gardens-branded products sold at Walmart stores in the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The brand is represented by more than 3,000 products across multiple categories in the home décor, outdoor living, and garden space. Meredith also has a long-term agreement to license the Better Homes & Gardens brand to Realogy Corporation, which is entering its 11th year as a residential real estate franchise system operating as Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, LLC. The real estate network now includes more than 350 offices and more than 12,000 real estate professionals across the U.S., Canada, Bahamas, Jamaica, and Australia. Also, in the real estate sector, the Southern Living and Coastal Living brands include networks for 23 Hotel Collection members, 20 inspired residential communities, and more than 45 interior design professionals.
The EatingWell branded line of healthy frozen foods entrées manufactured and distributed by Bellisio Foods Inc. includes up to 12 frozen entrées and 2 breakfast items to select from at more than 17,000 regional and national grocery locations.
Other licensing agreements include the Southern Living Plant Collection at Home Depot, Lowes, and more than 5,000 independent garden centers; Southern Living and Real Simple with 1800 FLOWERS; plus sunglasses designed for women under the Shape brand through a partnership with FGX International.
The Company expands its international reach primarily through international licensing agreements. Meredith’s national media brands are currently distributed in nearly 80 countries, including a localized presence in more than 30 countries such as Australia, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey in print and digitally. The Company continues to pursue activities that will serve consumers and advertisers while also extending and strengthening the reach and vitality of our brands.
Meredith has licensed exclusive global rights to publish and distribute books based on our consumer-leading brands, including the powerful Better Homes & Gardens imprint, to a book publisher. Meredith creates book content and retains all approval and content rights while the publisher is responsible for book layout and design, printing, sales and marketing, distribution, and inventory management. Meredith receives royalties based on sales subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The Foundry—The Foundry is a creative content studio servicing clients across a broad range of industries. The services include using our content creation expertise to develop content marketing programs across multiple platforms, including native advertising that enable clients to engage new consumers and build long-term relationships with existing customers.
Production and Delivery
Paper, printing, and postage costs accounted for 20 percent of the national media segment’s fiscal 2019 operating expenses. Coated and supercalendered publication paper is the major raw material essential to the national media segment. We directly purchase all the paper for our magazine production and custom publishing business. The Company has contractual agreements with major paper manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for planned publishing requirements. The price of paper is driven by overall market conditions and is therefore difficult to predict. In fiscal 2019, average paper prices increased 10 percent. Paper prices decreased 1 percent in fiscal 2018 and decreased 5 percent in fiscal 2017. Management anticipates slight decreases in paper prices in fiscal 2020.
Meredith has multi-year printing contracts with two major domestic printers for the printing of our magazines. 
Postage is a significant expense of the national media segment. We continually seek the most economical and effective methods for mail delivery, including cost-saving strategies that leverage work-sharing opportunities offered within the postal rate structure. Periodical postage accounts for over 80 percent of Meredith’s postage costs, while other mail items—direct mail, replies, and bills—account for nearly 20 percent. The Governors of the United States Postal Service (USPS) review prices for mailing services annually and adjust postage rates periodically. In 
 5

general, postage rate changes are capped by law at the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The most recent rate change was an increase of approximately 2.5 percent effective January 2019. Except for fiscal 2016, postage prices have risen in each of Meredith’s last five fiscal years. In fiscal 2016, we saw a rare reduction in postage prices due to a roll-back of the temporary 4.3 percent exigent increase implemented in January 2014. While we expect postage prices to again increase in January 2020, an ongoing legislatively mandated review of the existing law by the Postal Regulatory Commission could potentially result in adjustments to the current rate setting regime. The impact of any such change could be effective as early as the first quarter of calendar 2020. Meredith continues to work independently and with others to encourage and help the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases. We cannot, however, predict future changes in the postal rates or the impact they will have on our national media business.
Subscription fulfillment services for Meredith's national media brands are provided by third parties. National magazine newsstand distribution services are also provided by third parties through multi-year agreements.
Competition
Publishing is a highly competitive business. The Company’s magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the internet and many other leisure-time activities. Competition for advertising dollars is based primarily on advertising rates, circulation levels, reader demographics, advertiser results, and sales team effectiveness. Competition for readers is based principally on editorial content, marketing skills, price, and customer service. While competition is strong for established titles, gaining readership for newer magazines and specialty publications is especially competitive.
Local Media
Local media contributed 27 percent of Meredith’s consolidated revenues and 69 percent of the combined operating profit from national media and local media operations in fiscal 2019. Information about the Company’s television stations at June 30, 2019, is as follows:

1 Designated Market Area (DMA) is a registered trademark of, and is defined by, Nielsen Media Research. The national rank is from the 2018-2019 DMA ranking. 
2 Average audience share represents the estimated percentage of households using television tuned to the station in the DMA. The percentages shown reflect the average total day shares (6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.) for the November 2018, February 2019, and May 2019 measurement periods. 

Operations
The principal sources of the local media segment’s revenues are: 1) retransmission of our television signals by cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers; 2) local non-political advertising focusing on the immediate geographic area of the stations; 3) national non-political advertising; 4) political advertising which is cyclical with peaks occurring in our odd numbered fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2017, fiscal 2019) and particularly in our second fiscal quarter of those fiscal years; 5) geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties; and 6) digital advertising on the stations’ websites, mobile-optimized websites, and apps.
 7

The stations sell commercial time to both local/regional and national advertisers. Rates for spot advertising are influenced primarily by the market size, number of media competitors, including in-market broadcasters, and audience ratings and demographics. Generally, the larger a station’s audience in any particular daypart or program, the higher the advertising rates it can command. As supply and demand fluctuate in the market, so do a station’s advertising rates. Most national advertising is sold by independent representative firms while local/regional advertising is sold by the sales staff at each station.
Typically 40 to 50 percent of a market’s television advertising revenue is generated during local newscasts. Stations are continually working to increase the number of newscasts and additionally grow their news ratings which in turn increase advertising revenues.
Meredith’s 16 national network affiliations at our television stations also influence advertising rates. A network affiliation agreement provides a station the exclusive right to broadcast network programming in its local service area. In return, the network has the right to sell most of the commercial advertising aired during network programs and receives programming fees from the station.
Retransmission consent revenue is generated from cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers who pay Meredith for access to our television station signals so that they may retransmit our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. These fees increased in each of the last three fiscal years primarily due to renegotiations of expiring contracts and negotiated rate increases on existing contracts effective during the year.
Programming fees paid to the networks are, in essence, a portion of those retransmission consent fees. Programming fees paid to the networks increased significantly in fiscal 2019 and 2018 due to renegotiations of expired contracts.
Stations sometimes also pay networks for certain programming and services such as marquee sports (professional football, college basketball, and Olympics) and news services. While Meredith’s relations with the networks historically have been very good, the Company can make no assurances they will remain so over time.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high-definition television programming, audio, data, mobile applications, and other types of communication, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards. Most of our stations are broadcasting one or more additional programming streams on their digital channels: two of our markets have MyNetworkTV, nine carry COZI TV, six broadcast the Escape network, three air the Bounce network, and four air the LAFF network.
The costs of television programming are significant. In addition to network fees, there are two principal programming costs for Meredith: locally produced programming, including local news, and purchased syndicated programming. The Company continues to increase our locally produced news and entertainment programming to control content and costs and to attract advertisers. Syndicated programming costs are based largely on demand from stations in the market and can fluctuate significantly.
Local media’s operations also include MNI Targeted Media (MNI). Through MNI, we provide clients with a single point of contact for a range of targeted digital and print advertising programs primarily on a local and regional level. Digital products include programmatic offerings and custom display advertising on local and national websites. Print products include customized geographic and demographic-targeted advertising programs in approximately 35 top U.S. magazines, including our own national media magazines and those of other leading magazine publishers.
Competition
Meredith’s television stations compete directly for advertising dollars and programming in their respective markets with other local television stations, radio stations, and cable/satellite systems. The stations further compete against these media competitors’ and other local and national digital and mobile media properties. Other mass media 
 8

providers, such as newspapers, outdoor, local magazines, direct mail and their related websites and apps, are also competitors. Advertisers compare audience viewership/consumption, market share, audience demographics, and advertising rates, whether local, network, or syndicated, when making advertising decisions.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast television stations, including those licensed to the Company, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which engages in extensive regulation of the broadcasting industry under authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), including authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing broadcasting. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands; determines stations’ locations and operating parameters; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; regulates station employment practices; regulates certain program content, including commercial matters in children’s programming; has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act; and imposes annual fees on stations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, as well as to the FCC’s rules, public notices, and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
Broadcast licenses are granted for eight-year periods. The Communications Act directs the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the station has served the public interest and is in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies. Management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies and knows of no reason why Meredith’s broadcast station licenses will not be renewed.
The FCC has, on occasion, changed the rules related to ownership of media assets, including rules relating to the ownership of one or more television stations in a market. The FCC’s media ownership rules are subject to further review by the FCC, various court appeals, petitions for reconsideration before the FCC, and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.
The Communications Act and the FCC also regulate relationships between television broadcasters and cable, satellite, and telecommunications television providers. Under these provisions, most cable systems must devote a specified portion of their channel capacity to the carriage of the signals of local television stations that elect to exercise this right to mandatory carriage. Alternatively, television stations may elect to restrict cable systems from carrying their signals without their written permission, referred to as retransmission consent. Congress and the FCC have established and implemented generally similar market-specific requirements for mandatory carriage of local television stations by satellite television providers when those providers choose to provide a market’s local television signals. These rules, including related rules on exclusivity, good faith bargaining, and over-the-top carriage are subject to further review by the FCC and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.
The FCC proposed a plan, called the National Broadband Plan, to increase the amount of spectrum available in the U.S. for wireless broadband use. In furtherance of the National Broadband Plan, Congress authorized the FCC to conduct a “reverse auction” for which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation in return for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full service and/or Class A stations. Under the law, the FCC was permitted to hold one reverse auction and a follow-up auction for the newly freed spectrum. The FCC completed both auctions in calendar 2017.
Even if a television licensee did not participate in the reverse auction, the results of the auction could materially impact a station’s operations. The FCC has the authority to force a television station to change channels and/or modify its coverage area to allow the FCC to rededicate certain channels within the television band for wireless broadband use. Following the incentive auction period, the FCC released a list of television stations that must change their facilities as part of this “repacking” process. Several of our stations are among the hundreds of stations selected for repacking of the television band. All of our stations selected for repacking have moved or are expected to move and commence operations on their new channels on or before the FCC’s deadline. The FCC will reimburse us for certain repacking expenses subject to an overall industry cap on the reimbursed expenses of all repacked

television stations and certain other entities. We cannot predict whether we will receive full reimbursement for our repacking expenses or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
In addition to the National Broadband Plan, Congress, certain States, and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of other matters that also could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership transferability, and profitability of the Company’s broadcast stations and affect the ability of the Company to acquire additional stations. In addition to the matters noted above, these could include spectrum usage fees, regulation of political advertising rates, restrictions on the advertising of certain products (such as pharmaceuticals, alcoholic beverages, or gambling), program content restrictions, and ownership rule changes.
Other matters that could potentially affect the Company’s broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry for viewers or advertisers, such as home video recording devices and players, satellite radio and television services, cable television systems, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and internet-delivered video programming services. For example, the FCC approved a proposal to allow the voluntary transition of television broadcasters to ATSC 3.0, known as Next Generation Television. We cannot predict whether or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
Large mass communication transactions have also increased the scrutiny of federal and state antitrust enforcement on the mass communications industry. The Company, along with other major broadcasters, is subject to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2019 restricting the exchange of pacing and other information between stations. In entering the Consent Decree, the Company did not admit liability and was not required to pay any fine or other penalty. We cannot predict whether or how this Consent Decree will ultimately affect the broadcast industry, the Company, or our television stations.
The information provided in this section is not intended to be inclusive of all regulatory provisions currently in effect. Statutory provisions and FCC regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could affect future operations and profitability of the Company’s local media segment. Management cannot predict what regulations or legislation may be adopted, nor can management estimate the effect any such changes would have on the Company’s television broadcasting operations.

We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years and consider relations with our employees to be good.
OTHER
Name recognition and the public image of the Company’s trademarks (e.g., People, Better Homes & Gardens, Parents) and television station call letters are vital to the success of our ongoing operations and to the introduction of new businesses. The Company protects our brands by aggressively defending our trademarks and call letters.
The Company had no material expenses for research and development during the past three fiscal years. Revenues from individual customers and revenues, operating profits, and identifiable assets of foreign operations were not significant. Compliance with federal, state, and local provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and to the protection of the environment had no material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or the Company’s competitive position.
