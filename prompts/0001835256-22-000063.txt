Item 1. Business
The Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc. is the premier scaled producer of luxury wines in North America. We have delighted millions of consumers with authentic, high-quality, approachable wines for over four decades. We champion a curated and comprehensive portfolio of highly acclaimed luxury wines across multiple varietals, appellations, brands and price points. Our portfolio is focused exclusively on the desirable luxury segment, which we define as wines sold for $15 or higher per 750ml bottle.
We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at prices ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of winery brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Migration, Canvasback, Calera, Kosta Browne, Greenwing and Postmark. Our wines have a strong record of achieving critical acclaim, vintage after vintage. Each winery brand boasts its own winemaking team to create distinct experiences for consumers, to ensure product quality and continuity and to galvanize sustainable farming practices. Beyond our winemaking teams is an organization comprised of passionate, talented employees, including a highly tenured executive team that has approximately 100 years of cumulative experience with Duckhorn.
We sell our wines in our wholesale channel, to distributors and directly to retail accounts in California, and to consumers in our DTC channel, all of which leverage long-standing relationships developed over the past forty years and provide relatively comparable, attractive margins. Our comprehensive sales force builds deep and impactful relationships with distributors and direct to trade accounts (which we previously referred to as direct to retail) in our wholesale channel. In addition, our DTC channel leverages our multi-winery e-commerce website, and it features our award-winning subscription wine clubs and tasting rooms.
Combined, our California direct to trade accounts business and DTC channel made up 33.7% and 34.7% of our net sales in Fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, delivering greater connectivity with consumers and retailers alike. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1201 Dowdell Lane, St. Helena, California 94574, and our telephone number is (707) 302-2658. We completed our IPO in March 2021, and our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “NAPA.” Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “The Duckhorn Portfolio,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” used herein refer to The Duckhorn Portfolio, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Financial highlights
For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we delivered the following:
•$35.9 million increase in net sales, to $372.5 million.
•$4.2 million increase in net income, to $60.2 million. 
•$10.3 million increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $127.6 million.

Industry background
Our target market 
A majority of our wine is sold in the growing U.S. market. The United States consumes more wine than any other nation and we expect its global wine market share to continue to increase. According to data from Statista capturing on-premise and off-premise sales, the total sales value of wine in the United States was more than $78 billion in 2021. While the COVID-19 pandemic initially adversely impacted on-premise sales, including in bars 
Table of Contents

and restaurants, we have seen the channel rebound to pre-pandemic levels. As a result, the total sales value of wine in the United States is expected to remain relatively resilient to any future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe favorable trends will continue and that wine will take further alcohol beverage market share in the United States, led by established brands with diversified portfolio offerings. 
Luxury wine and premiumization 
American Millennials and Generation X adults have come of age in a culture where cooking shows, celebrity chefs, farmers’ markets and food blogs are the norm. U.S. consumers have had an increasing hunger and thirst for high-quality food and drinks and are willing to pay more for items perceived to be superior. Wine continues to benefit from this premiumization trend. We believe that Millennial wine buyers are often spending more per bottle than any other generation and that as their careers progress and incomes grow, both Millennials and Generation X wine enthusiasts are poised to spend more on wines, particularly those from experiential brands with authentic heritages. 
As of July 2022, the luxury wine segment has increased its share of the overall wine market by 5.0%, since December 2019, according to IRI. We have consistently increased our market share in the growing luxury wine segment, before, during, and as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we believe premiumization will continue to benefit our business as consumers seek trusted brands. According to IRI, the U.S luxury wine segment sales grew at 3.5% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. 
Luxury producer fragmentation and distributor consolidation 
As the luxury wine segment is highly fragmented, we have the advantage of being one of only a few luxury wine producers of scale. Our brands compete for consumers with a wide range of competitors, from the vast number of small volume local wineries, to divisions of large conglomerates. The substantial consolidation of distributors has been driven primarily by mergers and acquisitions, and we expect this trend to continue. 
In this environment of distributor consolidation and a fragmented universe of many subscale luxury producers, we believe our position as a scaled luxury producer is highly appealing to large distributors and retailers and that our comprehensive portfolio offering provides a “one-stop shop” solution for all their luxury wine needs. 
Key drivers of our continued success 
We attribute our success to the following strengths: 
Curated and comprehensive portfolio of luxury wines. Our portfolio encompasses ten luxury brands that champion 15 varietals in 31 AVA designations. Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy and Kosta Browne are the cornerstones of this curated and comprehensive portfolio and reinforce the credibility and brand strength of our entire portfolio. We believe the breadth and depth of our luxury brands, coupled with our scale, position us as a premier supplier of luxury wines. Our singular focus on sustainable luxury winemaking energizes our employees, fosters trust and credibility in our customer and grower relationships, and ultimately results in high-quality, award-winning wines that we believe deeply resonate with consumers. 
Our portfolio breadth and depth also allow us to offer tiered pricing within the luxury wine segment, enabling us to attract new consumers with affordable wines and deepen our relationship with them as they seek more premium offerings. The Decoy brand provides high-quality wines at accessible prices, often serving as the customer gateway into our luxury wine offerings across our broader portfolio. Duckhorn Vineyards, Kosta Browne and our other winery brands provide the consumer an opportunity to both elevate and broaden their experience with the wines in our diverse luxury portfolio. While we are unable to predict future shifts in consumer demand, we believe our curated and comprehensive portfolio is well-positioned to meet the needs of distributors, our accounts and consumers. 
Exceptional brand strength and critical acclaim. The Duckhorn Portfolio has consistently received stellar reviews across varietals, geographies and price points from the industry’s top critics and publications. Two of our 
Table of Contents

wines, the Kosta Browne Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir and the Duckhorn Vineyards Napa Valley Three Palms Vineyard Merlot, have received one of the industry’s most prestigious awards, Wine Spectator magazine’s Wine of the Year. We are the only wine company to have more than one winery brand in our portfolio to have received this award in the 21st century. Critics within our industry widely use a 100-point scale to score individual wines, and we take pride in our consistent track record of 90+ point wines, scores that indicate superior quality. The strength of our winery brands is also demonstrated by our market-leading sales in some of the most popular varietals in the U.S. luxury market. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we had the top selling domestic luxury wine for Cabernet Sauvignon (the largest luxury varietal during the period), Sauvignon Blanc (the fastest growing luxury top wine varietal during the period) and Merlot, according to IRI. These three varietals combined represented approximately 41% of the total U.S. luxury wine market during the same period.
Scaled luxury platform. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine company in the United States. We believe our approach and dedicated focus on luxury wines continues to be highly appealing to the modern wine consumer seeking authenticity and enables category excellence versus our more broadly focused, scaled competitors. We also have an advantage over our fragmented, smaller-scale competitors because our individual brands each benefit from their place in our larger portfolio, leveraging more efficient operational, branding, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, our depth of operational capabilities enables us to simultaneously present a curated offering of the most popular wine varietals and prudently develop new offerings in new, high-growth categories, all with the credentials of a pure-play luxury producer of scale. 
Our large, highly knowledgeable sales force is a key advantage of our scale relative to small luxury producers. We deploy our sales force in the wholesale channel to evangelize our portfolio to our vast network of distributors and retail accounts. Understanding how consumers will connect with winery brands is critical to gaining shelf and menu space, and while smaller luxury wine brands rely on distributors to introduce and promote brands, our sales force takes direct action to strengthen our account relationships. As a credentialed luxury supplier of choice, we expect to benefit from further enhanced distributor prioritization due to sell-through confidence and operational efficiency. 
Differentiated omni-channel sales and distribution platform. Our innovative, scalable platform enables us to fulfill consumer needs through an integrated experience across channels at attractive gross profit and adjusted EBITDA margins. Our ideal consumers interact with us seamlessly across channels, through our wine clubs and tasting rooms and when grocery shopping or ordering at a restaurant. 
We leverage our long-standing wholesale channel nationwide (with approximately 59,000 accounts domestically), including our direct to trade accounts business in California (with approximately 3,000 accounts in Fiscal 2022), to build deep, impactful relationships with our trade accounts. These channels provide a critical path for our winery brands to succeed both on-premise and off-premise, across a wide range of outlets and geographies. 
Since our founding more than 40 years ago, we have been selling directly to retail accounts in California, a point of distinction among large California wine producers, many of which sell through a distributor in the state. We believe our direct to trade accounts business in California gives us a competitive advantage for several reasons. First, our direct connection with the retail accounts allows us more control over sales, branding and other marketing support. Second, our approach gives us more visibility into sell-through rates. Finally, we enjoy significantly stronger margins selling directly to retail accounts, rather than selling through a distributor. However, due to selling expense as a percentage of net sales variability, adjusted EBITDA margins are relatively comparable among the various channels. 
Our DTC channel is a powerful marketing engine. This part of our business encompasses our multi-winery e-commerce website, featuring award-winning subscription wine clubs, and is reinforced by our seven stylistically unique and high-touch tasting rooms located throughout Northern California and Washington. Our ultra-luxury wines, which we consider to be wines with suggested retail prices of $25 or higher per 750ml bottle, are prominently featured in this channel, yielding high average bottle prices. Early access to new releases, a 
Table of Contents

compelling slate of member benefits and active cross-marketing throughout the portfolio drive wine club member loyalty and sales. These strategies maximize each winery brand and property while driving awareness for the Company’s other world-class wines and properties, resulting in more and lasting connections with consumers and wholesale customers. 
We believe the strategic combination of our complementary paths to consumers has been an important driver of our sustained growth and will continue to enable long-term scalability, though ultimately the success of our business depends on our ability to develop connections between our customers and our winery brands. We balance the market accessibility of a broad wholesale reach with direct and authentic customer and consumer touchpoints that drive connectivity, insights and trust. Combined, our California direct to trade accounts business and DTC channel make up 33.7% and 34.7% of our combined net sales for Fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
We believe our comprehensive omni-channel route-to-market is a key differentiator of our leading U.S. luxury wine platform and allows us to engage with distributors, customers and consumers on multiple fronts and meet their needs across price points, varietals and appellations, driving long-term sustainable growth. 
Diversified and scalable production model. The success of The Duckhorn Portfolio is underpinned by our strategic, diversified and scalable supply and production platform. We strive for capital efficiency and secure the majority of our grape supply by leveraging long-standing relationships within a vast, geographically diversified network of more than 318 trusted growers and bulk wine suppliers, designed to help us mitigate agricultural risk, optimize costs and quality and flexibly scale. At our eight state-of-the-art wineries, we are able to directly control the quality of the wine we produce. 
To complement this scaled platform, we control (owned or leased) 33 distinct Estate vineyards spanning 1,158 acres. Some of our most prestigious wines are created from Estate grapes grown in these vineyards under our own viticultural heritage utilizing sustainable winegrowing and employing responsible land and water stewardship practices. 
This diversified sourcing model provides many benefits: 
•Luxury credentials. Estate grapes are used primarily in our DTC-only wines to give a sense of place to our iconic winery brand heritage and showcase our award-winning winemaking capabilities. 
•Reliability of supply. We have a long history of creating a portfolio of wines year after year, at scale, that consistently meet the highest standards of quality. Given our industry’s exposure to climate change risks and extreme weather events, we regularly evaluate impacts of climate change on our business and plan to disclose any such impacts to provide transparency with respect to our efforts to effectively manage the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. We are committed to continuing to take measures to achieve climate resiliency and to expand our agile supply chain with highly diversified grape sourcing to help ensure we mitigate the impact of climate change and unforeseen natural events. 
•Rapid scalability. Contracted supply from our trusted grape grower and bulk wine supplier network enables us to react to market trends and grow luxury winery brands, like Decoy, quickly while maintaining quality excellence. 
•Cost management. Our scale provides us with operating leverage, and we believe our strategy both to Estate-grow and contract our grape supply provides us with increased visibility into our cost structure and makes us less susceptible to market volatility. 
Our diversified and scalable production model enables us to efficiently adapt to changing consumer demand, drive toward our environmental sustainability goals and rapidly bring to market diversified case lot sizes. 
Exceptional leadership team. We have an exceptional, culture-driven leadership team at the helm of The Duckhorn Portfolio. The highly tenured executive team has approximately 100 years of cumulative experience with Duckhorn and is led by Alex Ryan, who began his work with luxury wine at Duckhorn over 34 years ago. 
Table of Contents

The executive leadership team is made up of six strategic and functionally focused professionals dedicated to the success and growth of The Duckhorn Portfolio. Since 2010, this leadership team has grown net sales by approximately 600%, successfully managing the business through multiple economic cycles, challenging environmental externalities and the integration of two acquisitions. Supporting this leadership team is a deep bench of highly talented managers, many of whom have a long history at the Company and with our winery brands. Throughout our history, we believe we have been able to attract the highest caliber employees in the winemaking industry because of our reputation, prioritization of sustainability and corporate responsibility, holistic focus on our team members and commitment to developing, empowering, supporting and promoting our employees, which is a core element of our leadership. 
Our strategy for continuous growth 
Our entire organization is growth-oriented. From product innovation and category expansion to expanding points of distribution, every department plays a role in the growth of The Duckhorn Portfolio. We have a long, successful track record of enhancing our growth initiatives and delivering on our commitment to excellence in luxury winemaking. 
Our growth plan relies on core competencies demonstrated by our organization throughout our history. We expect to deliver meaningful increases in stockholder value by continuing to execute the following strategies: 
Leverage our sales and marketing strength to gain market share in a consolidating marketplace. 
We believe our comprehensive sales and marketing plan will continue to increase awareness across our luxury wine portfolio, reinforce the strength of our winery brands and expand our market share. 
Our commitment to excellence has resulted in a track record of industry awards, and we believe these recognitions provide our entire luxury wine portfolio with a halo of prestige. The success of our business relies on our ability to maintain the prestige of our portfolio, and we expect to continue to be honored with critical acclaim and 90+ point wine scores, which we believe will drive consumer engagement and further solidify the reputation of our entire luxury wine portfolio. 
We believe leveraging our sales and marketing strength will increase brand awareness and grow sales for our winery brands to existing consumers and a new generation of consumers. This plan is made possible by our omni-channel sales platform, which enables us to grow, both through volume increases and through periodic price increases, particularly on our higher-end, smaller lot DTC wines. 
We also plan to continue to invest in our wholesale channel sales force to expand our network of distributor and account advocates and grow our retail presence. We expect this differentiated platform advantage will continue to increase our brand awareness and presence in the fragmented luxury wine segment. 
Establishing and maintaining the awareness of The Duckhorn Portfolio as a premier luxury winemaker is paramount to our growth and success, and we believe our sales and marketing strength will reinforce this and enable us to gain market share in a consolidating marketplace. Additionally, we are steadfast in our desire to be an industry leader in ESG practices, as we have long believed that investing in sustainable business practices complements our business success in the luxury wine market. 
Insightful and targeted portfolio evolution. 
We maintain close connectivity to luxury wine consumers through our omni-channel sales model, which coupled with our high-quality, flexible production assets, allows us to thoughtfully tailor our portfolio to meet consumers’ needs. One of our most successful growth initiatives has been the long-term development and evolution of Decoy, which began with a single offering and now includes 13 different labels across our Decoy and Decoy Limited offerings. We expect to further enhance Decoy as a luxury winery brand and we see great potential for further extensions, as evidenced by some of the following recent innovations. In recent years, we successfully launched five new Decoy labels, each of which received strong consumer reception. Four of these labels are in our new 
Table of Contents

upmarket tier, Decoy Limited, which consists of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley Red Blend, Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir and Sonoma Coast Chardonnay. In addition, we inaugurated a new category offering, Decoy Brut Cuvée Sparkling. We expect to launch other Decoy extensions in the future and intend to continue evolving and strategically broadening The Duckhorn Portfolio to drive future growth. 
Our curated and comprehensive portfolio and historical growth result from long-term dedication to continuous evolution and alignment with the luxury wine consumer. As we continue to scale, we believe our growth mindset, coupled with our differentiated production and distribution platform, will enable us to continue to adapt and remain at the forefront of our industry. 
Expand and accelerate wholesale channel distribution.
We see an opportunity to continue to expand our retail accounts and increase cases sold per retail account, most prominently by leveraging the strength of our powerhouse Decoy brand. In Fiscal 2022, we increased the number of our accounts by 14.0% to approximately 59,000. Over the same period, our domestic case sales per account decreased by 1.2% and our number of distribution points increased by approximately 8%. While the wholesale channel has experienced significant distributor consolidation and increased competition in recent years, we believe our long-standing existing commercial relationships coupled with exceptional portfolio strength, built over the last four decades, position us to capture this distribution growth opportunity and accelerate sales to existing distributors and retail accounts in California. 
Continue to invest in DTC capabilities.
We plan to continue to invest in our DTC channel, which currently comprises approximately 16% of sales and features seven tasting rooms, multiple wine clubs and a robust online portfolio experience. This robust channel provides an important means for us to engage with consumers, create brand evangelists and drive adoption across our portfolio. This channel also favorably impacts gross profit margins, as wines sold through our DTC programs are often more exclusive, higher-priced wines. However, due to selling expense as a percentage of net sales variability, adjusted EBITDA margins are relatively comparable among the various channels. We believe the growth of our DTC channel is a meaningful testament to our wines and their appeal to American luxury wine consumers. Our DTC channel will continue to play a critical role in authenticating our luxury credentials with consumers, and we believe our scaled presence and expertise in the channel separates us from our competitors. 
Evaluate strategic acquisitions opportunistically.
As part of our ongoing growth strategy, we strategically evaluate acquisition opportunities. While our growth and success are not contingent upon future acquisitions, we believe our leadership and operational teams have the capabilities and experience to execute and integrate acquisitions to create stockholder value. We actively track and evaluate acquisition opportunities that could create strategic advantages for our business. 
This approach has led to the successful acquisition of two winery brands over the past four years: Kosta Browne and Calera. Both brands offer highly acclaimed wines with deeply connected consumer followings. In addition to complementing our portfolio, both acquisitions had unique strategic rationale: Kosta Browne expanded our DTC capabilities and Calera further diversified our supply chain and production resilience by broadening our grape-sourcing relationships within the Central Coast of California. These renowned wineries have continued to thrive and grow in prominence under our stewardship. In Fiscal 2022, the Company completed the purchase of four California vineyards of approximately 340 acres, and related assets for a total of $32.7 million. 
Competitive landscape
While there are thousands of companies that supply wines in the United States, sales in the industry are relatively concentrated among a limited number of companies. We target and compete in the luxury price segment, and our off-premise average selling price per bottle over this period was $20.56, the second highest of the top 25 U.S. wine suppliers, as measured by IRI. We estimate that our on-premise average selling price per bottle is typically 
Table of Contents

between two and three times the off-premise average selling price. In the 52-week period ended July 31, 2022, our off-premise sales grew 14.5% year over year, the greatest increase of the top 40 wine suppliers, according to IRI. 
The tail of the United States wine industry is relatively fragmented. The Duckhorn Portfolio sits at the intersection of scale, luxury and growth and we are the only pure-play U.S. luxury wine company of scale. We believe we compete with our competitors, large and small, on price, quality, perceived luxury authenticity, portfolio depth, innovation, product visibility and channel presence. 
Our commitment to environmental, social and governance leadership 
We believe that leadership in the ESG challenges and opportunities we and our industry face is a central element of our Company’s mission because our success is tied to how responsibly and sustainably we run our business. We are focused on taking steps every year to address environmental concerns and climate change, strengthen the support of our employees and the communities in which we live and adhere to best practices in corporate governance and risk assessment and mitigation. In order to drive the most impact, our ESG program focuses on material topics such as sustainable agriculture, water conservation, responsible packaging, diversity and inclusion, human capital management, health and safety, customer privacy, responsible drinking practices, ethical business practices, and data privacy and cybersecurity. We continue to strengthen our ESG program and responsibly manage our business-relevant ESG factors that may impact the long-term interests of our stakeholders. Our annual Sustainability and Responsibility Report provides a discussion of our oversight and management of ESG elements that are material to our business as well as detail on how our operations work towards mitigating climate change.
Our ESG initiative is organized into three pillars, which, in turn, contain focus areas for our attention and action: 
•Environmental. The Environmental pillar is focused on climate change and sustainable winegrowing practices, improved resource utilization and responsible packaging.
•Social. The Social pillar is focused on promoting diversity and inclusion, enhancing community involvement and charitable engagement, reinforcing our holistic commitment to our employees and their safety, maintaining customer data privacy and encouraging the responsible consumption of our wines. 
•Governance. The Governance pillar is focused on upholding our commitment to ethical business conduct, integrity and corporate responsibility, discerning climate-related risks and opportunities, enhancing sustainability reporting within the Company and integrating strong governance and enterprise risk management oversight across all aspects of our business. 
Our ESG initiative is led by our Administration Department, which supports the execution of the initiative’s priorities by stakeholders across all departments in the Company. The Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, as well as our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, provide direction with respect to the evolving priorities of the ESG initiative and receive quarterly reports with respect to the quantitative and qualitative progress of goal attainment. In addition, we report to our stockholders with respect to the results of the ESG initiative on an annual basis, with our next Sustainability and Responsibility Report being published online later this year. 
Farming and winery operations 
We farm and control (owned or leased) 1,158 Estate vineyard acres throughout the premier grape-growing regions in California and Washington. Between 2015 and 2021, our Estate vineyards produced on average more than 10% of the grapes required to meet our wine production needs, while more than 85% of our total production was sourced from third-party growers and, to a lesser extent, the bulk wine market. Due to our ongoing reinvestment in our vineyard infrastructure, the natural lifecycle of grapevines and other business and agricultural considerations, the exact number of acres that are fallow, bearing fruit or producing a specific varietal is in perpetual fluctuation. We currently engage in a number of sustainable winegrowing practices and are working diligently to address climate change vulnerability as part of the Environmental pillar of our ESG initiative. We 
Table of Contents

further our commitment to responsible land stewardship by designing our vineyards to minimize impact on the surrounding environment and utilizing sophisticated farming practices to encourage soil enhancement, erosion control and healthy ecosystems by using native cover crops and water-efficient rootstock. 
To supplement our Estate-grown fruit, we purchase additional grapes from grower partners and, to a significantly lesser extent, bulk wine from trusted producers. We source grapes and bulk wine from more than 318 counterparties, many of whom we have worked with for decades. In addition to grapes and bulk wine, we use additives to support and develop the fermentation, filtration, clarification and stabilization of the wine from tank to bottle. We also use barrels sourced from France, glass bottles from Mexico, cork from Portugal and metal packaging components from the United States and Europe. We are focused on diversifying our supply chain and grape sourcing to be best positioned to respond to unforeseen natural events. 
Quality control is a priority at every stage of wine production at The Duckhorn Portfolio, from harvesting the fruit at the desired brix to storage and transportation of the cased goods at the appropriate temperature. Our wineries leverage state-of-the-art technology designed to ensure optimal quality, allowing our winemaking teams a high level of visibility in reaching the desired results. Much of our wine is produced at an ISO-9001-certified plant. Once wine grapes have been harvested, the fruit is brought via truck from the vineyard to the winery to begin the winemaking process. Most of our winemaking activities occur at one of our eight wineries, under the direction of one of our winemaking teams, who design and implement quality control plans for each stage of the production process. Winemaking activities for some of our wines take place under our direction at custom crush partners. Between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021, approximately 70% of our grape crush mix by net weight was processed at one of our wineries, and the remaining 30% was processed under our direction at custom crush partners. Great care is taken in the grape selection process, particularly with respect to our ultra-luxury wines, to maximize the quality of grape clusters that are used in our wines. Once the winemaking team is satisfied that the grapes are of consistent ripeness and quality, the grapes are destemmed, crushed and later pumped into fermentation tanks. During the fermentation process, the winemaking team continually observes, measures and mixes the juice as the sugars convert to alcohol. Once the fermentation process is complete, the wine is racked into barrels or storage tanks for cellaring. Nearly all of our wines are bottled at one of our facilities, which allows us to nimbly change bottling schedules at our facilities to meet changing demand. Across our facilities, we believe we have sufficient infrastructure, equipment and entitlements to bottle approximately three million gallons of wine per year. Our red wines generally have a harvest-to-release inventory lifecycle that can range from 15 to 48 months. Our white, rosé and sparkling wines generally have a harvest-to-release inventory lifecycle that can range from five to 48 months. 
At the end of bottling, labeled bottles are loaded into cases and placed in storage ready for transit. Wine must be transported by trucks, trailers or rail that are able to maintain the proper temperature to maintain the quality and integrity of the wine. Most wine sold through the DTC channel, unless collected by the customer at a tasting room, is shipped from one of several storage locations via common carrier in compliance with applicable regulations. Wine sold through the wholesale channel in California is transported by carrier to the retail account. Wine sold in the wholesale channel to distributors outside of California and exported internationally is transported by carriers to the distributor or foreign importer that purchased the wine. The distributor or foreign importer stores our wines at staging locations and fulfills orders from on- and off-premise accounts in its respective territory. 
We aim to be a responsible consumer-packaged-goods producer and utilize reusable and recyclable packaging sourced from sustainable producers. As shipping is often the biggest producer of greenhouse gases in the wine supply chain, we have moved toward the use of lighter weight bottles, thereby decreasing our annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of our packaging, including glass bottles, screwcaps, shipping boxes and cork, are recyclable and renewable, further reducing the carbon footprint in our packaging lifecycle.

Our omni-channel sales and distribution platform 
Once our wine is produced, there are two primary, routes for it to reach our consumers: our wholesale channel, which includes direct sales to retail accounts in California and indirect sales through distributors, and our DTC channel, through which we sell directly to our consumers. In the United States, the alcoholic beverage sales regulatory framework generally prohibits alcohol producers from selling alcohol in the wholesale channel directly to retail accounts located outside of the producer’s home state. However, we are able to sell directly to retail accounts in California, as a benefit of our California (Type 02) winegrowers license. 
Our wholesale business outside of California operates as a part of the state government-mandated three-tier system, which establishes three categories of licensees: the producer (the party that makes the wine), the distributor (the party that buys the wine from the producer and, in turn, sells it to the retailer) and the retailer (the party that sells the wine to the ultimate consumer). 
We have an extensive network of salespeople across both our wholesale and DTC channels. We deploy our sales force, which included approximately 106 dedicated sales professionals as of July 31, 2022, in our wholesale channel to evangelize our vast network of distributors and retail accounts. Understanding how consumers will connect with brands is critical in allocating shelf and menu space, and while smaller luxury brands rely on distributors to introduce and promote their brands, our sales force takes direct action to deepen our existing distributor relationships as well as to work directly with retail accounts. In addition, our team of approximately 80 hospitality professionals (including seasonal and on-call employees) serve as ambassadors for our winery brands in our seven tasting rooms. 
The wholesale channel 
We distribute our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries. In some states, an exclusive distributor must be assigned for each brand, and that distributor retains long-term rights to sell the brand in that state. We pride ourselves on our strong relationships with our distributors and structure these relationships within applicable law to maximize continuity and flexibility. We are sensitive to the detrimental effect on consumer buying behavior if a wine is unavailable, and we work closely with distributors to seek to maximize inventory availability. 
In California, our right to sell directly to retail accounts enhances our gross profit margin relative to wine we sell through distributors in other states, and allows us to have greater control of brand messaging and focus within the state. While few scaled producers utilize this route to market, The Duckhorn Portfolio has made use of this approach in California since 1980. In Fiscal 2022, California represented approximately 17% of our wholesale net sales, with approximately 3,000 retail accounts. Additionally, a small percentage of our wines are sold directly to accounts outside of California, including cruise ships, airlines and duty-free shops. 
The DTC channel
Our DTC channel activities encompass seven tasting rooms, several popular and award-winning wine clubs, a robust multi-winery e-commerce website and universal shopping cart, a powerful Kosta Browne member allocation model and high-touch customer service teams. 
One catalyst of the DTC business is by-appointment seated tasting experiences supported by highly trained wine specialists who connect guests with our rarest wines, dynamic people and beautiful properties. The tasting room experience is designed to turn each guest into a brand evangelist and encourage future connections and purchases throughout our portfolio and channels. 
Nearly all winery brands are available on the website via our universal shopping cart so that a consumer who discovers us for one brand or particular label will quickly be exposed to our other winery brands to fulfill their future wine needs. These strategies maximize each brand and property while driving awareness for our other world-class wines and properties, resulting in more and lasting connections with consumers and accounts. DTC is the channel with the highest gross profit margin and a critical marketing engine that creates brand strength and drives sales of our most expensive wines.

Marketing 
Strategy 
Our marketing strategy is centered around our goal of making The Duckhorn Portfolio the producer of choice for luxury wine consumers and accounts. Our marketing activities are organized around three major functional areas: consumer marketing, account marketing and new product development. The consumer marketing activities are focused on increasing awareness and creating engaged consumers through public relations, advertising, rich content creation and social/digital engagement for both our wines and tasting experiences offered in our DTC channel. Our account marketing activities are focused on cultivating strong relationships and success with our top distributors and national chain accounts, including merchandising, promotions and distribution expansion. Our functional marketing approach enables us to effectively leverage and cross-promote our three top selling winery brands: Decoy, Duckhorn Vineyards and Kosta Browne. 
New product development and innovation are core to our marketing strategy. A significant portion of sales are derived from labels developed within the last five years, including Postmark Napa Valley, Decoy Rosé and Duckhorn Vineyards Rutherford Cabernet. We believe the recent additions of a sparkling Decoy Brut Cuvee and a higher-priced Decoy Limited tier are paving the way for Decoy to become a luxury winery brand with both breadth and depth. 
As a globally recognized wine brand, we strive to consistently and responsibly market our products in a legal, safe and compliant manner as part of the Social pillar of our ESG initiative. We promote health and safety by requiring our employees, partners and vendors involved in the promotion of our winery brands to engage in practices and messaging consistent with responsible and safe consumption of our wines. 
Marketing spend 
Our annual marketing spend is divided into three major components: account-focused activities to create unique and dynamic programs; consumer-focused activities to raise winery portfolio awareness, create engagement and ultimately make a sale; and marketing efforts for Kosta Browne. Account spending primarily includes support for national accounts and merchandising materials, support for the burgeoning e-commerce curbside pick-up and grocery delivery services and other advertising. Consumer spending includes public relations, advertising, events (both virtual and in-person), content creation and digital spend on podcast ads and influencer marketing. Given the industry consolidation over the past 20 years, having a strategic focus and budget dedicated to our top customers has yielded strong relationships and results. Kosta Browne marketing predominantly supports the three annual member offers, digital marketing programs and high-touch collateral for member unboxing experiences and events. 
Social media and engagement 
Our social media marketing is designed to employ captivating content to re-create the powerful community-building prowess of our founders online. With over 300,000 followers combined, across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, we increased our followers by approximately 20% over prior year. We surpass many of our wine company competitors and are capitalizing on the current social media consumption trends to drive awareness, engagement, lead generation and sales. Duckhorn Vineyards and Decoy primarily focus on driving awareness and engagement, while Kosta Browne is particularly adept at using “sign-up required” social engagement like the KB Kitchen Series featuring acclaimed top chefs to drive new DTC members. A material portion of the annual marketing budget is spent on influencer marketing, social advertising and social monitoring. These efforts primarily support our Decoy winery brand given its larger audience size. 
Diversity and inclusion, which is one of the focus areas of the Social pillar of our ESG initiative have been foundational elements in our content strategy for many years and can be seen threaded throughout our posts.

Human capital 
Our team, our values
Our values are an integral part of our Company’s success and provide the foundation for continued growth. Our company culture has evolved as we have grown, but it has remained rooted in the shared values that were central to the vision of our founders, who focused on respect, hard work, collaboration, innovation and a commitment to our mission. We are proud that the average tenure of our full-time employees, at approximately four years, meets the 2020 industry average of four years, which we believe is partially a result of programs in our employee enrichment focus area of the Social pillar of our ESG initiative. For example, because many roles at the Company have a physical component, we maintain a comprehensive injury and illness prevention program to enhance employee safety. We believe our company culture is a key competitive advantage and a strong contributor to our success. 
Workforce
As of July 31, 2022, we had approximately 434 full-time employees and 23 part-time and 61 seasonal employees. All of our employees are employed in the United States except for one. We rely on temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily on our farming teams. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Compensation and Benefits; Health and Wellness
Through our comprehensive benefit plans, educational opportunities and recognition programs, we aim to position all of our employees for success in their careers and enable them to lead well-balanced and meaningful lives. Our benefits package is designed to attract, engage, motivate, and retain top talent. We strive to provide compensation, benefits, and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. Our benefits package includes competitive market pay and comprehensive benefits that are among the best in our industry, including insurance to protect and maintain health, income protection through our short- and long-term disability programs, paid parental leave, and services to assist in balancing work and personal life, such as an employee assistance program.
Training and Development
The attraction, development, and retention of employees is a critical success factor for our success. To support the growth and advancement of our employees, we offer tuition reimbursement and an array of training and professional development opportunities, including a mentorship program, professional development reviews and a variety of training workshops.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our culture of diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) enables us to create, develop, and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to meet our growth objectives. In the past year, we launched our D&I initiative, providing an avenue for all employees to share experiences, recognize one another and learn to be more thoughtful in our interactions with fellow employees, customers and partners.
Our D&I efforts focus on building a foundation of respect and integrity among colleagues and recognizing the potential biases and prejudices that may exist in the workplace. To create a customized experience for our employees, our Administration department developed and presented a three-module curriculum (offered in both English and Spanish) that covered topics including unconscious bias, identification of microaggressions and actions and inclusion literacy.

IT systems 
We rely on various IT systems, owned by us and third parties, to effectively manage our sales and marketing, accounting, financial, legal and compliance functions. We have established policies designed to safeguard our systems and data. All of our tasting rooms use a computerized, third-party hosted point of sale system to enroll customers as wine club or offer list members, update member information, process sales transactions, as well as track and analyze sales, membership statistics, member tenure, billing performance and demographic profiles by member. 
Our websites are hosted by third parties, and we rely on third-party vendors for regulatory compliance for order processing, shipments and e-commerce functionality. We believe these systems are scalable to support our growth plans. Our financial, legal, compliance, sales, production and other administrative computer systems are comprised of a variety of technologies designed to assist in the management and analysis of our revenues, costs and key operational metrics, inventory tracking and management, production records, as well as support the daily operations of our Company, some of which are hosted on third-party systems. Additionally, we utilize third parties to track our shipments and depletions and other third parties to supply us with specific retail information regarding our and our competitor’s sales volumes. 
We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of IT in virtually every area of our business. Our IT strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans in the foreseeable future. Consistent with the customer privacy focus area of the Social pillar of our ESG initiative, we also strive to maintain the integrity of customer information. 
We maintain an ongoing comprehensive multi-year program to replace or upgrade key systems, enhance security and optimize their performance. Additionally, we understand the importance of safeguarding our technology systems. We guard our systems through a multilayer technology stack and a strict security protocol intended to aid in the harmonization of our multi-process security systems and solutions. We continuously monitor our systems, 
Table of Contents

regularly conduct third-party security audits and testing of our systems to verify our network’s integrity to protect against the compromise of our systems from both internal and external sources. 
In addition to identifying information security risks, we have put robust controls in place to seek to reduce or mitigate such risks. We further supplement our security processes with required monthly Company-wide security training and testing. 
Regulatory matters 
Regulatory framework
We, along with our contract growers, producers, manufacturers, distributors, retail accounts and ingredients and packaging suppliers, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities with respect to registration, production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution of wine and other products we make. 
We are also subject to state and local tax requirements in all states where our wine is sold. We monitor the requirements of relevant jurisdictions to maintain compliance with all tax liability and reporting matters. In California, we are subject to a number of governmental authorities, and are also subject to city and county building, land use, licensing and other codes and regulations. 
Alcohol-related regulation 
We are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by federal, state and local laws regulating the production, distribution and sale of consumable food items, and specifically alcoholic beverages, including by the TTB and the FDA. The TTB is primarily responsible for overseeing alcohol production records supporting tax obligations, issuing wine labeling guidelines, including grape source and bottle fill requirements, as well as reviewing and issuing certificates of label approval, which are required for the sale of wine through interstate commerce. We carefully monitor compliance with TTB rules and regulations, as well the state law of each state in which we sell our wines. In California, where most of our wines are made, we are subject to alcohol-related licensing and regulations by many authorities, including the Department of Alcohol Beverage Control. Department of Alcohol Beverage Control agents and representatives investigate applications for licenses to sell alcoholic beverages, report on the moral character and fitness of alcohol license applicants and the suitability of premises where sales are to be conducted and enforce California alcoholic beverages laws. We are subject to municipal authorities with respect to aspects of our operations, including applicable land use laws and the terms of our use permits. These regulations, as well as the land use permits to which our properties are subject, limit the production of wine, set restrictions on certain business activities, control the sale of wine and regulate the time, place and manner of hospitality in our tasting rooms, among other elements. 
Employee and occupational safety regulation 
We are subject to certain state and federal employee safety and employment practices regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, and regulations governing prohibited workplace discriminatory practices and conditions, including those regulations relating to COVID-19 virus transmission mitigation practices. These regulations require us to comply with manufacturing safety standards, including protecting our employees from accidents, providing our employees with a safe and non-hostile work environment and being an equal opportunity employer. In California and Washington, we are also subject to employment and safety regulations issued by state and local authorities. Consistent with the employee enrichment focus area of the Social pillar of our ESG initiative we seek to go beyond required standards to give employees the tools and training that give rise to a proactive safety culture in which employees demonstrate our shared commitment to eliminating foreseeable dangers that could lead to injuries, work-related illnesses and other hazardous conditions. For example, our Estate vineyard employees are required to attend at least 15 hours of safety training annually.

Environmental regulation
As a result of our agricultural and wine production activities, we and certain third parties with which we work, are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater and stormwater discharges, and the treatment, handling and storage and disposal of materials and wastes. State environmental regulations and authorities intended to address and oversee environmental issues are largely state-level analogs to federal regulations and authorities intended to perform the similar purposes. In California, we are also subject to state-specific rules, such as those contained in the California Environmental Quality Act, California Air Resources Act, Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, California Water Code sections 13300-13999 and Title 23 of the California Administrative Code and various sections of the Health and Safety Code. We are subject to local environmental regulations that address a number of elements of our wine production process, including air quality, the handling of hazardous waste, recycling, water use and discharge, emissions and traffic impacts. In addition to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, our practices are rooted in the focus of the Environmental pillar of our ESG initiative, which focuses on thoughtfully responding to climate change, using resources in a sustainable manner and shifting towards more responsible packaging. 
Labeling regulation 
Many of our wines are identified by their appellation of origin, which are among the most highly regarded wine growing regions in the world. An appellation may be present on a wine label only if it meets the requirements of applicable state and federal regulations that seek to ensure the consistency and quality of wines from a specific terroir. These appellations designate the specific geographic origin of most or all (depending on the appellation) of the wine’s grapes, and can be a political subdivision (e.g., a country, state or county) or a designated viticultural area. The rules for vineyard designation are similar. Most of our labels maintain the same appellation of origin from year to year. The label of our famed Duckhorn Vineyard Napa Valley Merlot from the Three Palms Vineyard, for example, has borne the same AVA and vineyard designation for decades. From time to time, our winemakers choose to change the appellation of one of our wines to take advantage of high-quality grapes in other areas or to change the profile of a wine, such as the 2018 change of appellation of our Decoy Cabernet Sauvignon from Sonoma County to California. 
Agricultural and production-related regulation
In addition to the federal, state and local authorities which govern our business and activities in the areas noted above, we are also subject to regulations specific to agriculture and production activities. These rules allow regulators to inspect facilities, dictate agricultural worker protocols, regulate and inspect equipment and records with respect to weights and measures, in addition to allowing regulators to promulgate regulations with respect to the health and safety of employees working in agricultural and production settings. 
Privacy and security regulation 
Our Company collects personal information from individuals. Accordingly, we are subject to several data privacy and security related regulations, including but not limited to: U.S. state privacy, security and breach notification laws; the GDPR; and other European privacy laws as well as privacy laws being adopted in other regions around the world. In addition, the FTC and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of information about individuals. Certain states have also adopted robust data privacy and security laws and regulations. For example, the CCPA, which took effect in 2020, imposes obligations and restrictions on businesses regarding their collection, use, and sharing of personal information and provides new and enhanced data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording them the right to access and delete their personal information and to opt out of certain sharing of personal information. In response to the data privacy laws and regulations discussed above and those in other countries in which we do business, we have implemented several technological safeguards, processes, contractual provisions with third-parties, and employee trainings to help 
Table of Contents

ensure that we handle information about our employees and customers in a compliant manner. We maintain a global privacy policy and related procedures, and train our workforce to understand and comply with applicable privacy laws. 
Intellectual property 
We strive to protect the reputation of our winery brands and rely on a combination of aggressive defense of our intellectual property rights and the maintenance of control over our web and social media presence to achieve what we believe is an optimal level of protection. 
We establish, protect and defend our intellectual property in a number of ways, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, domestic and foreign trademark protections, intellectual property licenses and social media and information security policies for employees. We focus significant resources on tracking and monitoring our trademarks for potentially infringing marks. We, in conjunction with outside counsel, review information on a weekly basis from a number of sources, including the USPTO Official Gazette Watch, USPTO Pending Application Watch, COLA Watch and internal watch lists, as well as other foreign national gazettes, to uncover potentially infringing marks. 
Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our winery brand and our strong portfolio strength. As of July 31, 2022, we had three registered copyrights, 62 unique-mark trademarks, 20 pending trademark applications and 188 issued trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, foreign nations and international IP organizations, such as the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous URL designations, including Duckhorn.com, Decoywines.com, KostaBrowne.com, DuckhornPortfolio.com and DuckhornWineShop.com. We maintain and actively manage numerous company websites and social media accounts on social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. We claim copyright ownership of all unique content created by and for our Company published on those websites and platforms. 
We also rely on, and carefully protect, proprietary knowledge and expertise, including the sources of certain supplies, formulations, production processes, innovation regarding product development and other trade secrets necessary to maintain and enhance our competitive position.
