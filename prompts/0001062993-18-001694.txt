 We have received most of the operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies of our former subsidiary, BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. (BAK Tianjin). Such assets were acquired in exchange for a reduction in receivables from our former subsidiaries that were disposed in June 2014. We have outsourced and will continue to outsource our production to other manufacturers until our Dalian manufacturing facility can fulfill our customers needs. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased batteries approximately of $27.7 million from Shenzhen BAK. 
 On January 16, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a change in the Companys fiscal year end from September 30 to December 31. As a result of the change, our 2017 fiscal year began on January 1, 2017 and ended on December 31, 2017. 
 We generated revenues of $58.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and $10.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 respectively. We had a net loss of $21.5 million and $12.7 million in fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $163.5 million and net assets of $2.2 million. We had a working capital deficiency and accumulated deficit from recurring net losses and short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of December 31, 2017. 
 On June 14, 2016, we renewed our banking facilities from Bank of Dandong for loans with a maximum amount of RMB130 million (approximately $20.0 million), including three-year long-term loans and three-year revolving bank acceptance and letters of credit bills for the period from June 13, 2016 to June 12, 2019.

On August 2, 2017, we obtained one-year term facilities from China Merchants Bank with a maximum amount of RMB100 million (approximately $15.4 million) including revolving loans, trade finance, notes discount and acceptance of commercial bills etc. Any amount drawn under the facilities requires security in the form of cash or banking acceptance bills receivable of at least the same amount. Under the facilities, as of December 31, 2017, we borrowed a series of bank acceptance bills from China Merchants Bank totaled $10 million and pledged $10 million of our bills receivables. 
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we also obtained banking facilities from Bank of Dandong with bank acceptance bills of RMB57.7 million (approximately $9 million) for a term until June 28, 2018. The banking facilities were pledged by our bills receivables totaled $9 million. Under the facilities, as of December 31, 2017, we borrowed bank acceptance totaled $9 million. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had unutilized committed banking facilities of $5.5 million. 
 In June 2016, we received advances in the aggregate of $2.9 million from Mr. Jiping Zhou and Mr. Dawei Li. These advances were unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable on demand. On July 8, 2016, we received further advances of $2.6 million from Mr. Jiping Zhou. On July 28, 2016, to convert these advances into equity interests in our Company, we entered into securities purchase agreements with Mr. Jiping Zhou and Mr. Dawei Li to issue and sell an aggregate of 2,206,640 shares of our common stock, at $2.5 per share, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $5.52 million. On August 17, 2016, we issued these shares to the investors. 
 On February 17, 2017, we signed a letter of understanding with each of eight individual investors, who are also our current shareholders, including our CEO, Mr. Yunfei Li, whereby these shareholders agreed in principle to subscribe for new shares of our common stock totaling $10 million. The issue price will be determined with reference to the market price prior to the issuance of new shares In January 2017, the shareholders paid us a total of $2.1 million as refundable deposits, among which, Mr. Yunfei Li agreed to subscribe new shares totaling $1.12 million and pay a refundable deposit of $0.2 million. The issuance of the shares to the investors is expected to be made in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering, and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. In April and May 2017, we received cash of $9.6 million from these shareholders. On May 31, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with these investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue an aggregate of 6,403,518 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share to these investors, at a purchase price of $1.50 per share, for an aggregate price of $9.6 million, including 746,018 shares were issued to Mr. Yunfei Li, our CEO. On June 22, 2017, we issued the shares to the investors. The issuance of the shares to the investors was made in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering, and Regulation S promulgated thereunder. 
 In the meanwhile, due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government has been providing vigorous support to the development of new energy facilities and vehicles for several years. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market, especially from the electric car market. We believe that with the booming market demand in high power lithium ion products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability. 
 In 2015, to promote the development of electric vehicles industry, the Chinese central government issued a subsidy policy named Notice of 2016-2020 New Energy Vehicles Promotion with Financial Support, which regulated subsidies for consumers in purchase of electric vehicles from central government and local government. According to the policy, it regulates a certain subsidy standard for various types of electric vehicles, in connection with the endurance mileage, battery pack energy density, energy consumption level, etc. It also regulates that the local government can provide subsidy not more than 50% of the standard. According to the subsidy policy for 2017, the subsidy standard for passenger electric vehicles is RMB20,000 to RMB44,000 based on the endurance mileage; and the subsidy standard for non-fast charge electric buses and fast charge electric buses is RMB1,800/kwh and RMB3,000/kwh, respectively. According to the latest subsidy policy for 2018, the subsidy standard is decreased to RMB1,200/kwh, RMB1,200/kwh and RMB2,100/kwh for passenger electric vehicles, non-fast charge electric buses and fast charge electric buses, respectively. 
 In addition, on December 26, 2017, the Chinese central government issued policy for exemption of purchase tax for electric vehicles for another three years until 2020. 
 To respond to the market demand for high quality batteries with high energy density and strong endurance mileage, we have been constructing a new production line for production of high capacity prismatic batteries. Each battery will be 260Ah in capacity. It is expected to be put into production by September 2018 and the manufacturing capability will be about 5000 unit per day.

Our Corporate History and Structure 
 We conduct our current business through the following two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China that we own through BAK Asia, a holding company formed under the laws of Hong Kong: 

 | CBAK Trading, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on August 14, 2013, focuses on the wholesale of lithium batteries and lithium batteries materials, import & export business and related technology consulting service; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | CBAK Power, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on December 27, 2013, focuses on the development and manufacture of high-power lithium batteries. 

 Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure: 
 
Our Products 
 The use of new materials have enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, energy storage and uninterruptible power supply, or UPS. 
 We believe high power lithium batteries represent the main direction of the development of new energy vehicle technologies according to the 12th Five-Year Plan published by the Chinese government. 
 Our Dalian manufacturing facilities focus on the development and manufacture of high power lithium batteries, for use in the following end applications:

Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications 
 End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other high power applications. 
 Electric Vehicles
An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium batterys relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing. 
 Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or green technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells. 
 The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China's new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. After explosive growth in 2016, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow tremendously in 2017. According to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (MIIT), from January to December 2017, the production of new energy vehicles in China reached 794,000 units - up 53.8 percent year-on-year; and sales in China reached 777,000 units - up 53.3 percent year-on-year. As the core mechanism for new energy vehicles, the power battery industry has also recently welcomed an unprecedented growth. According to the Development Program for the Energy Efficient and New Energy Vehicle Industry 2012-2020 designed by the State Council of the PRC, some major objectives are: to enthusiastically advance innovation in power battery technologies; scientifically plan the industrial layout; focus on developing power battery industry clusters; and actively promote the mass production of power batteries. With the recent introduction of a number of supporting policies, the production of power batteries for vehicles has grown remarkably. 
 Light Electric Vehicles
Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles, with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. The electric bicycle market in China is huge. According to MIIT, from January to December 2017, the production of electric bicycles in China was 31.1 million units, up 2.3% year-on-year. 
 Energy Storage
Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants. 
 Electric Tools
Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools. 
 6 

Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)
A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium batterys relatively small size, light design and environmentally-friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing. 
 Revenue by Products
Before June 30, 2014, we derived our revenues from BAK International and its subsidiaries which produced prismatic cells, cylindrical cells, lithium polymer cells and high-power lithium batteries. Since July 1, 2014, our revenue has been mainly from Dalian CBAK Power for sale of batteries manufactured by BAK Tianjin under outsourcing arrangements. Starting from October 2015, we generated revenues from high-power lithium battery cells manufactured by Dalian CBAK Power as well as batteries outsourced from BAK Tianjin, Shenzhen BAK and other manufacturers. The following table sets forth the breakdown of our net revenues by product types:

 Sales and Marketing
We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where Chinas main EV and LEV productions is located, such as Beijing, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province, Sichuan Province and three provinces in Northeast China. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products. 
 We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants. 
 Suppliers
The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing our products. We believe that there is an ample supply of most of the raw materials we need in China. We are seeking to identify alternative raw material suppliers to the extent there are viable alternatives and to expand our use of alternative raw materials. 
 We aim to maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials to ensure that supply problems with any one supplier will not materially disrupt our operations. In addition, we strive to develop strategic relationships with new suppliers to secure a stable supply of materials and introduce competition in our supply chain, thereby increasing our ability to negotiate better pricing and reducing our exposure to possible price fluctuations.
