Company Background
 
MJ Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (herein after “MJ Holdings”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide infrastructure, consulting and construction services, in addition to holding, and managing third party state issued cultivation and production licenses.
 
MJ Holdings was originally incorporated on November 17, 2006, as Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada. Prior to the formation of Securitas EDGAR Filings Inc., the business was operated as Xpedient EDGAR Filings, LLC, a Florida Limited Liability Company, formed on October 31, 2005. On November 21, 2005, Xpedient EDGAR Filings LLC amended its Articles of Organization to change its name to Securitas EDGAR Filings, LLC. On January, 21 2009, Securitas EDGAR Filings LLC merged into Securitas EDGAR Filings, Inc., a Nevada corporation. On February 14, 2014, we amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to MJ Holdings, Inc.
 
From February 2014 to January 2017, we owned and leased real estate properties zoned for legalized marijuana operations to licensed marijuana operators.
 
On November 22, 2016, in connection with a plan to divest ourselves of our real estate business, we submitted to our stockholders an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) our common stock for shares in MJ Real Estate Partners, LLC, (“MJRE”) a newly formed LLC formed for the sole purpose of effecting the Exchange Offer. On January 10, 2017, the Company accepted for exchange 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for 1,800,000 shares of MJRE’s common units, representing membership interests in MJRE. Effective February 1, 2017, the Company transferred its ownership interests in the real estate properties and its subsidiaries, through which the Company holds ownership of the real estate properties, to MJRE. MJRE also assumed the senior notes and any and all obligations associated with the real estate properties and business, effective February 1, 2017.
 
Reverse Merger
 
On December 15, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Red Earth LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“Red Earth”) established in October 2016, in exchange for 52,732,969 shares of our common stock of the Company and a promissory note in the amount of $900,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby Red Earth was considered the accounting acquirer and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the consummation of the acquisition, the now-former members of Red Earth became the beneficial owners of approximately 88% of the Company’s common stock, obtained controlling interest of the Company, and retained key management positions of the Company. In accordance with the accounting treatment for a “reverse merger” or a “reverse acquisition,” the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Red Earth prior to the reverse merger in all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The consolidated financial statements after completion of the reverse merger will include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the combined company from and after the closing date of the reverse merger, with only certain aspects of pre-consummation stockholders’ equity remaining in the consolidated financial statements.

Our Business
 
Through our acquisition of Red Earth and their wholly owned subsidiary, HDGLV, LLC (“HDGLV”) we expect to commence legal marijuana cultivation activities in the third quarter of 2018 upon approval by the Nevada Department of Taxation of the transfer of a Provisional Cultivation License to Red Earth and the required state and city approvals for our cultivation facility. It is our intention to grow our business through the acquisition of existing companies and/or through the development of new opportunities that can provide a 360-degree spectrum of infrastructure (dispensaries), cultivation and production management, and consulting services in the regulated cannabis industry.
 
Through Red Earth, we hold a provisional State of Nevada issued cannabis cultivation license, and through HDGLV, we hold a triple-net leasehold, with an option to buy, on a 17,298 square-foot building, which will be home to our cultivation facility.
 
Marijuana Industry Overview
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds”. The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ than for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately 4 meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”), which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of December 2017, there are a total of 30 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
As of December 2017, 30 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different. Additionally, 8 states and the Washington D.C. now allow for recreational use of marijuana. (California became the 9th state to legalize adult recreational marijuana use in January 2018).

Decriminalization of marijuana varies by state. As of January 2018, 13 states have decriminalized the non-medical use and possession of marijuana for personal consumption. Decriminalization generally means that violators of local marijuana laws may be subject to civil penalty rather than face criminal prosecution. In three states, Idaho, South Dakota and Kansas, the cultivation, possession or use of marijuana is strictly prohibited and violators may be subject to criminal prosecution.
 
For example, Nevada legalized marijuana for recreational use, effective July 1, 2017, making it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, businesses can legally, pursuant to state regulations, cultivate, process, dispense, distribute, and test marijuana products under certain conditions.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has also limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. Recently the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
The United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, known as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer is an amendment to the annual appropriations bill that prohibits the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition is currently in place until September 30, 2018.
 
We are monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We currently operate medical marijuana businesses in Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana is permitted in Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.

Red Earth / HDGLV
 
Red Earth’s assets are a provisional cultivation license to grow marijuana within the City of Las Vegas in the State of Nevada and all of the outstanding membership interests in HDGLV LLC, which holds a triple net leasehold interest in a 17,298 square-foot building located at 2310 Western Avenue in Las Vegas, Nevada, which we will operate as an indoor marijuana cultivation and an agritourism destination. We expect to complete construction of this facility by early Q3 2018. This facility is intended to serve as a draw for tourists who desire to visit, see, and learn about the inner-workings of a cannabis cultivation facility.
 
In April 2018, the State of Nevada finalized and approved the transfer of our provisional cultivation license to Red Earth. In July 2018, we completed the first phase of construction on our cultivation facility and expect to obtain final approvals towards perfecting the cultivation license from the appropriate authorities, but we can provide no assurances on the receipt and/or timing of the final approvals.
 
We may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies have also been granted cultivation licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that we will face competition from these other companies. Our management team has experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating marijuana cultivation and related businesses in other legal cannabis markets. We believe our experience in cultivation and facility management will provide us with a competitive advantage over our competitors.
 
Revenue
 
From inception (October 17, 2016) to December 31, 2017, we had not generated any revenues. Subject to the receipt of the required State of Nevada and City of Las Vegas approvals, we expect to commence operation of our cultivation facility in Q3 2018 and realize revenues beginning in Q4 2018. There can be no assurance that we will receive the requisite approvals or that we will generate meaningful revenues thereafter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 4 full-time employees.
