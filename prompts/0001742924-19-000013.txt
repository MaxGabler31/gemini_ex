ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

FMC Corporation formed and incorporated FMC Lithium USA Holding Corp. in the State of Delaware on February 27, 2018, which was subsequently renamed Livent Corporation ("Livent"). Livent's principal executive offices are located at 2929 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except where otherwise stated or indicated by the context, “Livent”, the "Company", “we,” “us,” or “our” means Livent Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries and their predecessors after giving effect to the transactions described under “The Separation" and "The Distribution" below, and references to “FMC,” and “Parent” refer to FMC Corporation, Livent’s parent, and its consolidated subsidiaries other than Livent and Livent’s subsidiaries. Unless the context requires otherwise, statements relating to our history throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K describe the history of FMC’s lithium segment. Copies of the annual, quarterly and current reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and any amendments to those reports, are available on our website at www.livent.com as soon as practicable after we furnish such materials to the SEC.
The Separation 
On March 31, 2017, FMC publicly announced a plan to separate Livent into a publicly traded company (the “Separation”). Prior to the completion of the initial public offering ("IPO") on October 15, 2018, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of FMC, and all of our outstanding shares of common stock were owned by FMC. Following a series of restructuring steps, on October 1, 2018, prior to the IPO of Livent common stock, FMC transferred to us substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its lithium business (the “Lithium Business”). In exchange, we issued to FMC 123 million shares of our common stock. 
On October 15, 2018 (the "Separation Date"), we completed the IPO and sold 20 million shares of Livent common stock to the public at a price of $17.00 per share. On November 8, 2018, the underwriters exercised, in full, their option (the "Over-allotment Option Exercise") to purchase an additional 3 million shares of our common stock, the closing of which was completed on November 13, 2018. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “LTHM.”
Net proceeds from the sale of 23 million shares of our common stock issued in connection with the IPO and Over-allotment Option Exercise were approximately $369 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds from the offering, after payment of financing fees and other IPO related costs, were subsequently distributed to FMC. Immediately following the IPO and the Over-allotment Option Exercise, FMC owned approximately 84% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we are considered a “controlled company” under the NYSE rules. Further details can be found in the final Prospectus ("Prospectus") included in our Registration Statement on Form S-1 originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 12, 2018, as amended. 
In connection with the Separation and completion of the IPO, we entered into certain agreements with FMC that govern various interim and ongoing relationships between the parties. These agreements include a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a shareholders’ agreement, a tax matters agreement, a registration rights agreement, an employee matters agreement and a trademark license agreement. 
The Distribution 
FMC has informed us that it plans to make a tax-free distribution to its stockholders of all of its remaining equity interest in us on March 1, 2019. The distribution (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the "Distribution") is expected to be effected as a dividend to all FMC stockholders.
General
We are a pure-play, fully integrated lithium company, with a long, proven history of producing performance lithium compounds. Our primary products, namely battery-grade lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications. Our strategy is to focus on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast- growing electric vehicle ("EV") battery market, while continuing to maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal. With extensive global capabilities, over 60 years of continuous production experience, applications and technical expertise and deep customer relationships, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trend of vehicle electrification. 
5

We produce lithium compounds for use in applications that have specific performance requirements, including battery-grade lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithium-ion batteries. We believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates, and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products. We also supply butyllithium, which is used as a synthesizer in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products, as well as a range of specialty lithium compounds including high purity lithium metal, which is used in the production of lightweight materials for aerospace applications and non-rechargeable batteries. It is in these applications that we have established a differentiated position in the market through our ability to consistently produce and deliver performance lithium compounds. 
Livent Strategy
We believe that growth in EV sales will drive significant growth in demand for performance lithium compounds. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend thanks to our leading position and long-standing customer relationships. To fully capitalize on this opportunity, our strategy will involve investing in our assets, our technology capabilities and our people to ensure we can continue to meet our customers’ demands. 
Expand our Production Capacities 
In February 2018, we announced our intention to expand our lithium hydroxide capacity to approximately 55 thousand metric tons ("kMT") by the end of 2025 at multiple locations. These expansions are to have the capacity to meet customer demands globally, as they expand their own production networks around the globe. 
In addition, to support our lithium hydroxide expansion, we have announced plans to expand annual lithium carbonate production in Argentina from 15 kMT in 2017 to at least 60 kMT by the end of 2025, in four separate stages. We expect to consume the majority of any incremental lithium carbonate produced internally or sourced externally in our lithium hydroxide operations. 
We also continue to add butyllithium capacity at our China facility as demand in Asia continues to increase. For high purity lithium metal, we are evaluating expansion opportunities to align with the potential increase in demand for lithium metal as our customers develop next generation battery technologies. 
Diversify our Sources of Supply 
We continue to pursue additional sources of lithium carbonate, which may include further expansion in Argentina, acquisition and development of new resources, entering into long-term supply agreements with other producers or some combination thereof. We will continually assess new resources that offer the potential to provide alternative sources of lithium carbonate and will look to invest in developing such resources where it makes sense to do so. 
6

Expand our Application and Process Technology Capabilities 
Our market position today is built upon our ability to consistently provide our customers with the products they need. To maintain this position, we are continuously investing in our application and process technologies. As we work with our customers to understand their evolving lithium needs, we will focus on improving our own abilities to adapt the properties of our products, whether physical or chemical, to meet those needs. This may require us to invest in and potentially acquire new capabilities, hire people or acquire new technical resources. 
Develop Next Generation Lithium Compounds 
We believe that the evolution of battery technologies will lead to the adoption of lithium-based applications in the anode and electrolyte within the battery. This evolution will require new forms of lithium to be produced, such as new lithium metal powders or printable lithium products. We will continue to invest in our research and development efforts to help us create new products, and will also invest with and partner alongside our customers to further their own research and development efforts. 
Invest in Our People 
Our business requires that we hire and retain the best research scientists, engineers and technical salesforce in our industry. We will continue to invest in our people through training and developing our employees to ensure we retain the best talent in the industry. 
Financial Information About Our Business 
We operate as one reportable segment based on the commonalities among our products and services, the types of customers we serve and the manner in which we review and evaluate operating performance. As we earn substantially all of our revenues through the sale of lithium products, we have concluded that we have one operating segment for reporting purposes. 
Business Overview
As a result of our focus on supplying performance lithium compounds for use in the rapidly growing EV market, we expect the shares of lithium hydroxide, energy storage and Asia as percentages of our total revenue by product, application and geography, respectively, to increase. We intend to maintain our leadership positions in other high performance markets such as greases and polymers. 
We believe that we have earned a reputation as a leading supplier in the markets we serve, based on the performance of our products in our customers’ production processes and our ability to provide application know-how and technical support. In the EV market, we are one of a small number of lithium suppliers whose battery-grade lithium hydroxide has been qualified by customers for use in their cathode material production processes. Throughout our history, as end market application technologies have evolved, we have worked closely with our customers to understand their changing performance requirements and have developed products to address their needs. 
As a vertically integrated producer, we benefit from operating one of the lowest cost lithium mineral deposits in the world. We have been extracting lithium brine at our operations at the Salar del Hombre Muerto in Argentina for more than 20 years, and have been producing lithium compounds for over 60 years. Our operational history provides us with a deep understanding of the process to extract lithium compounds from brine. We have developed proprietary process knowledge that enables us to produce high quality, low impurity lithium carbonate and lithium chloride. We source the majority of our base lithium compounds for use in the production of performance lithium compounds from these low cost operations in Argentina. Our operations in Argentina are expandable, giving us the ability to increase our lithium carbonate and lithium chloride production to meet increasing demand. We also have the operational flexibility to procure lithium carbonate from third party suppliers as raw materials. This strategy allows us to manage our production requirements and raw material cost, creating opportunities to optimize profitability. 
We are one of a few lithium compound producers with global manufacturing capabilities. We use the majority of the lithium carbonate we produce in the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the United States and China. We use the lithium chloride we produce in the production of butyllithium products in the United States, the United Kingdom, China and India, as well as in the production of high purity lithium metal in the United States. We have significant know-how and experience in the lithium hydroxide, butyllithium and high purity lithium metal production processes and product applications, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in these markets. 
Capacity and Production
The chart below presents a breakdown of our capacity and production by product type and category presented in product basis metric tons ("MT") for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

Products and Markets
Our performance lithium compounds are frequently produced to meet specific customer application and performance requirements. We have developed our capabilities in producing performance lithium compounds through decades of interaction with our customers, and our products are key inputs into their production processes. Our customer relationships provide us with first-hand insight into our customers’ production objectives and future needs, which we in turn use to further develop our products. 
Other specialties include lithium phosphate, pharmaceutical-grade lithium carbonate, high purity lithium chloride and specialty organics. In addition to performance lithium compounds, we also produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride, both of which we largely consume as feedstock in the process of producing our performance lithium compounds. 
Competition and Industry Overview 
We sell our performance lithium compounds worldwide. Most markets for lithium compounds are global, with significant growth occurring in Asia, driven primarily by the development and manufacture of lithium-ion batteries. The market for lithium compounds also faces some barriers to entry, including access to an adequate and stable supply of lithium, technical expertise and development lead time. According to Roskill's 2018 estimates, we are one of six producers, including SQM, Albemarle, Tianqi, Orocobre and Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, that accounted for approximately 78% of the global supply of lithium compounds as measured by lithium carbon equivalent ("LCE"). We expect additional capacity to be added by new and existing producers over time. We believe our lithium brines in Salar del Hombre Muerto, Argentina, considered by the industry to be one of the lowest cost sources of lithium, provide us with a distinct competitive advantage against these current or future entrants. 
We compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner. We believe we are a leading provider of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in EV battery applications and of performance greases and benefit from low production costs and a history of efficient capital deployment. We also believe we are one of only two global suppliers of butyllithium. Our primary competitor for performance lithium compounds is Albemarle Corporation. We are the only producer of high purity lithium metal in the Western Hemisphere and enjoy competitive advantages from our vertically integrated manufacturing approach and low production costs. Our primary competitors within the lithium metal product category include Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium and other Chinese producers.

Growth
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance's May 2018 report, EV sales are expected to exceed 60.2 million units in 2040, representing a penetration rate of 55% of all vehicles sold. Automotive OEMs have announced plans to introduce longer-range EV models using higher energy density batteries, and are increasingly doing so by moving to high nickel content cathode materials. This shift will increasingly require battery-grade lithium hydroxide in the production of cathode materials. 
As an existing, proven global producer of battery-grade lithium hydroxide, we are well positioned to benefit from this expected increase in lithium demand from EV growth. As one of the pioneers in the lithium industry, we have relationships throughout the lithium-ion battery value chain. Across the battery value chain, product performance requirements have continued to evolve since the first lithium-ion batteries were introduced in the early 1990s. We have developed our application and materials knowledge by working with our customers over time to produce performance lithium compounds which meet evolving customer needs. 
In February 2018, we announced an intention to expand annual lithium hydroxide production capacity to approximately 55 kMT by the end of 2025. 
Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable lithium products. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of collaboration agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize.

Raw Materials 
Lithium 
Our primary raw material is lithium, and we obtain the substantial majority of our lithium from our operations in Argentina. We extract lithium through solar evaporation and a proprietary process from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines located in the Andes Mountains of Argentina, which are believed to be one of the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium. We process the brine into lithium carbonate at our co-located manufacturing facility in Fenix, Argentina and into lithium chloride at our nearby manufacturing facility in Güemes, Argentina. 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our Argentine operations extracted and processed approximately 17 kMT and 15 kMT of lithium carbonate, respectively, and approximately 5 kMT of lithium chloride for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
In 2018 and 2017, we expanded production of lithium carbonate at these facilities through debottlenecking projects as well as announced plans to more than triple lithium carbonate production at this site to at least 60 kMT per year by the end of 2025. We also purchase a minority portion of our lithium carbonate raw materials from other suppliers.
9

In October 2016, we entered into a long-term supply agreement (the “Agreement”) with Nemaska Lithium Shawinigan Transformation Inc. (“Nemaska”), a subsidiary of Nemaska Lithium Inc. based in Quebec, Canada. Pursuant to the Agreement, Nemaska is to provide lithium carbonate to us from an electrochemical plant that is under construction. Since completion of the project financing had significantly delayed the construction of its electrochemical plant, Nemaska had reported that it was not in position to start delivering lithium carbonate according to the schedule in the Agreement. 
To enforce our right to supply under the Agreement, in July 2018, we filed for arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (in accordance with the Agreement’s terms). In an attempt to resolve the dispute, the parties actively negotiated a revised schedule as well as arrangements to see that (in spec) lithium carbonate be nonetheless supplied to us from alternative sources under the responsibility of Nemaska, with a view to providing us with product while minimizing Nemaska’s exposure until its electrochemical plant is in operation. 
On September 25, 2018, the parties agreed to suspend the arbitration process under the expectation that the parties would agree on arrangements regarding alternative supply sources and an amended and restated supply agreement to reflect such alternative arrangements. On February 15, 2019, we received written notice from Nemaska that it was terminating the Agreement. Livent disagrees that Nemaska has the right to terminate the Agreement. Since we received Nemaska’s termination notice, we have resumed our previously suspended arbitration and intend to vigorously pursue our claims. However, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in arbitration. 
Salar del Hombre Muerto
We conduct our Argentine operations through Minera del Altiplano SA ("MdA"), our local operating subsidiary. We extract lithium from naturally occurring lithium-rich brines in Salar del Hombre Muerto, an area covering approximately 600 square kilometers in a region of the Andes Mountains of northwest Argentina known as the “lithium triangle.” This area of the Central Andes is within an arid plateau with numerous volcanic peaks and salt flats known as “salars” and is the principal lithium-bearing region of South America. 
Salar del Hombre Muerto consists of evaporite deposits formed within an isolated basin depression. Fault-bounded bedrock hills occur within and along the margins of the salar basin, subdividing the Salar del Hombre Muerto into two separate sub-basins (eastern and western), each with different evaporite sediment compositions. The eastern sub-basin is dominated by borate evaporites, whereas the western sub-basin is relatively free of clastic sediment (such as sand, silts and clays) and is dominated by halite (sodium chloride) evaporite deposits. 
We performed initial geological investigations of the Salar del Hombre Muerto in the early 1990s, prior to development of our lithium production facilities. We commenced commercial extraction operations in Salar del Hombre Muerto in 1998. Lithium extract is processed into lithium carbonate at our co-located manufacturing facility in Fenix, Argentina and into lithium chloride at our nearby manufacturing facility in Güemes, Argentina. These facilities were opened in conjunction with the commencement of our extraction operations and are in good working condition. MdA owns these facilities. We use natural gas and diesel to generate electricity, which is the principal source of power at our facilities. From time to time, we experience interruptions in the supply of electricity, but we do not believe these interruptions materially impact our operations. 
Brine containing approximately 600 parts per million ("ppm") lithium is pumped from saltwater aquifers using extraction wells. The brine is then diverted to an evaporation pond system. We have also developed a proprietary lithium concentration and purification process for brine operations that significantly reduces the time from pumping brine from the Salar to processing it into lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. This reduction in processing time compares favorably to a conventional solar evaporation process, while effectively removing impurities and providing increased process control. During evaporation, other minerals, such as sodium, potassium and magnesium, which are typically contained in brine, are concentrated and removed through processing. The resulting lithium chloride brine from the terminal pond of the system is then routed to our processing plants. 
We access our extraction sites and nearby manufacturing facilities by local roadway, which is a suitable transportation alternative. We transport the brine extract from our Fenix facility by truck to our Güemes facility for processing. We then transport the processed lithium carbonate and lithium chloride by truck to ports in Argentina and Chile, where it is shipped by vessel to our manufacturing facilities and customers. 
Mineral concession rights 
MdA holds title to mineral concession rights for its extraction activities in Salar del Hombre Muerto. These mineral concession rights cover an area of approximately 327 square kilometers and are granted to MdA pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code. See subsection “Argentine Law and Regulation” to this Item 1 for more information. Pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code, MdA’s mineral concession rights are valid until the deposit is depleted of all minerals. The concession rights may be rescinded if we fail to pay fees or do not actively extract minerals for a period lasting more than four years. 
In 1991, MdA entered into an ongoing agreement, for so long a time as our mineral concession is valid, with the Argentine federal government and the Catamarca province in connection with the development of the Salar del Hombre Muerto exploration site. Following legislative and constitutional reforms in 1993 and 1994, the Argentine federal government assigned all of its rights and 
10

obligations under the agreement to the Catamarca province. The agreement governs limited matters relating to our production activities and grants to the Catamarca province an immaterial minority ownership stake in MdA, which enables the province to receive certain dividends and to appoint two of MdA’s ten member Board of Directors and one of MdA’s three member audit committee. The term of the agreement expires when MdA ceases to extract and produce lithium compounds from Salar del Hombre Muerto. 
MdA is required to pay the Catamarca province an immaterial semi-annual “canon” fee pursuant to the Argentine Mining Code and royalties equal to 3% of the pithead value of the minerals extracted by MdA pursuant to the Argentine Mining Investment Law and Catamarca provincial law. Total payments to the Catamarca province equaled $5.3 million, $3.3 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Under an amendment to its long term agreement with Catamarca entered into on January 25, 2018, and contingent upon the receipt of certain required permits, MdA will instead pay the Catamarca province a monthly contribution and royalty payment. Together, the contribution and royalty amount will equal 2% of sales of products in a given month measured at the higher of MdA’s average invoice price or an average international price for similar products, net of tax. Royalty payments to the province are netted to give effect to any dividends it receives as a result of its ownership stake in MdA. Total payments to the Catamarca province, including water trust and CSR payments, would have been approximately $9.2 million, $6.5 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 had the amendment described above been in effect for all twelve months for such years. 
A portion of the territory governed by our concession rights is subject to a longstanding border dispute between Catamarca and the adjacent Salta province. The border dispute has not impacted our operations for the 21 years we have been operating in Argentina and we do not expect that it will impact our operations going forward. We estimate the total area in dispute represents approximately 7.6% of our concession (approximately 25 square kilometers). We do not view this as material, especially considering that the area in question is largely at the fringe of the salar, where the deposits are not as thick and the grade of lithium concentration is much lower. 
Although to date the Salta province has not commenced any judicial actions against us, the Salta province claims that it is entitled to royalties from us for the minerals extracted within the small portion of our concession that falls within the disputed territory, although under Argentine law we cannot be charged duplicate royalties for the same minerals. In addition, the Salta province has granted and may grant mineral concessions in the disputed territory to other parties, although to date Catamarca authorities have not permitted any others to extract lithium from within the boundaries of our concession. 
Water 
Our Argentine operations require fresh water. We have water rights for the supply of fresh water from the Trapiche aquifer, from which water is pumped through a battery of wells to our facilities. Our water use is managed in a sustainable and environmentally sensitive manner, and we and the Catamarca province regularly monitor the water and salinity levels of the aquifer. We have only once had to temporarily suspend water extraction, which was due to a dispute with the Catamarca province, and our access to our water source was quickly restored. We also regularly evaluate supplemental supplies of fresh water. The grant of water concessions and other water rights is subject to local governmental approvals, the timing and availability of which are uncertain and may be subject to delay or denial. 
 In October 2015, MdA entered into a trust agreement with the Catamarca province that was amended in 2018. Under the amended trust agreement, MdA is obligated to pay an amount equal to 1.2% of its annual sales determined in a manner consistent with the contribution and royalty payments described above in the "Mineral Concession Rights" subsection to this Item 1, which payment obligations are fully reflected in our financial statements, in lieu of any water use fees. 
Energy 
Our Argentine operations rely on a steady source of energy. In 2015, we completed construction of a 135 kilometer natural gas pipeline from Pocitos, within the Salta province, to our Fenix facilities at Salar del Hombre Muerto, which eliminated our reliance on natural gas shipments by truck. This pipeline is governed by various agreements between MdA and Recursos Energeticos y Mineros Salta, S.A., or REMSA, a local natural gas sub-distributor, including a subdistribution agreement providing for contracted capacity through 2027. We are in discussions to increase our contracted capacity in advance of our needs for all phases of our expansion plans and may need to invest in additional infrastructure to support this expansion. REMSA has no obligation to provide us the additional capacity on a timely basis or at all. If we cannot obtain such additional capacity, we would need to secure alternative arrangements to meet the increased energy needs of the planned expansion and such alternative arrangements may be less cost effective. 
MdA also has a natural gas supply contract with Pluspetrol providing for the supply of natural gas for our Fenix manufacturing facility. This supply agreement expires in April 2019 and is typically renewed on an annual basis. We also have a purchase agreement with YPF SA for the supply of diesel fuel and gasoline to our Fenix and Güemes manufacturing facilities, pursuant to which we submit monthly purchase orders. 
11

Other raw materials 
We purchase raw materials and chemical intermediates for use in our production processes, including materials for use in our production of the proprietary absorbent used to selectively extract lithium from our brine in Argentina, soda ash, or sodium carbonate, for use in our production of lithium carbonate, and lithium metal for our production of butyllithium. In 2018 and 2017, costs of major raw materials represented 9% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively. Major raw materials include soda ash, solvents, butyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, quicklime and caustic soda. We generally satisfy our requirements through spot purchases and medium- or long-term contractual relationships. In general, where we have limited sources of raw materials, we have developed contingency plans to minimize the effect of any interruption or reduction in supply, such as sourcing from other suppliers or maintaining safety stocks. 
Temporary shortages of raw materials may occasionally occur and cause temporary price increases. For example, we have had past regional interruptions in raw material supply, notably in China. In recent years, these shortages have not resulted in any material unavailability of raw materials. However, the continuing availability and price of raw materials are affected by many factors, including domestic and world market and political conditions, as well as the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulations. During periods of high demand, our raw materials are subject to significant price fluctuations, and such fluctuations may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The impact of any future raw material shortages on our business as a whole or in specific geographic regions, including China, or in specific business lines cannot be accurately predicted. 
Seasonality
Our operations in Argentina are seasonally impacted by weather, including varying evaporation rates and amounts of rainfall during different seasons. These changes impact the concentration in large evaporation ponds and can have an impact on the downstream processes to produce lithium carbonate and lithium chloride. Our operations team continuously measures pond concentrations and models how they will change based on operating decisions. Our processes use proprietary and traditional technologies to minimize the variation of concentrations at the inlet to our plants. In 2018, there were no unexpected impacts from these seasonal factors. 
Argentine Law and Regulation 
We are subject to various regulatory requirements in Argentina under the Argentine Mining Code, the Argentine Mining Investment Law and certain federal and provincial regulations, including with respect to environmental compliance. In addition, the relationship between us, MdA and the Catamarca provincial government is regulated through a contractual framework. 
The Argentine Mining Code, which sets forth the rights and obligations of both mining companies and their workers, is the principal regulatory framework under which we conduct our operations in Argentina. Under Section 7 of the Argentine Mining Code, minerals derived from Argentine land belong to the provinces or the federal state, depending on where they are found. However, the provinces themselves are not permitted to exploit or extract such resources. Instead, the provinces regulate and administer the granting of mining rights to third parties. 
The Argentine Mining Code establishes two basic means of granting title to mining property: the exploration permit and the mining concession, both of which convey valid mining title in Argentina. Any entity or individual person may apply for either type of permit, and there are no separate restrictions imposed on foreign legal entities or individuals to apply for mining property in Argentina. 
Exploration permits grant their holders the right to freely explore for minerals within the boundaries of the territory covered by that permit as well as to request the mining concession for any discoveries within the covered territory. Exploration permits are valid for a finite period of time, which varies in accordance with the size of the areas covered by the permit. After an exploration permit has been issued, and new minerals have been discovered in the area covered by the exploration permit, its recipient may commence the procedures of obtaining a mining concession for the covered territory. Mining concessions may be also be obtained without the applicant first holding an exploration permit, provided that the covered area is free of other concession claims. 
Once a mining concession is granted, the recipient owns all in-place mineral deposits within the boundaries of the territory covered by the concession. Mining concessions are freely tradable by the title holder and can be sold, leased or otherwise transferred to third parties. Two requirements must be met to keep a mining concession in good standing: (i) the concession holder must make regular payments of a semi-annual fee known as a canon; and (ii) the concession holder must file and perform an initial five year expenditure plan. In addition, prior to commencing mining activities, the concession holder must submit environmental impact studies, which must be renewed at least every two years, for approval by the relevant environmental authorities. 
In addition to the Argentine Mining Code, we are also subject to the Argentine Mining Investment Law. The Argentine Mining Investment Law offers specific financial incentives to mining investors, including a 30 year term fiscal stability of national, provincial and municipal tax rates; a deduction from income tax for prospecting, exploration and feasibility study expenditures; a refund of Value Added Tax fiscal credits resulting from exploration works; accelerated depreciation of fixed assets; duty free importation of fixed assets to be used in the mining production process; and a 3% cap on royalties payable out of production to the province where the deposit is located. 
12

Of note, our fiscal stability rights under the Argentine Mining Investment Law have been challenged by the imposition of certain export taxes on our lithium chloride and carbonate exports that did not exist at the time we obtained our 30 year term fiscal stability certificate. Under such certificate, we are entitled to reimbursement or setoff (against other federal taxes) of any amount paid in excess of the total federal taxable burden applicable to us under such certificate. Although we are litigating to exercise our fiscal stability rights with respect to the imposition of certain of such export taxes, there can be no assurance that we will seek, or be able to obtain, reimbursement or setoff.

We are subject to and incur capital and operating costs to comply with, numerous foreign, U.S. federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing employee health and safety, the composition of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the usage and availability of water, the cleanup of contaminated properties and the reclamation of our mines, brine extraction operations and certain other assets at the end of their useful life. 
Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under the European Community Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). REACH imposes obligations on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Additionally, substances of high concern, as defined under REACH, are subject to an authorization process. Authorization may result in restrictions in the use of products by application or even in banning of the product. REACH regulations impose significant additional responsibilities and costs on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. Our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the European Union may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products that are not regulated by REACH, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH regulations. 
In June 2016, modifications to the Toxic Substances Control Act in the U.S. were signed into law, requiring chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation. Other pending initiatives potentially will require toxicological testing and risk assessments of a wide variety of chemicals, including chemicals used or produced by us. These initiatives include the Voluntary Children’s Chemical Evaluation Program, and High Production Volume Chemical Initiative in the U.S., as well as new initiatives in Asia and other regions. These assessments may result in heightened concerns about the chemicals involved and additional requirements being placed on the production, handling, labeling or use of the subject chemicals. Such concerns and additional requirements could also increase the cost incurred by our customers to use our chemical products and otherwise limit the use of these products, which could lead to a decrease in demand for these products. 
Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances and wastes, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally. Such liabilities may be imposed on entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and wastes, entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances and wastes at the affected property, and entities that currently own or operate such property. Our Bessemer City, North Carolina facility is currently undergoing investigation and remediation of contamination pursuant to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B corrective action permit. In addition, we currently have, and may in the future incur, liability as a potentially responsible party with respect to third party locations under CERCLA or state and foreign equivalents, including potential joint and several liability requiring us to pay in excess of our pro rata share of remediation costs. 
We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations and may become subject to claims and substantial liability for personal injury, property damage, wrongful death, loss of production, pollution and other environmental damages relating to the release of such substances into the environment. In addition, some of our current properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes, which could contain currently unknown contamination that could expose us to governmental requirements or claims relating to environmental remediation, personal injury and/or property damage. Depending on the frequency and severity of such incidents, it is possible that the Company’s revenues, operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators could be impaired. 
We record accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that new information or future developments could require us to reassess our potential exposure related to environmental matters. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in order to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws, regulations and orders of regulatory agencies, as well as claims for damages to property and the environment or injuries to employees and other persons resulting from our current or past operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future.
