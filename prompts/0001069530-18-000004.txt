Reverse Stock Split
 ﻿
 On May 4, 2017, following stockholder approval, our board of directors approved a reverse stock split at a ratio of 7-for-1. On May 4, 2017, we filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect the 7-for-1 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. The number of outstanding shares of common stock on the date of the reverse split was reduced from 46.1 million to 6.6 million shares. Our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opened for trading on May 10, 2017. As a result, all common stock share amounts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively reduced by a factor of seven, and all common stock per share amounts have been increased by a factor of seven, with the exception of our common stock par value.
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our pipeline of drug assets:
 ﻿
 REMOXY ER (extended-release oxycodone capsules CII) – REMOXY, our lead drug candidate, is a proprietary abuse-deterrent, twice-daily, oral oxycodone to treat severe chronic pain.  We plan to resubmit the REMOXY NDA to the FDA, with Priority Review in Q1 2018. We own exclusive rights to develop and commercialize REMOXY worldwide, with a sales royalty obligation to one of our technology partners.
 ﻿
 FENROCK™ (transdermal fentanyl patch CII) – FENROCK is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent fentanyl skin patch to treat severe pain. This is an early-stage program that is substantially funded by a competitive research grant award from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the primary agency of the U.S. government for research on drug abuse. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to FENROCK, with no royalty obligations to any third party.
     PTI-125 – PTI-125 is a proprietary small molecule drug for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  In 2017, we completed a first-in-human Phase I study with PTI-125.  This program is substantially funded by competitive research grant awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the primary agency of the U.S. government for biomedical research. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125, with no royalty obligations to any third party.
 ﻿
 PTI-125DX – PTI-125 is a proprietary, blood-based diagnostic/biomarker to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  This clinical-stage program is substantially funded by competitive research grant awards from the NIH. We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125DX, with no royalty obligations to any third party.
 ﻿
 REMOXY ER - a drug candidate for severe chronic pain
 ﻿
 Our lead drug candidate is called REMOXY ER (extended-release).  REMOXY is a proprietary, abuse-deterrent, twice-daily, capsule formulation of oral oxycodone, a strong opioid drug.  REMOXY is intended to meet the needs of healthcare professionals who appropriately prescribe extended-release oxycodone and who seek to minimize the risks of drug diversion, abuse or accidental patient misuse.  In particular, REMOXY’s thick, sticky, high viscosity formulation may deter unapproved routes of drug administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking.  The proposed indication for REMOXY is for "the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate."
 ﻿
 We own exclusive, worldwide rights to REMOXY. 
 ﻿
 Opioid drugs, such as oxycodone, are an important treatment option for patients with severe chronic pain. However, misuse, abuse and diversion of these prescription drugs remains a serious, persistent problem.  For over a decade, we have pioneered technology, tools and techniques that enable the development of Abuse-Deterrent Formulations (ADFs). ADFs are intended to make opioid drugs difficult to abuse yet provide steady pain relief when used appropriately by patients. ADFs are intended to help in the fight against prescription drug abuse.
 ﻿
 In March 2016, we resubmitted to the FDA a New Drug Application (NDA) for REMOXY.  In September 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA for the REMOXY NDA. The CRL informed us that REMOXY could not be approved in its present form and specified additional actions and data needed for drug approval. The CRL substantially focused on the need to conduct a clinical abuse-deterrent study via the nasal route of administration, and additional in vitro (non-clinical) studies to further characterize the abuse-deterrent properties of REMOXY.  The 2016 CRL

made no mention of clinical safety, drug efficacy, manufacturing, stability, bioequivalence or any other issues from a prior CRL.    ﻿
 In February 2017, we met with the FDA regarding REMOXY.  During this meeting, we reached written agreement with the FDA on a roadmap to resubmit the NDA for REMOXY.  Final minutes of our FDA meeting confirmed two key requirements needed for the resubmission of the REMOXY NDA: 

· | To support a potential drug label claim against abuse by injection: Repeat an injectability/syringeability study using thin films of drug, smaller volumes of solvents, additional mixed solvents and alternative extraction methods and syringe filter.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | To support a potential drug label claim against abuse by snorting: Conduct an intranasal abuse potential study in human volunteers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 During 2017, we conducted these mandated studies with REMOXY.  We believe positive results from these studies support label claims against abuse by injection and abuse by snorting.  In November 2017, we concluded a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.  The purpose of this pre-NDA meeting was to agree on submission requirements for the REMOXY NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.   During the pre-NDA meeting, we received comments and clarification from the FDA on the acceptability of the data to be included in the REMOXY NDA resubmission, including a recent intranasal study.  All questions were addressed and summarized in official minutes of the meeting issued by the FDA.  There are no discrepancies or requests for clarifications following receipt of final meeting minutes.  
 ﻿
 As a result, we intend to resubmit the REMOXY NDA in Q1 2018 with Priority (six-month) Review.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Background on Uses and Abuse of Opioid Drugs
 ﻿
 Opioid drugs are primarily used to relieve pain. They are among the world’s oldest known drugs. The term ‘opioid’ refers to an entire class of analgesic substances that are derived from the opium poppy plant. Drugs that fall within this class include oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, heroin, morphine and many other related substances. 
 ﻿
 In recent decades, oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opium derivative, has become a standard of care to treat severe chronic pain. Oxycodone is in Schedule II of the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which means it has accepted medical use with severe restrictions, a high potential for abuse and regulations around its manufacture, possession, storage, use and distribution.
 ﻿
 Oxycodone can provide significant therapeutic benefits for patients in pain when used as prescribed. In recent years, patients with severe chronic pain have benefited from oxycodone in long-acting formulations. Long-acting formulations contain a very high dose of oxycodone that is intended to release evenly over 12 hours. Long-acting oxycodone offers the convenience of less-frequent dosing intervals and improved compliance, a potential win-win for prescribers and for patients with severe chronic pain.
 ﻿
 However, the emergence of long-acting oxycodone has also corresponded with a dramatic increase in opioid drug abuse. Drug abuse is the use of opioid drugs for reasons other than what the drug was prescribed for, and often via unapproved routes of administration, such as injection, snorting or smoking. Opioids such as oxycodone are primarily abused due to their ability to produce a strong, if fleeting, euphoric high.
 ﻿
 Drug abusers have learned effective ways to tamper with, and defeat, long-acting oxycodone formulations. Defeating the long-acting properties of an oxycodone formulation can be as easy as crushing or grinding tablets, then swallowing, injecting, snorting or smoking the crushed substance. This release high levels of oxycodone faster than intended (called “dose-dumping”), resulting in an immediate and powerful euphoric high, as compared to swallowing an intact tablet as prescribed.
 ﻿
 Misuse of oxycodone is not always intentional.  According to a medical publication, about two-thirds of surveyed patients with chronic pain did not think that cutting, crushing, or grinding their medication would change the way it worked (Pergolizzi et al., 2014).
 ﻿

In addition, the pain-relieving effects of OxyContin® (oxycodone HCI), a widely used abuse-deterrent extended-release formulation of oxycodone, often wears off early, according to a lengthy investigation published by the Los Angeles Times in 2016.  The Los Angeles Times investigation reports that a single dose of twice-daily oxycodone often does not last for the intended 12 hours and performs more like “an 8-hour drug.”  This makes some patients take extra doses or stronger ones, raising the risk of abuse and addiction.  An additional problem for physicians and patients alike can arise when insurance plans will not reimburse, and pharmacists will not dispense, more than two doses of OxyContin per day.
 ﻿
 Opioid abuse is extremely dangerous. Opioid abuse can lead to drug-seeking behavior, tolerance and physical or psychological dependence. Even a single episode of opioid abuse can also lead to overdose, respiratory depression or death.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 The Role of Abuse-deterrent Formulations 
 ﻿
 Policy makers have developed a multi-pronged approach aimed at combating opioid misuse, abuse and addiction. One targeted effort has been to encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop ADFs.  In April 2015, the FDA issued a final guidance to assist the pharmaceutical industry in developing ADF opioid drug products.
 ﻿
 ADFs attempt to raise the bar on opioid abuse by making it more difficult, longer or aversive to tamper with a long-acting formulation, while recognizing that no drug or drug formulation can be made abuse-proof. In particular, an ADF drug can still be misused and result in overdose simply by ingesting the drug in higher than recommended doses. ADFs are not designed to prevent opioid-induced euphoria. ADF technology aims to decrease the likelihood that a long-acting opioid formulation will dose-dump under conditions of abuse or accidental misuse. By mitigating dose-dumping, the likelihood of overdose and death associated may decrease.
 ﻿
 The intention of ADFs is to displace non-abuse-deterrent drug products.   First-generation ADFs were introduced into the marketplace in 2010. However, we believe the relative weakness of first generation ADFs means opioid abuse continues to be a serious public health issue. In 2016, over 64,000 people died in the United States from opioid overdose, increasing from over 33,000 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control Prevention. According to the FDA, “for each death [due to narcotic pain relievers], there are an additional ten treatment admissions, 32 emergency department visits and 825 nonmedical users of these drugs.” (Source: FDA’s Efforts to Address the Misuse and Abuse of Opioids, 2/6/2013).
 ﻿
 As a pioneer in the design and development of ADFs, we believe a robust design for a novel ADF for twice-daily oxycodone revolves around four basic objectives: (i) safety and clinical efficacy over the entire 12-hours when used as prescribed; ii) abuse-deterrent when abused; (iii) ease of large scale manufacturing; and (iv) novel, non-infringing intellectual property. Many ADF programs may achieve three of these four objectives but the practical reality is that few ADFs achieve all four. We believe this is reflected in the industry’s relatively high failure rate with regards to ADFs developments for long-acting opioid formulations.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Market Opportunity for REMOXY ER
 ﻿
 REMOXY targets the market for opioid therapy.  The global opioid market has been estimated by third-parties to be valued at nearly $35 billion in 2015.  North America dominates the global market, with about 60-65% market share, or about $20 billion.  We estimate extended‑release opioid drugs are an approximately $4 billion market in the United States.
 ﻿
 We believe REMOXY can capture a share of the approximately $4 billion market in the United States for extended‑release opioid drugs, including a portion of the existing multi-billion OxyContin (Purdue Pharma L.P.) franchise. OxyContin remains the largest selling extended‑release opioid in the United States by dollars.  Despite OxyContin’s commercial success, we believe the drug carries a stigma due to widespread, well-documented cases of abuse and overdose; the persistence of negative media reports around this drug; the magnitude of the opioid epidemic and the sheer number of deaths associated with this problem; and on-going legal actions against Purdue by government agencies and private parties. 
 ﻿
 In addition to targeting the oxycodone market, REMOXY targets the approximately 10-15 million additional prescriptions for non‑abuse‑deterrent extended‑release opioids annually in the United States. Many of these opioids include active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as morphine, that may be perceived as having greater side effects than oxycodone‑based formulations.

﻿
 Opioid prescriptions in the United States peaked in 2010 and have decreased each year through 2017.  The reasons for this erosion are complex, but center around the fact that opioid abuse remains a serious, pervasive and persistent problem for physicians and patients alike.  In particular, prescriptions for non-abuse deterrent opioids are likely to continue to drop significantly in the years ahead. 
 ﻿
 In addition, government actions serve to materially limit the market for opioid therapy to only those patients who have an appropriate need for such drugs.  For example, in response to an epidemic of opioid overdoses, in 2017 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) released important new clinical guidelines for physicians treating adult patients for chronic pain.  The CDC guidelines provide specific recommendations to clinicians about the appropriate prescribing of opioids to improve pain management and patient safety, including: “When opioids are started, the lowest possible effective dosage should be prescribed to reduce risks of opioid use disorder and overdose.” (Source: CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain).  We believe these and other actions will continue to restrict the approvability, use, promotion and distribution of opioid drugs in the United States, and may serve to eliminate the market for non‑abuse‑deterrent opioids.
 ﻿
 We own exclusive, worldwide rights to REMOXY. If approved and granted appropriate label claims, we believe REMOXY may have potential to distinguish itself from competitors with:
 ﻿

ü | best-in-class abuse-deterrent properties;
--+------------------------------------------


ü | true twice-daily dosing;
--+-------------------------


ü | lowest initial starting dose;
--+------------------------------


ü | minimal food effect;
--+---------------------


ü | lack of generic drug substitution; and
--+---------------------------------------


ü | over 15 years of intellectual property protection.
--+---------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We believe direct competitors to REMOXY will include the two ADFs of twice-daily oxycodone that are commercially available in the United States:

· | OxyContin ER (oxycodone HCI) from Purdue Pharma L.P. - A reformulated version of the original OxyContin OC, this drug received FDA approval in April 2010. According to its package insert, "OxyContin is formulated with inactive ingredients intended to make the tablet more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse." Some patients have complained that the new formulation is not as effective or causes gastrointestinal problems, according to Pain News Network (2016). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Xtampza® ER (oxycodone) from Collegium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Xtampza ER received FDA approved in April 2016 and is available in capsules containing microspheres formulated with oxycodone base and inactive ingredients that make the formulation more difficult to manipulate for the purpose of abuse. Each capsule contains 9, 13.5, 18, 27, or 36 mg of oxycodone (equivalent to 10, 15, 20, 30 or 40 mg of oxycodone HCl, respectively). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 The FDA has approved two other extended-release, ADFs of oxycodone.  However, neither of these two drugs were ever launched into the marketplace in the United States: a) in 2016, the FDA approved Troxyca® ER (Pfizer, Inc), a capsule combination of oxycodone HCL and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist; and b) in 2014, the FDA approved Targiniq® ER (Purdue Pharma LP), a tablet combination of oxycodone HCL and naloxone, an opioid antagonist.  
 ﻿
 REMOXY will compete against all extended‑release opioids, including generic drug products.  In November 2017, the FDA issued final guidance on the regulatory pathway for generic abuse‑deterrent opioid products.  Among other requirements, the new FDA guidance emphasizes that sponsors of generic abuse-deterrent oxycodone must ensure that a generic opioid drug is no less abuse deterrent than the original opioid and must also evaluate all potential routes of abuse, even those routes of abuse for which a generic sponsor does not seek a label-claim. We believe these new FDA requirements represents a high bar for generic drug developers in terms of added development time, expenses, technical expertise and regulatory risks.  
 ﻿
 Currently we have no capability to launch or to commercialize REMOXY. We continue to review potential launch and commercialization strategies for REMOXY.  Options include a potential strategic transaction around all of our drug candidates; a commercial collaboration for REMOXY; or establishing commercial capabilities in-house to launch REMOXY on our own.

Chronology of REMOXY ER
 ﻿
 We initiated the development of REMOXY over a decade ago, before any formal guidance was in place with regards to regulatory pathways for ADFs. As a result of our pioneering efforts with REMOXY, we have developed a foundation of practical and scientific experience with regard to regulatory and development pathways for ADFs. 
 ﻿
 The following is a top-line reverse chronology of the development of REMOXY:

· | As a result of our pre-NDA meeting, we intend to resubmit the REMOXY NDA to the FDA in Q1 2018 with Priority (six-month) Review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In November 2017, we concluded a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2017, we met with the FDA regarding REMOXY.
--+--------------------------------------------------------


· | In September 2016, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for REMOXY.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In March 2016, we resubmitted the NDA for REMOXY with the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2015, we generated additional abuse-deterrent data, continued an on-going stability study and made other preparations necessary to resubmit the NDA for REMOXY with the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2015, we and Pfizer concluded the transfer of the REMOXY program. We believe Pfizer has transferred to us its data, materials, capital equipment and other assets related to REMOXY.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2014, Pfizer provided us with written notice of termination of its development of REMOXY. We and Pfizer agreed on an orderly transfer of all rights, data, IP, etc.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | From 2011-2014, Pfizer conducted fundamental investigations of the REMOXY formulation and its manufacture. As a result, Pfizer modified the REMOXY formulation and conducted successful studies to establish bioequivalence of the current formulation to the original formulation of REMOXY, to generate additional abuse-deterrent data and to provide manufacturing stability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2011, Pfizer received a CRL on the REMOXY NDA filed by King. Once again, FDA cited manufacturing issues (specifically, in vitro drug stability). Once again, the CRL did not question REMOXY’s safety, clinical efficacy, abuse-deterrent properties or use of the reference listed drug.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2010, King resubmitted the REMOXY NDA with the FDA. In early 2011, Pfizer acquired King. References to Pfizer include references to Pfizer’s subsidiary King.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2009, King assumed sole control and responsibility for REMOXY.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2008, we filed an NDA for REMOXY with the FDA. Later that year, we received a CRL over manufacturing issues (specifically, in vitro drug stability). However, the CRL did not question REMOXY’s safety, clinical efficacy, abuse-deterrent properties or use of the reference listed drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2005, we and King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or King, entered into an exclusive agreement to develop and commercialize REMOXY.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In 2003, we filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for REMOXY with the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FENROCK™ - a drug candidate for severe pain
 ﻿
 FENROCK is a proprietary transdermal patch that contains the prescription drug fentanyl to manage pain and incorporates novel abuse-deterrent technology.  This is an early-stage, pre-IND program that is substantially funded by a competitive research grant award from the NIH’s NIDA.
 ﻿
 Fentanyl is an opioid drug that is up to 100 times more potent than morphine. When used properly by patients under the care of a qualified physician, a fentanyl patch releases the drug slowly over 72 hours. This helps to manage pain that is severe enough to require daily around-the-clock, long-term treatment. However, fentanyl is also abused by non-patients for its euphoric effects. Abusers can chew on a fentanyl patch, or simply extract the fentanyl from a patch, then inject or ingest the contents. This practice is illicit and highly dangerous. It can quickly introduce into the body a massive amount of fentanyl, which can lead to addiction, overdose and death.

﻿
 In November 2017, we announced a research and development grant from NIDA following a competitive, in-depth evaluation of FENROCK technology for scientific and technical merit.  The grant of approximately $2.2 million provides us with funding to develop FENROCK.
 ﻿
 We developed in-house the technology for FENROCK and own all development and commercial rights, without royalty or milestone obligations to any third-parties. 
 ﻿
 Fentanyl is a schedule II substance under the U.S. Controlled Substance Act. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 PTI-125 - a drug candidate to treat Alzheimer’s Disease
 ﻿
 PTI-125 is a proprietary, experimental drug for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  AD is a progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.  Damage to the brain starts a decade or more before problems appear.  During this early stage of disease, people seem to be symptom-free, but toxic changes are taking place in the brain.  Eventually, brain damage becomes widespread and affected people are often unable to care for themselves.  Currently, AD cannot be detected until symptoms appear.  Over five million Americans live with AD, a number that is expected to increase significantly in the coming years.
 ﻿
 PTI-125 is a small molecule drug candidate that was designed by us and characterized by outside collaborators.  PTI-125 has been shown to significantly improve AD neuropathologies in mouse models of the disease and in post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients, including receptor dysfunctions, neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, insulin resistance and plaques and tangles that are hallmarks of AD. 
 ﻿
 PTI-125 works by binding to filamin A (FLNA), a protein critical to beta amyloid’s toxicity.  Beta amyloid exerts multiple toxic effects, eventually causing the plaques and tangles found in the brains of people with AD.  By binding to FLNA, PTI-125 may prevents and even reverse amyloid-related AD damage.
 ﻿
 To date, the underlying science for PTI-125 has been published in Journal of Neuroscience, Neurobiology of Aging, Journal of Biological Chemistry, PLOS-One and other peer-reviewed scientific journals.
 ﻿
 In June 2017, we announced that the NIH's National Institute on Aging awarded us a $1.7 million research grant following a competitive, in-depth evaluation of PTI-125 for scientific and technical merit.  This NIH research grant enabled us to begin testing PTI-125 in human subjects.  Subsequently, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for PTI-125 was submitted and accepted by the FDA.
 ﻿
 In October 2017, we announced the successful completion of a Phase I clinical study for PTI-125.  This study investigated for the first time the safety, dosing and pharmacokinetic profile of PTI-125 in healthy human volunteers.
 ﻿
 In this first-in-human study, PTI-125 was evaluated in 24 healthy human volunteers in a single-site in the United States for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics.  Study subjects were administered a single oral dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg of PTI-125.  The drug was well-tolerated in all subjects.  Importantly, PTI-125 showed no treatment-related adverse effects and no dose-limiting safety findings.  Pharmacokinetic measurements showed PTI-125, a small molecule, was rapidly absorbed.  Dose-proportionality outcomes were observed over the entire dose range of 50 to 200 mg.  There were two key findings for this Phase I Study:

· | PTI-125 was safe and well-tolerated at all doses studied; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | PTI-125 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics for further drug development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Given the absence of dose-limiting effects in healthy adults, an excellent non-clinical safety database, a strong scientific rationale, and multiple peer-reviewed publications and research grant awards, we believe there is significant merit to move this drug program to the next level of development.
 ﻿
 We own exclusive, worldwide rights to PTI-125, with no royalty obligations to any third party.

﻿
 PTI-125DX - a blood-based diagnostic to detect Alzheimer’s Disease
 ﻿
 We are developing innovative technology to diagnose AD with a simple blood test.  We believe finding a way to diagnose AD at an early-stage is vitally important.  A blood test may help detect AD before symptoms occur, or rule out other possible causes of memory problems, or might be used as a biomarker to measure the efficacy of drug candidates during clinical trials, or to define new potential therapies for AD.
 ﻿
 Our diagnostic technology is related to PTI-125, our clinical-stage drug candidate for AD, whose underlying science has been published in Journal of Neuroscience, Neurobiology of Aging, Journal of Biological Chemistry, PLOS-One and other peer-reviewed scientific journals.  PTI-125DX is not a genetic based assay, nor does it rely on neuroimaging markers.  PTI-125DX highlights critical changes that occur in the brain by detecting biochemical markers that are found in blood during the course of the disease.  
 ﻿
 The PTI-125DX assay is relatively quick, easy, non-hazardous and inexpensive, and can be repeated as necessary without contraindications.  If successful, we believe the data generated by PTI-125DX can be used by clinicians or algorithms to classify patients at different stages of AD and/or to distinguish AD from other related diseases with better specificity or reliability than current methodologies.
 ﻿
 PTI-125DX is an early-stage program.  We have generated data from hundreds of blood samples using PTI-125DX.  Results have not been published to date in order to better protect the intellectual property around this technology.
 ﻿
 In September 2017, we announced a $1.8 million research grant from the NIH for PTI-125DX.  The NIH's National Institute on Aging awarded us this research grant following a confidential, competitive and in-depth evaluation of PTI-125DX technology for scientific and technical merit. The research grant is a technical-milestone based award that will enable us to work collaboratively with leaders in the field to develop and test on clinical samples a blood-based diagnostic for AD.  
 ﻿
 PTI-125DX was designed by us and characterized by outside collaborators.  We own worldwide commercial rights to PTI-125DX and related technology, without royalty or milestone obligations to any third parties.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Strategy
 ﻿
 Our corporate strategy has changed little over the years: to spend carefully but to keep innovation at the top of our agenda.  Elements of our corporate strategy include:
 ﻿
 Focus on Clinical Development Stage Products. We believe this focus will enable us to generate product revenues earlier than if we were focused on early-stage research and discovery activities.
     Retain Significant Rights to Our Drugs. We currently retain worldwide commercialization rights to all of our technology and drug candidates in all markets and indications, including REMOXY. In general, we intend to independently develop our drug candidates through late-stage clinical trials.
     Outsource Key Functions. We intend to continue to outsource preclinical studies, clinical trials and formulation and manufacturing activities. We believe outsourcing permits significant time savings and allows for more efficient deployment of our resources.
 ﻿
 We also conduct basic research and development in collaboration with academic and other partners. Our research and development expenses were $7.6 million and $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional details regarding our research and development activities.

Our Intellectual Property
 ﻿
 The protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license is critical to our success and competitive position. We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents covering our products and technology. We consider the overall protection of our patents and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. 
 ﻿
 We seek to protect our technology by, among other methods, filing and prosecuting U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications with respect to our technology and products and their uses. The focus of our patent strategy is to secure and maintain intellectual property rights to technology for the following categories of our business:

· | the technology that forms the basis of REMOXY and FENROCK, our other abuse-deterrent drug candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the technologies related to PTI-125 and PTI-125DX product candidates; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the manufacture and use of our product candidates.
--+---------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable. We protect our proprietary information, in part, by the use of confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain of our contractors.
 ﻿
 We plan to prosecute and defend our patent applications, allowed patents, issued patents and proprietary information. Our competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in large part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property from challenges and to enforce our patent rights against potential infringements.

Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of corresponding patent applications. Our patents and the patents we license from third parties include the following issued U.S. Patents:  8,168,217; 8,153,152; 8,147,870; 8,133,507; 8,354,124; 8,415,401; 8,420,120; 8,974,821; 8,945,614; 8,951,556; 9,233,160; 9,517,271; 9,555,113; 9,592,204; 9,855,333; and 9,572,885. 
 ﻿
 Our issued U.S. patent for REMOXY with the longest patent term extends to March 2034. Outside the United States, our granted patent with the longest patent term for REMOXY extends to 2028. Patents may have their term extended for various reasons including the grant of patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, or supplemental protection certificates, or may have their term shortened for various reasons including by terminal disclaimers. Certain United States patent applications and patent applications outside the United states are pending.
 ﻿
 In addition, we use a unique and complex process to manufacture REMOXY. We also protect as trade secrets the significant pharmaceutical know-how and detailed knowledge of a complex supply chain to manufacture REMOXY.
 ﻿
 REMOXY, REMOXY ER and FENROCK are trademarks of Pain Therapeutics, Inc.

 ﻿
 Formulation Agreement with Durect Corporation
 ﻿
 We have an exclusive, worldwide Development and License Agreement, or the Durect Agreement, with Durect to use a patented controlled-release technology that forms the basis for REMOXY.
 ﻿
 Under the terms of the Durect Agreement, we are solely responsible for clinical development, Durect is responsible for furnishing suitable laboratory facilities, equipment and personnel during pre-clinical phases of development and we and Durect are jointly responsible for certain pre-clinical activities.  We reimburse Durect’s expenses and have made milestone payments based on the achievement of certain clinical or regulatory milestones. We paid Durect approximately $40.4 million from the inception of the Durect Agreement to December 31, 2017. We could pay another $1.5 million milestone payment to Durect under the Durect Agreement.
 ﻿
 We are obligated to pay Durect royalties on commercial sales of REMOXY. These royalties range from 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales, depending on the volume of sales of REMOXY in a given calendar year.  There are no minimum payments, and the royalty rate resets back to 6.0% at the beginning of each calendar year.
 ﻿


     
12

The Durect Agreement terminates on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed under such agreement or a certain number of years following first commercial sale in such country. Currently, the last to expire patent covered by such agreement expires in 2034. However, such date may be extended by the issuance of any additional patents pursuant to pending patent applications. We can terminate the Durect Agreement with notice to Durect, and we and Durect can terminate such agreement under certain circumstances, including material breach and insolvency. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Prior Agreements with Pfizer 
 ﻿
 Between 2005 and 2014, Pfizer paid us a total of $290 million, including $155 million in upfront fees, $30 million in milestone payments and $105 million to reimburse expenses we incurred under the agreements we had with Pfizer. Pfizer has no further obligations to us. We have no further obligations to Pfizer, except that we will owe Pfizer a one-time payment of $200,000, payable at the time REMOXY is approved by the FDA, related to certain commercial manufacturing equipment we purchased from Pfizer.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Manufacturing
 ﻿
 We do not own or lease any manufacturing facilities. We outsource formulation, manufacturing and related activities to third parties.    ﻿
 Our suppliers must comply with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, enforced by the FDA and other government agencies such as the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. Our suppliers are subject to unannounced inspection by regulators, including pre-approval inspections by the FDA and the DEA, to ensure they are in strict compliance with government regulations and standards. Our suppliers may be forced to stop producing, storing, shipping or testing our drug products if they fall out of compliance with government regulations and standards. 
 ﻿
 We have no control over our suppliers’ compliance, or lack thereof, with the multitude of regulations and standards that affect our drug products. We cannot control decisions by our suppliers that affect their ability or willingness to continue to supply us on acceptable terms, or at all.    ﻿
 We may not be able to replace a commercial supplier on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Replacing any of our commercial suppliers will be expensive and time consuming. Further, if REMOXY is approved, our commercial suppliers may encounter difficulties in achieving high volumes of production to satisfy commercial demands. Failure by any of our suppliers to perform as expected could delay or prevent commercialization of REMOXY or result in shortages, cost overruns, or other problems and would materially harm our business.
 ﻿
 Commercial supply of certain excipients from Durect
 ﻿
 We will rely on Durect as the sole source of certain excipients in REMOXY. Durect has limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products and maintaining GMP-compliant operations. A Pre-Approval Inspection, or PAI, by the FDA officials is often integral to the FDA approval process. A PAI is an unannounced evaluation of a manufacturing or test site for readiness for commercial scale manufacturing, conformance with commitments made in an NDA and data integrity. To our knowledge, the FDA has never conducted a PAI of any Durect facility.  We do not and cannot know whether Durect’s manufacturing or test facilities could pass a PAI inspection related to REMOXY, or whether Durect has invested in the necessary systems to pass a PAI inspection. 
 ﻿
 We rely on Durect to supply to us certain excipients for the REMOXY formulation. Under the Durect Agreement, these excipients are supplied to us at Durect’s cost, plus thirty (30) percent. We currently do not have a long-term commercial supply agreement in place with Durect. We expect that we and Durect will negotiate a supply agreement for these excipients. We may not be able to establish a commercial supply agreement on acceptable terms. Until a commercial supply agreement is in place with Durect, we expect to obtain excipients from Durect via individual purchase orders. 
 ﻿
 If we receive marketing approval for REMOXY, Durect may need to materially expand its manufacturing capacity. Durect may not be able to increase its manufacturing capacity for REMOXY in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Moreover, 

     
13

significant scale up of manufacturing will require additional validation studies, which are subject to the FDA review and approval. 
 ﻿
 Commercial supply of oxycodone with Noramco
 ﻿
 We expect to rely on Noramco as the sole source of the oxycodone base used in REMOXY. We currently do not have a long-term commercial supply agreement in place with Noramco. We expect to negotiate with Noramco a commercial supply agreement to supply us with oxycodone base. We may not be able to establish a commercial supply agreement on acceptable terms, or at all. Until we have a commercial supply agreement in place with Noramco, we expect to obtain oxycodone base from Noramco via individual purchase orders. 
 ﻿
 Commercial drug supply agreement with Mallinckrodt
 ﻿
 Our sole supplier for commercial supplies of REMOXY is Mallinkcrodt Pharmaceuticals, or Mallinckrodt. In October 2007, we and Mallinckrodt entered into a long-term supply agreement, or the Mallinckrodt Agreement when Pfizer was responsible for commercialization of REMOXY. Pfizer assigned the Mallinckrodt Agreement to us upon the termination of the Pfizer Agreements. In March 2010, we and Mallinckrodt entered into an amended and restated long-term supply agreement.  In a letter dated February 21, 2017, Mallinckrodt alleged a breach of contract because REMOXY had not yet been approved by the FDA. However, since then we and Mallinkcrodt have continued to work towards the approvability of REMOXY and commercial readiness.  We continue to rely on our agreement with Mallinkcrodt to move forward with the REMOXY program.
 ﻿
 We expect to continue to rely on Mallinckrodt as the sole-source drug product manufacturer of REMOXY pursuant to the Mallinckrodt Agreement. In addition to drug product manufacturing, Mallinckrodt is responsible for sourcing excipients in REMOXY other than those provided by the Durect Agreement.
 ﻿
 Commercial manufacturing and supply agreements
 ﻿
 We will rely on third parties to conduct certain quality control and assurance testing, shipping or storage of REMOXY.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Government Regulation
 ﻿
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and in our ongoing research and development activities. All of our products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the United States, various federal, and in some cases state, statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of our products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require us to spend substantial resources. Regulatory approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed. Further, approved drugs, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products that may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. 
 ﻿
 Applicable FDA regulations require the filing of an NDA or a Biologic License Application, or BLA and approval by the FDA prior to commercialization of any of our drug candidates in the United States.
 ﻿
 The Drug Approval Process
 ﻿
 We will be required to complete several activities before we can market any of our drug candidates for human use in the United States, including:
 ﻿

· | preclinical studies;
--+---------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
     
14


· | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------


· | FDA approval of the NDA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety of the product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with the FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practice. We submitted the results of preclinical tests to the FDA as part of our INDs prior to commencing clinical trials. We may be required to conduct additional toxicology studies.
 ﻿
 Based on preclinical testing, an IND is filed with the FDA to begin human testing of the drug in the United States. The IND becomes effective if not rejected by the FDA within 30 days. The IND must indicate the results of previous experiments, how, where and by whom the new clinical trials will be conducted, the chemical structure of the compound, the method by which it is believed to work in the human body, any toxic effects of the compound found in the animal studies and how the compound is manufactured. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. In addition, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, generally comprised of physicians at the hospital or clinic where the proposed clinical trials will be conducted, must review and approve the IND. The IRB also continues to monitor the clinical trial. We must submit progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials to the FDA at least annually. In addition, the FDA may, at any time during the 30-day period or at any time thereafter, impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials under the IND cannot commence or recommence without the FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. An FDA imposed clinical hold on an IND application can result in substantial delay and large, unforeseen expenses, and it may cancel the viability of developing a new drug candidate in the United States.
 ﻿
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase I clinical trials typically study a drug’s safety profile and may include the safe dosage range. Phase I clinical trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body, and the duration of its action. In addition, we may, to the extent feasible, assess early indicators of a drug’s efficacy in our Phase I clinical trials. In Phase II clinical trials, controlled studies are conducted on volunteer patients with the targeted disease or condition. The primary purpose of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on the volunteer patients as well as to determine a drug’s side effect profile. These clinical trials may be conducted concurrently with Phase I clinical trials. In addition, Phase I/II clinical trials may be conducted to evaluate not only the efficacy of the drug on the patient population, but also its safety. During Phase III clinical trials, the drug is studied in an expanded patient population and in multiple sites. Physicians monitor the patients to determine efficacy and to observe and report adverse events that may result from use of the drug.
 ﻿
 Our clinical trials are designed to produce clinical information about how our drugs perform compared to placebo or compared to existing drugs where appropriate. We have designed most Phase II and Phase III clinical trials to date as randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging studies. A randomized clinical trial is one in which patients are randomly assigned to the various study treatment arms. A double-blind clinical trial is one in which the patient, the physician and our trial monitor are unaware if the patient is receiving placebo or study drug in order to preserve the integrity of the clinical trial and reduce bias. A placebo-controlled clinical trial is one in which a subset of patients is purposefully given inactive medication.
 ﻿
 We may not successfully complete Phase I, Phase II or Phase III clinical trials within any specified time period, or at all, with respect to any of our drug candidates. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time in response to concerns that participants are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 ﻿
 After the completion of clinical trials, if there is substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA is filed with the FDA. The NDA must contain all of the information on the drug gathered to that date, including data from the clinical trials. NDAs often exceed 100,000 pages in length.
 ﻿
 The FDA may request additional information before accepting an NDA. In such an event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and, again, is subject to review before filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA reviews the NDA and responds to the applicant. The review process is typically extended for significant amounts of time by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. 


     
15

﻿
 It is FDA policy to convene an expert Advisory Committee meeting during the review cycle for opioid drug products.  The purpose of an Advisory Committee is to provide third-party input on key regulatory decisions, including approval and labeling of abuse-deterrent products, and whether the totality of the data submitted by a sponsor is sufficient to support marketing approval in the United States and labeling of the product with claims on abuse-deterrence.  Advisory Committee meetings are non-binding, that is, the FDA is not legally bound to follow any recommendation, vote or input of an Advisory Committee on any matter. 
 ﻿
 If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue either a CRL indicating either an approval or may identify conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications. If the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA may refuse to approve the NDA or issue a not approvable letter.
 ﻿
 If the FDA approves the NDA, the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe. Periodic reports must be submitted to the FDA, including descriptions of any reported adverse reactions. The FDA may request additional post-marketing studies, or Phase IV clinical trials, to evaluate long-term effects of the approved drug.
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)    ﻿
 The FDA requires a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of the approval of an NDA or after approval to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA considers the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity.  If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a new drug, the drug sponsor must submit a proposed REMS plan as part of its NDA prior to approval. A REMS for a newly approved drug can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and Elements To Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the REMS approval. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. 
 ﻿
 The FDA has initiated efforts to develop a standardized REMS for opioid medications to ensure their safe use.  In July 2012, the FDA approved a class‑wide REMS for extended‑release formulations of oxycodone. Manufacturers subject to this class‑wide REMS must work together to implement the REMS as part of a single shared system to reduce the burden of the REMS on the healthcare system. The central component of the extended release/long acting opioid REMS program is an education program for prescribers and patients.  REMS include a Medication Guide available for distribution to patients who are dispensed the drug, as well as ETASU. ETASU include training for healthcare professionals who prescribe the drug; information provided to prescribers that they can use to educate patients in the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids; and information provided to prescribers of the existence of the REMS and the need to successfully complete the necessary training. Prescriber training required as part of the REMS is conducted by accredited, independent continuing education providers, without cost to healthcare professionals, under unrestricted grants funded by opioid analgesic manufacturers. Moreover, REMS assessments must be submitted on an annual basis to assess the extent to which ETASU are meeting the goals of the REMS and whether the goals or elements should be modified.  
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Advertising and Promotion    ﻿
 The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. Our lead drug candidate, REMOXY, cannot be commercially promoted before receiving FDA approval.  After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA 

     
16

regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject us to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject us to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute REMOXY. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Post‑Approval Requirements    ﻿
 Once an NDA is approved, REMOXY will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion restrictions. 
 ﻿
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post‑market testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration subjects entities to periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA or these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory actions may be taken, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 ﻿
 The FDA may require post‑approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments    ﻿
 Orange Book Listing    ﻿
 In seeking approval for REMOXY through an NDA, we will be required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the drug product. Upon approval of REMOXY, each of the patents listed in the application for this drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the “Orange Book”. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product. However, in November 2017, the FDA issued final guidance on the regulatory pathway for generic abuse‑deterrent opioid products.  Among other requirements, the new FDA guidance emphasizes that sponsors of generic abuse-deterrent oxycodone must ensure that a generic opioid drug is no less abuse deterrent than the original opioid and must also evaluate all potential routes of abuse, even those routes of abuse for which a generic sponsor does not seek a label-claim.  Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 ﻿
 The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not 

     
17

been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than make certifications concerning a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 ﻿
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 ﻿
 Exclusivity    ﻿
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA’s findings regarding that drug. A drug may obtain a three‑year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the supplement. 
 ﻿
 An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 ﻿
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs    ﻿
 Generally, drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on data not developed by the applicant, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application. 
 ﻿
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or provide additional materials to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 ﻿
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Therefore, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non‑patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can 

     
18

only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory approval. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three‑year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the NDA. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information    ﻿
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to post certain information regarding the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 DEA Regulatory Requirements
 ﻿
 Our lead drug candidate, REMOXY, is regulated as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA.  CSA establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging of REMOXY, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.  
 ﻿
 REMOXY, an abuse‑deterrent oral formulation of oxycodone, is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and use of the products is subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 
 ﻿
 Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 
 ﻿
 The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. 
 ﻿
 In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because REMOXY is regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance, it will be subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including oxycodone base for use in manufacturing REMOXY. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. 
 ﻿


     
19

To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings. In addition, individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 ﻿
 We may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state, and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Air Act, national restrictions on technology transfer, and import, export, and customs regulations.  It is possible that any portion of the regulatory framework under which we operate may change and that such change could have a negative impact on our current and anticipated operations.  Failure to comply with these requirements could result, among other things, in suspension of regulatory approval, recalls, injunctions or civil or criminal sanctions.

 Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement    ﻿
 The commercial success of REMOXY, if approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third‑party payors include governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for REMOXY in whole or in part if they determine that our drug product is not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third party payors attempt to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. 
 ﻿
 Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost‑containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for REMOXY to operate profitably. 
 ﻿
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to achieve market share at the expense of existing and established and future products in our target markets. Existing and future products, therapies, technological approaches or delivery systems will compete directly with REMOXY. Competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific indication, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. Companies that currently sell generic or proprietary opioid formulations in the United States may include, but are not limited to, Purdue Pharma, Collegium, Inc., Roxane Laboratories, Mylan, Abbott Laboratories, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Elkins-Sinn, Watson Laboratories, Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Pernix, Mallinckrodt, Eaglet Pharmaceuticals, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical and Forest Pharmaceuticals, as well as several generic companies.
 ﻿
 Alternative technologies are being developed to address the issue of abuse or misuse of opioid painkillers or increase opioid potency, as well as alternatives to opioid therapy for pain management, several of which are in clinical trials or are awaiting approval from the FDA.

We compete with fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have opioid drugs already approved by the FDA or in development and operate larger research and development programs in these fields than we do. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:

· | developing drugs;
--+------------------


· | undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | formulating and manufacturing drugs; and
--+-----------------------------------------


· | launching, marketing, distributing and selling drugs.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Developments by competitors may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or non-competitive. We also compete with these companies for qualified personnel and opportunities for product acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic alliances.
