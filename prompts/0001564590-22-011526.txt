Overview
 We are an in vitro diagnostics company and leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes. We are dedicated to improving patient care and reducing the cost of care by helping clinicians effectively treat patients faster than ever before. We have developed innovative products that offer a rapid, sensitive and simple alternative to existing diagnostic methodologies. We are developing a broad set of applications aimed at improving patient outcomes, reducing the cost of healthcare, and lowering mortality rates by helping medical professionals make earlier targeted treatment decisions. Our technology enables rapid detection of pathogens, biomarkers and other abnormalities in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, sputum and urine, and can detect cellular targets at limits of detection as low as one colony forming unit per milliliter, or CFU/mL. We are currently targeting a range of critically underserved healthcare conditions, focusing initially on those for which a rapid diagnosis will serve an important dual role – saving lives and reducing costs. Our current development efforts primarily target sepsis, which is an area of significant unmet medical need in which existing therapies could be more effective with improved diagnostics.
 Our primary commercial products include the T2Dx® Instrument, the T2Candida® Panel, the T2Bacteria® Panel, the T2Resistance® Panel, and the T2SARS-CoV-2™ Panel. 
 History
 In September 2014, we received marketing authorization from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our first two products, the T2Dx Instrument, or the T2Dx, and the T2Candida Panel, or T2Candida, which have the ability to rapidly identify the five most clinically relevant species of Candida, a fungal pathogen known to cause sepsis, directly from whole blood specimens. The T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida Panel were CE marked in the European Union, or EU, in July 2014.
 In May 2018, we received market clearance from the FDA for the T2Bacteria® Panel, or T2Bacteria, which runs on the T2Dx Instrument and has the ability to rapidly identify five of the most common and deadly sepsis-causing bacteria directly from whole blood specimens. The T2Bacteria Panel was CE marked in the EU in June 2017.
 In February 2019, our T2Resistance®™ Panel, or T2Resistance, was granted FDA Breakthrough Device designation and in November 2019, it was CE marked in the EU.
 In September 2019, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, awarded us a milestone-based contract, with an initial value of $6 million, and a potential value of up to $69 million, for the development of a next-generation diagnostic instrument, a comprehensive sepsis panel, and a multi-target biothreat panel. In September 2020, BARDA exercised the first contract option valued at $10.5 million. In April 2021, BARDA agreed to modify the contract to accelerate product development by advancing future deliverables, and adding a U.S. T2Resistance Panel into Option 1 of the BARDA contract. In September 2021, BARDA exercised Option 2A valued at approximately $6.4 million to further advance the new product development initiatives. In December 2021, we initiated the U.S. clinical trials for the T2Resistance and T2Biothreat Panels.
 In June 2020, we launched the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, our COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test, after validation of the test pursuant to the FDA’s policy permitting COVID-19 tests to be marketed prior to receipt of an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, subject to certain prerequisites. In August 2020, the FDA granted an EUA to the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel for the qualitative direct detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens (such as nasal, mid-turbinate, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swab specimens) and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. 
 Clinical Need
 Sepsis is the body’s overwhelming and life-threatening response to infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. It is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, claiming more lives annually than the top three cancers combined: lung, colorectal and breast cancer, and it is the most expensive hospital-treated condition. Most commonly afflicting immunocompromised, critical care, and elderly patients, sepsis is a severe inflammatory response to a bacterial or fungal infection with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Based on a 2020 study from the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, it was estimated that the annual cost of sepsis to the U.S. healthcare system was $62 billion. The rate of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis has increased by 40% from 2012 to 2018, the HHS study found. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, estimates that sepsis causes more than 270,000 American deaths per year. The most common cause of sepsis is bacterial, Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens, while Candida species are the most common cause of fungal sepsis. Early detection and identification of sepsis causing pathogens is critical for effective treatment and positive patient outcomes.
Today, sepsis-causing pathogens are typically detected through a series of blood cultures, post-blood culture species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. These methods have substantial limitations including the risk of false negative test results, a delay in administration of targeted antimicrobial treatment, and the incurrence of unnecessary hospital expense. According to a study published in the 
 2


Journal of Clinical Microbiology in 2010, targeted therapy for patients with bloodstream infections can be delayed up to 72 hours due to the wait time for blood culture results. In another study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2012, the delayed administration of appropriate antifungal therapy was associated with higher mortality among patients with septic shock attributed to Candida infection. 
 In addition, the Survey of Physicians’ Perspectives and Knowledge About Diagnostic Tests for Bloodstream Infections in 2015 reported that negative blood culture results are only trusted by 36% of those physicians. Without the ability to rapidly identify pathogens, physicians typically start treatment of at-risk patients with broad-spectrum antibiotics and switch therapies every 12 to 24 hours if a patient is not responding. These drugs, which can be costly, are often ineffective and unnecessary and have contributed to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The speed to getting the patient on the right targeted therapy is critical. According to a study published by Critical Care Medicine in 2006, in sepsis patients with documented hypotension, administration of effective antimicrobial therapy within the first hour of detection was associated with a survival rate of 79.9% and, over the ensuing six hours, each hour of delay in initiation of treatment was associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%. Candida is the fourth leading hospital-acquired bloodstream infection, afflicting more than 135,000 patients per year in the United States, and the most lethal form of common bloodstream infections that cause sepsis, with an average mortality rate of approximately 40%. This high mortality rate is largely due to a delay in providing targeted therapy to the patient due to the elapsed time from Candida infection to positive diagnosis. According to a study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the Candida mortality rate can be reduced to 11% with the initiation of targeted therapy within 12 hours of presentation of symptoms. Additionally, a typical patient with a Candida infection averages 40 days in the hospital, including nine days in intensive care, resulting in an average cost per hospital stay of more than $130,000 per patient. In a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, providing targeted antifungal therapy within 24 hours of the presentation of symptoms decreased the length of hospital stay by approximately ten days and decreased the average cost of care by approximately $30,000 per patient.
 In addition, due to the high mortality rate associated with Candida infections, physicians often will place patients on antifungal drugs while they await blood culture diagnostic results which generally take at least five days to generate a negative test result. Antifungal drugs are toxic and may result in side effects and can cost over $50 per day. The speed to result of T2Candida, coupled with higher sensitivity as compared to blood culture, may help reduce the overuse of ineffective, or even unnecessary, antimicrobial therapy which may reduce side effects for patients, lower hospital costs and potentially counteract the growing resistance to antifungal therapy. The administration of inappropriate therapy is a driving force behind the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, which the CDC called “one of our most serious health threats.” Currently, high risk patients are typically initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotic therapy that cover approximately 60% of patients with infections. Of the remaining 40% of patients, approximately 30% of the patients typically have a bacterial infection and 10% typically have Candida infections. T2Candida and T2Bacteria are designed to identify pathogens either resistant to, or not covered by, broad spectrum antibiotic therapy.

 T2Dx Instrument
 Our T2Dx Instrument, which is FDA-cleared for use with our T2Candida and T2Bacteria panels and CE marked in the EU for use with our T2Candida, T2Bacteria and T2Resistance Panels, is a fully automated, easy-to-use, bench-top instrument that is capable of running a broad range of diagnostic tests from patient samples, eliminating the need for manual workflow steps, such as pipetting, that can introduce risks of cross-contamination. To operate the system, a tube containing the patient’s sample is placed onto a disposable test cartridge, which is pre-loaded with all necessary reagents and consumables. The cartridge is then inserted into the T2Dx Instrument, which automatically processes the sample and then delivers a diagnostic test result. Test results are displayed on screen and can be printed or connected directly to the hospital or laboratory information system.
 The T2Dx Instrument eliminates the need for sample purification and analyte extraction often required by other diagnostic technologies, which increases sensitivity and specificity, enables a broad menu of tests to be run on a single platform, and greatly reduces the complexity of the consumables. The T2Dx Instrument incorporates a simple user interface and is designed to efficiently process up to seven specimens simultaneously.
 The commercially available test panels designed to run on the T2Dx Instrument are T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, and T2SARS-CoV-2, which are focused on identifying life-threatening pathogens associated with sepsis and COVID-19. 
 T2Candida
 Our T2Candida Panel, which is FDA-cleared in the U.S. and CE marked in the EU, is a direct-from-blood test that identifies the most lethal form of common blood stream infections that cause sepsis, candidemia, which has an average mortality rate of approximately 40%. T2Candida identifies five species of Candida, directly from certain human whole blood specimens, including Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis. These species account for 90% of Candida blood stream infections.
 According to a 2005 report published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the high mortality rate associated with Candida infection can be reduced to 11% with the initiation of targeted therapy within 12 hours of presentation of symptoms. Currently, a typical patient with a Candida infection averages 40 days in the hospital, including nine days in intensive care, resulting in an average cost per hospital stay of over $130,000 per patient. In a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in 2009, providing targeted 
 3


antifungal therapy within 24 hours of the presentation of symptoms decreased the length of hospital stay by approximately ten days and decreased the average cost of care by approximately $30,000 per patient. In addition, many hospitals initiate antifungal drugs, such as caspofungin or micafungin, while waiting for blood culture-based diagnostic results. We estimate this practice costs approximately $500 per patient and is currently in use for over 40% of high-risk patients on average and for all high-risk patients in some hospitals. A negative result from T2Candida can provide timely data allowing physicians to avoid unnecessary antifungal treatment and potentially reduce the treatment cost further. In 2014 we received FDA marketing authorization for the T2Candida Panel in the U.S. and in July 2014 the T2Candida Panel was CE marked in the EU.
 In our pivotal clinical trial for T2Candida, we demonstrated that it delivered results in as few as three hours, with an average time to result during the trial of 4.2 hours, compared to the average time to result of one to six or more days typically required for blood-culture-based diagnostics. We believe the speed of T2Candida will enable physicians to potentially make treatment decisions and administer targeted treatment to patients in 4 to 6 hours versus 24 to 144 hours for blood culture. In the pivotal clinical trial, the T2Candida Panel also demonstrated overall sensitivity of 91.1% and overall specificity of 99.4%. Furthermore, in April 2015, Future Microbiology published the results of an economic study regarding the use of T2Candida conducted by IMS Health, a healthcare economics agency. In that economic study, IMS demonstrated that an average hospital admitting 5,100 patients at risk for Candida infections could save approximately $5.8 million annually due to decreased hospital stays for patients, reduction in use of antifungal drugs and other associated savings. The economic study further showed T2Candida potentially reduced the costs of care by $26,887 per Candida patient and that rapid detection of Candida reduced patient deaths by 60.6%. Results from a data analysis of T2Candida for the detection and monitoring of Candida infection and sepsis were published comparing aggregated results from the use of T2Candida to blood culture-based diagnostics for the detection of invasive candidiasis and candidemia. The analysis included samples acquired from more than 1,900 patients. Out of 55 prospective patient cases that were tested with T2Candida and blood culture and determined to be positive or likely to be positive for a Candida infection, T2Candida detected 96.4% of the patients (53 cases) compared to detection of 60% of the patients (33 cases) with blood culture.
 We believe T2Candida can enable clinicians to administer the most effective therapy, faster, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. We further believe that the adoption of the T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida can decrease the high mortality rate of Candida infections because these products can enable clinicians to make earlier and more informed decisions by providing positive test results to direct therapy and negative test results to reduce the use of antifungal drugs.
 T2Bacteria
 Our T2Bacteria Panel, which is FDA-cleared in the U.S. and CE marked in the EU, is a direct-from-blood test that detects certain bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis that are frequently not covered by first-line antibiotics, often referred to as the “ESKAPE pathogens.” The T2Bacteria Panel is designed for the detection of most of the ESKAPE pathogens from human whole blood specimens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and the CE marked T2Bacteria Panel in addition identifies a sixth species, Acinetobacter baumannii, with a positive percent agreement ranging from 81.3% to 100% and the negative percent agreement ranging from 95.0% to 100.0%. The ESKAPE pathogens are responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections and are often capable of “escaping” the biocidal action of antimicrobial agents, exhibiting multidrug resistance and virulence. These pathogens cause over 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths per year. In the pivotal clinical trial the T2Bacteria Panel also demonstrated overall sensitivity of 90% and overall specificity of 98%.
 A systematic review of the clinical and economic impact of antibiotic resistance reveals that the ESKAPE pathogens are associated with the highest risk of mortality, thereby resulting in increased health care costs. In the T2Bacteria clinical trial, the mean time for the T2Bacteria Panel to result was 6.46 hours, while the result for blood culture was substantially longer with a mean time to result of 123.8 ± 9 hrs. for a negative result and 51.0 ± 43.0 hrs. for a positive result, and the mean time to species identification was 83.7 ± 47.6 hours. A study published in the MicrobiologyOpen found that the T2Bacteria Panel decreased the time to species identification on average by 55 hours faster than blood culture. The rapid detection and identification of the pathogens by the T2Bacteria Panel in positive specimens also allowed for the early antimicrobial stewardship interventions with faster initiation of an effective targeted antibiotic therapy, in some of the patients which was captured in another study presented by Paggi R, et al. July 2021 with 29.2% of patients with T2Bacteria positive results switched to an appropriate therapy. Seitz T et al presented on the Evaluation of the clinical impact of the T2MR for the Diagnosis of Blood Stream Infections, where the data showed that the use of T2Bacteria led to a shorter length of stay for T2Bacteria of 10 days as compared with the 13 days for blood culture. The T2Bacteria Panel can ensure prompt diagnosis, assist clinicians in making clinical decisions about patient management such as the escalation or de-escalation of therapy faster, with improvement in patient care and outcomes, by potentially shortening the time of exposure to ineffective antibiotics, which may reduce the chances of developing anti-microbial resistance. Our sepsis panels are to be used in conjunction with whole blood cultures, and detecting the ESKAPE pathogens directly from whole blood in 3-5 hours, potentially enables therapy targeted to these organisms, which are often resistant to common empiric therapies. Detecting these commonly resistant organisms in 3-5 hours pre-culture is more critical than rapidly detecting those organisms which typically respond to common empiric therapies. In August 2019, CMS granted approval for a New Technology Add-on Payment, or NTAP, for the T2Bacteria Panel, effective October 1, 2019, which has been extended through the 2022 fiscal year. In its 2020 inpatient prospective payments system final rule, CMS explained: “the T2Bacteria Panel represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies because it reduces the proportion of patients on inappropriate therapy, thus reducing the rate of subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic intervention as well as length of stay and mortality rates caused by sepsis causing bacterial infections.” With this designation, U.S. hospitals are eligible for the NTAP payment for any in-patient T2Bacteria Panel testing performed on Medicare patients, to a maximum of $97.50 per test, in addition to the standard hospital payment under the appropriate sepsis MS-DRG codes. According to CMS there are more than 30 million Medicare patients in the United States enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service.

We believe T2Bacteria can enable clinicians to achieve targeted antimicrobial therapy, faster, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. We further believe that the adoption of the T2Dx Instrument and T2Bacteria can enable clinicians to make earlier and more informed decisions by providing positive test results to direct therapy and negative test results to reduce the use of antimicrobial drugs.
 T2Resistance
 Our T2Resistance Panel, which is CE marked in the EU, is a direct-from-blood test that simultaneously detects thirteen resistance genes from both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. T2Resistance is designed to identify the most clinically important carbapenem resistance genes KPC, OXA-48, NDM, VIM, and IMP. Carbapenem resistance has been listed on the CDC Urgent Threat list for antibiotic resistance. The T2Resistance Panel also detects a major source of extended spectrum beta lactamases, or ESBLs, CTXM-14 and CTXM-15; AmpC beta-lactamase genes (CMY, DHA); vanA vanB resistance genes, which are responsible for vancomycin resistant gram-positive enterococcus; and the detection of the methicillin resistance genes mecC and mecA, which cause methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Clinical performance data demonstrated that the T2Resistance Panel identified carbapenemase resistance genes with an average time of 5.3 hours. Antibiotic resistance is recognized by the WHO as “one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” 
 We believe the T2Resistance Panel can help to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms and improve patient outcomes by enabling rapid identification of the genes associated with antibiotic resistance – enabling correct targeted therapy and the reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use, which is a primary cause of antibiotic resistance. Most importantly, these tests have the potential to enable more patients to get on appropriate targeted therapy faster, and thereby reduce mortality and hospitalization costs. The T2Resistance Panel received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in February 2019 and CE marked in the EU in November 2019 and is available for purchase in the United States as a Research-Use-Only, or RUO product, meaning that it is in the laboratory research phase of development and is being shipped or delivered for an investigation that is not subject to FDA regulations governing investigational device studies. In December 2021 we initiated a U.S. clinical trial for the T2Resistance Panel. The clinical trial is expected to be completed in 2022, and we believe the data from this trial may enable filing a submission to the FDA in 2022.
 T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel
 Our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, which is commercially available in the United States under an EUA is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for COVID-19 infections, in certain patients. The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel provides sample-to-answer results in less than two hours, utilizing a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Clinical testing on known positive and negative patient samples showed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel runs on our T2Dx Instrument, and is capable of performing seven tests simultaneously. The Company has conducted a number of in silico analyses which have demonstrated that the T2SARS-CoV-2 was capable of detecting currently known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
 In March 2020, we announced that we had licensed certain technology for the development of a rapid test for COVID-19 from the Center for Discovery and Innovation, or CDI, at Hackensack Meridian Health. Under this license agreement, T2 Biosystems is authorized to use the CDI technology and adapt the CDI-developed COVID-19 test to the T2 Biosystems platform, and market and distribute the test in places of need amid the expanding pandemic. In August 2020, we received an EUA from the FDA to market the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel for the qualitative direct detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens (such as nasal, mid-turbinate, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swab specimens) and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. COVID-19 has since become a global pandemic infecting over 450 million individuals and causing over 6 million deaths as of March 10, 2022. 
 SARS-CoV-2 has a wide-ranging clinical manifestation that contributes to increased morbidity and mortality from mild symptoms to hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic disease, cytokine release syndrome, multiorgan failure, and in some, secondary infections. A study by David R. Little et al has shown that patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are more likely to develop sepsis and septic shock when compared to patients admitted with influenza during the 2016, 2017, or 2018 flu seasons. COVID-19 pneumonia typically presents with fever, cough and dyspnea and this has led to the use of empirical antibiotics in patients by the physicians while waiting for laboratory and radiological results further compounding the problem of rational antimicrobial agent usage.
 In a multicenter clinical study published in 2021 of hospitalized patients that were tested for COVID-19, the investigators found that SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were almost 2 times as likely to have a secondary pathogen detected during hospital onset period (42.4% vs 22.2%). There was also an increase in length of hospital stay for COVID-19 positive patients with a secondary positive pathogen detected vs patients with a negative pathogen specimen (13.7 vs 8.2 days). The data from the study additionally showed that 6 out of the top 10 pathogens detected by blood cultures of admitted patients are identified by the T2Bacteria and T2Candida panels. The existing reimbursement codes support our sepsis products and COVID-19 product and we anticipate the same for our product candidates in development.

Products - in Development 
 T2Biothreat
 Our T2Biothreat Panel is a direct-from-blood test panel that is designed to run on the T2Dx Instrument and to simultaneously detect six biothreat pathogens identified as threats by the U.S. Government, including Bacillus anthracis, Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Francisella tularensis, Richettsia prowazekii and Yersinia pestis. In December 2021, the Company initiated a U.S. clinical trial for the T2Biothreat Panel that includes positive samples being prepared and analyzed at a high-containment Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and negative samples being analyzed at a clinical site. The clinical trial is expected to be completed in 2022, and we believe the data from this trial may enable filing a submission to the FDA during 2022.
Comprehensive Sepsis Panel
 Our comprehensive sepsis panel is a direct-from-blood test panel that is designed to run on our next generation instrument. The new test panel is designed to detect greater than 95% of all bloodstream infections caused by bacterial and Candida species, and antibiotic resistant markers identified as threats by the CDC, in a single test and to provide a time to result of approximately 3 hours. We believe this test panel, if successfully developed and authorized by the FDA, could be positioned as the primary test for patients at risk of sepsis, and substantially change the blood culture based laboratory workflow.
Next Generation Instrument
 Our next-generation instrument, which is being developed in conjunction with our comprehensive sepsis panel, is designed to be fully automated, on-demand, and random access. This design is similar to our current T2Dx Instrument but incorporates faster turnaround times and is designed to detect an increased number of pathogens and resistance genes from a single, whole blood sample. 
 T2Cauris
 Our T2Cauris™ Panel is designed to provide direct detection of the emerging superbug Candida auris in patient skin, patient blood, and hospital environmental samples and is now available for RUO. The CDC evaluated the T2Cauris™ Panel swab test on patient skin samples and published their findings in Mycoses.
 Candida auris is a multi-drug resistant pathogen recognized by the CDC as a serious global health threat because it can be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs and is difficult to identify. The CDC has also reported that more than one-in-three patients with Candida auris infections have died. Unlike most other species of Candida, Candida auris can spread quickly in a hospital making rapid identification and hospital environment surveillance a critical component of containing these outbreaks. Existing laboratory methods that detect Candida auris, including blood culture, suffer from prolonged detection times and low accuracy, which exacerbates the challenge in the fight to contain the superbug. Recently, reported cases have surged internationally, and the CDC has reported a significant increase in infected patients in the United States. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, hospital outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom and Spain. Because Candida auris can be resistant to most treatment options and can spread so quickly, these hospital outbreaks have been difficult to contain by even the most enhanced control measures.
 The goals of the CDC collaboration were to use the T2Dx Instrument to (i) validate the detection of Candida auris from patient skin samples and hospital environmental samples, (ii) validate a process for surveillance of Candida auris in healthcare facilities from skin and environmental samples, and (iii) assist state and local public health labs in combating the outbreak. In a study presented at ASM Microbe 2018 regarding the detection of Candida auris, it was found that our technology provided accurate diagnostic results from patient skin samples. 
 T2Lyme
 Our T2Lyme Panel is a direct-from-blood test panel designed to run on the T2Dx Instrument to identify the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. We believe the T2Lyme Panel may benefit from similar advantages provided by our technology, including the potential for high sensitivity, high specificity, ease of use and rapid time to result. T2Lyme is designed to provide accurate and timely diagnosis of Lyme disease causing pathogens, with the goal of preventing the evolution of the disease to its later stages with associated neurological and musculoskeletal diseases. 
 According to the CDC, Lyme disease affects approximately 30,000 people in the U.S. each year, but the CDC also estimates that the actual number is closer to 360,000 due to under-reporting because of poor diagnostic methods. Approximately 3.4 million tests are run for Lyme disease each year, including serology testing, PCR techniques and blood culture, which has low sensitivity and takes approximately two to three weeks to provide results. Inadequate identification of Lyme disease may lead to antibiotic resistance, significant costs, and transmission of the disease through healthcare procedures such as blood transfusion. The misdiagnosis of Lyme disease has been reported to have an annual cost of more than $10,000 per patient in the United States, representing over $3 billion per year.
 We believe that our technology can address the significant unmet need associated with Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that can cause prolonged neurological disease and musculoskeletal disease. For patients with Lyme disease, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment 
 6


significantly reduces both the likelihood of developing neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as the significant costs associated with treating these complications. Multiple diagnostic methods are used to test for Lyme disease today, which are labor-intensive, can take weeks to process, and are subject to high false negative rates due to their inability to detect the disease, making each method unreliable in the diagnosis of the condition. Because of these limitations, patients are frequently misdiagnosed or are delayed in the diagnosis of this disease.
Based on feedback from the FDA and the dynamics of the Lyme disease testing market, we believe that the most expeditious path for commercializing the T2Lyme Panel may be by offering the test with a partner.
 Strategy
 Our objective is to establish our products as the standard of care for clinical diagnostics. To achieve this objective, our strategy is to focus on the following three corporate objectives:

• | Accelerating our Sales. Our sales strategy consists of two primary objectives: 1) significantly expanding our T2Dx Instrument installed base by selling or placing new instruments, and 2) growing our sepsis test panel revenue by driving broad utilization among new and existing customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2021, we entered into contracts for 32 T2Dx Instruments, including 17 instruments during the fourth quarter. Our installed base of T2Dx Instruments includes 89 in the U.S. and 55 internationally. We generated sepsis panel revenue of $5.1 million representing an increase of 46% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., we achieved annualized sepsis test utilization of $118,000 per legacy T2Dx Instrument, an increase of 37% compared to the prior year. We continue to believe that, over time, annualized sepsis test utilization will reach $200,000 per instrument in the U.S.
 To further penetrate the market we have materially expanded our commercial team. In the U.S., we have 20 sales territories providing geographic hospital coverage; increased from just 2 sales territories in 2020. We recently hired Brett Giffin as Chief Commercial Officer, and he leads our commercial growth initiatives and is directly responsible for global sales, marketing, service and customer support. 
 As recently announced, we continue to expand our international distribution network which allows our products to be marketed and sold in more countries. Hospitals around the world face similar challenges when caring for patients suspected of sepsis and we are leaning into this opportunity. In the second half of 2021, we initiated commercialization in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Mexico by entering into distributor agreements in each of these countries. Shipments to our distribution partners were initiated in the second half of 2021, with 2 T2Dx Instruments shipped to Singapore during the third quarter and 4 T2Dx Instruments shipped to South Korea during the fourth quarter. Early in 2022, we have continued to expand our distribution networks with agreements in Norway, Finland and Turkey and have hired an International Business Manager to focus on the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. 
 While sepsis remains the primary focus and the top commercial priority for T2 Biosystems, the introduction of our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel in 2020 has allowed us to significantly increase our installed base of T2Dx Instruments and gain access to U.S. hospitals that were previously unfamiliar with our products and services. The expanded installed base of 45 T2Dx instruments being used for COVID-19 testing will eventually play a meaningful role in increasing sepsis test panel sales because each of these customers has committed to evaluating our sepsis tests.
 Despite the broad use of at-home COVID-19 antigen tests, hospitals continue to rely on molecular or PCR tests, including the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, to identify acute COVID-19 infections. The early 2021 surge in COVID-19 infection rates has translated to strong demand for our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel from U.S. hospitals during the first quarter of 2021, and while we believe there will be continued demand for our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, we expect a decrease in sales of our COVID-19 test compared to 2021.
 Enhancing our Operations. To sustain growth and drive adoption and utilization of our products over the long-term we continue to implement changes to our operations that enable a more efficient business model. 
 We have focused on scaling our manufacturing capabilities and strengthening our supply chain. Over the past year, we have increased our manufacturing capabilities from being able to produce 2,000 tests per week to over 7,000 tests per day. To achieve this level of production, we reviewed and refined our business and manufacturing processes, as well as our business systems. We assessed multiple tools and determined that one of the best ways to improve our efficiency was by implementing a new Oracle ERP system, which we implemented during the third quarter of 2021. 
 In the third quarter of 2021, we signed a lease that will consolidate our existing operations into a single 70,000 square foot, state-of-the-art life sciences facility in Billerica, Massachusetts, to accommodate current and future growth. This new facility will serve as our corporate headquarters and main manufacturing hub. It will also house all of our R&D labs that will aid in the advancement of our future products. This move, which we expect will commence in the second half of 2022, will produce a significant reduction in rent expense, accommodate our manufacturing expansion, and reduce costs through efficiencies gained in working in and maintaining one facility.
 During 2022, we also plan to make strategic investments in tooling, automation, and efficiency projects to further scale our manufacturing capabilities and continue to improve cost of goods.

• | Advancing our Pipeline. We are continuing to prioritize the programs under our milestone-based product development contract awarded by BARDA, which is valued at up to $69 million. The four products that we are advancing under the BARDA contract are the T2Resistance Panel, the T2Biothreat Panel, the comprehensive sepsis panel, and the next-generation instrument.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our scientific team successfully completed the milestones described under Option 1 of the BARDA contract. BARDA subsequently chose to exercise Option 2A of the contract, which is planned for the period between October 2021 and March 2022 and is valued at $6.4 million. Upon the successful completion of Option 2A, we are optimistic that BARDA will choose to exercise Option 2B. 
 In December 2021, we initiated the U.S. clinical trials for the T2Resistance Panel and the T2Biothreat Panel, both ahead of our previously announced schedule. The clinical trials are designed to evaluate the performance of the T2Resistance and T2Biothreat panels and support submission of marketing applications to the FDA. 
 The T2Resistance Panel, which runs on our T2Dx Instrument, is a direct-from-blood test panel that simultaneously detects thirteen antibiotic resistance genes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, which are known to cause antibiotic-resistant infections that may lead to sepsis. It provides accurate results in 3-5 hours without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Resistance Panel, which is currently marketed and sold in the EU under a CE-mark, was granted Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA, which offers manufacturers an opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts through several different program options to efficiently address topics as they arise during the premarket review phase, and may help manufacturers receive feedback from the FDA in a timely way. All submissions for devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive priority review, meaning that the review of the submission is placed at the top of the appropriate review queue and receives additional review resources at FDA, as needed. The clinical trial for the T2Resistance Panel, which will include up to 1,500 patients across 10 U.S. hospitals, is estimated to cost T2 Biosystems $2.5 million and is expected to be completed in 2022, potentially enabling submission of a marketing application to the FDA during 2022. 
 The T2Biothreat Panel, which also runs on our T2Dx Instrument, is a direct-from-blood test panel that is designed to provide results in 3-5 hours, and to simultaneously detect six biothreat pathogens identified as threats by the CDC. The clinical trial, which includes positive samples being prepared and analyzed at a high-containment Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and negative samples being analyzed at a single site, is estimated to cost T2 Biosystems $450,000 and is expected to be completed in 2022, potentially enabling submission to the FDA during 2022.
 The comprehensive sepsis panel is a direct-from-blood test panel that is designed to run on our next generation instrument. This test panel is designed to detect greater than 95% of all bloodstream infections caused by bacterial and Candida species, and antibiotic resistant markers identified as threats by the CDC, in a single test and to provide a time to result of approximately 3 hours. We believe this test panel, if successfully developed and authorized by the FDA, could be positioned as the primary test for patients at risk of sepsis, and substantially change the blood culture based laboratory workflow.
 The next-generation instrument, which is being developed in conjunction with our comprehensive sepsis panel, is designed to be fully-automated, on-demand, and random access. This design is similar to our current T2Dx Instrument but incorporates faster turnaround times and is designed to detect an increased number of pathogens and resistance genes from a single, whole blood sample. The design is approaching completion, and based on the currently outlined schedule, we expect to have a fully functioning Beta unit in the first half of 2022. Once the build-out is complete, we will merge prototypes with the assay and begin full scale system wet testing.
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We are working to drive awareness and adoption of our products with a direct sales force that targets hospitals that treat critical care patients. At the end of 2021, our commercial organization consisted of 31 people, including 22 people in sales and marketing. 
 Our sales team employs a strategic approach focusing on clinical value of our products highlighting clinical data, clinical performance of our products, improved patient outcomes and the economic value for hospitals, including providing these hospitals with a customized budget-impact analysis. They also demonstrate the ease-of-use of our products and highlight the advantages of our products over existing diagnostics and empiric therapy practices.
 Today, our team markets and sells the T2Dx Instrument, T2Bacteria, T2Candida and T2SARS-CoV-2 products directly to hospitals in the United States. If these institutions optimize the full extent of our technology, we expect a positive network effect in the hospital community, accelerating adoption of T2Bacteria and T2Candida. We believe key aspects of healthcare reform, including a sensitivity to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, the focus on cost containment, risk-sharing, and outcomes-based treatment and reimbursement, are aligned with the value proposition of our sepsis products, contributing positively to their adoption. 
 Outside of the United States, we have received marketing authorizations or certifications in the EU, Australia, and certain countries in the Middle East and Africa, and expect to seek regulatory authorizations or certifications in additional international markets. We market our products primarily through distribution partners who utilize a similar model as our sales approach in the United States. We have obtained CE mark for our products as follows: T2Candida and T2Dx Instrument in July 2014, T2Bacteria in September 2017, and T2Resistance in November 2019. As of the end of 2021, we had distributors throughout the EU, and in a growing number of countries in Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. These distributors typically have strong, existing relationships with key opinion leaders, have relationships with important hospitals in their 
 8


respective countries, and have experience in infectious diseases and/or microbiology. We continue to develop partner relationships in other key international markets and plan to further expand our distribution channels in other key markets around the world. We have employed a small regionally-focused commercial team of business managers and field service personnel primarily to support the efforts of our distributors. 
 Medical and Clinical Affairs
 We continue to educate physicians, key decision makers and thought leaders through publishing scientific data in peer-reviewed journals, presenting at major industry conferences and conducting and supporting clinical studies. At the beginning of 2021, we hired Aparna Ahuja, MD as Chief Medical Officer. She has led a total rebuild of our medical, clinical, and regulatory teams. In the past, our medical affairs team was limited to Pharm Ds, and today we have a highly diverse and experienced medical and clinical affairs team of 15 people, which is comprised of infectious disease MDs, laboratory professionals, and Pharm Ds. Our clinical and medical affairs teams are raising awareness by amplifying clinical value messaging for our products. The team is actively engaged with Key Opinion Leaders to generate and share real world data via scientific journal publications, at medical conferences, and at industry trade shows. During 2021, our products were mentioned in over 50 publications, posters, and presentations.
 We believe the key decision-makers at hospitals are infectious disease and critical care physicians, laboratory directors, hospital pharmacy, Chief Medical Officers, and hospital administrators. In response to the severity and complexity of managing bloodstream infections, a growing number of hospitals have instituted sepsis committees or antimicrobial stewardship committees to control hospital practices related to infections, including the use of antibiotic and antifungal therapy. These committees typically include key decision-makers, and we believe they can provide a central forum to present the benefits of our products. In addition, we plan to continue to publish scientific data in peer-reviewed journals, present at major medical and scientific conferences and conduct and support clinical trials to provide additional data relative to the performance of T2Candida and T2Bacteria to these decision-makers.
 Manufacturing
 We manufacture our proprietary T2Dx Instrument and our sepsis test panels at our manufacturing facilities in Lexington, MA and Wilmington, MA. We perform all instrument and tray manufacturing and packaging of final components in accordance with applicable guidelines for medical device manufacturing. We outsource manufacturing of T2SARS-CoV-2 consumable cartridges to a contract manufacturer. Our particles are supplied by a sole source supplier, GE Healthcare. We believe we can secure arrangements with other suppliers on commercially reasonable terms for the products and parts we outsource.
 We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards governing medical device products. These regulations govern the design, manufacture, testing, release and service of diagnostic products as well as raw material receipt and control. We have received ISO 13485:2016 registration from the National Standards Authority of Ireland. Our key outsourcing partners are also ISO-certified.
 We plan to continue to manufacture components that we determine are proprietary or require special processes to produce, while outsourcing the supply of more commodity-like components. We expect to establish additional outsourcing partnerships as we manufacture more products. We believe our facilities in Lexington and Wilmington, Massachusetts are adequate to meet our current manufacturing needs and that additional manufacturing space is readily available for future expansion.
 In November 2021, we entered into a lease for 70,125 square feet of office, research, laboratory and manufacturing space in Billerica, Massachusetts. We plan to consolidate all manufacturing facilities into this facility by 2023.
 Raw Materials
 We purchase many different types of raw materials, including plastics, magnets, metals, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological and chemical products. We seek to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing and also review relevant sources for compliance with conflict minerals requirements. Some of our components are custom-made by only a handful of external suppliers. In certain instances, we have a sole source supply for key product components of the T2Dx Instruments and certain components for our test kits. We have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. We have reviewed our suppliers and quantities of key materials and believe we have sufficient stocks and alternate sources of critical materials should our supply chains become disrupted, although raw materials and plastics for the manufacturing of reagents and consumables are in high demand, and interruptions in supply are difficult to predict. We are also experiencing unprecedented cost increases from many of our suppliers, primarily as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, labor and supply disruptions and increased inflation. The areas of cost increases include raw materials, components, and value-add supplier labor. We believe that we can continue to take actions to limit the impact of cost increases on such devices, including bulk purchases and entering into long term supply agreements. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Strategies - We utilize third-party, single-source suppliers for some components and materials used in our products and product candidates, and the loss of any of these suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business.” for additional information.

Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our product and product candidates, including their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We own or exclusively license over 35 issued U.S. patents and over 15 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also own or license over 50 pending or granted counterpart applications worldwide. We possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business and products. The patent families comprising our patent portfolio are primarily focused on protection of a range of general and specific attributes of our proprietary assay architecture and assay instrumentation for our T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, T2Cauris products, and our T2Lyme product candidates, as well as protection of certain aspects of the conduct of the assays and detection of analytes. The issued patents in our patent families that cover T2Candida and T2Bacteria are expected to expire between 2023 and 2034, while additional pending applications covering T2Candida and T2Bacteria would be expected, if issued, to expire as late as 2037. The issued patents in our patent families that cover T2Lyme are expected to expire between 2023 and 2034, while additional pending applications covering T2Lyme would be expected, if issued, to expire as late as 2037. In all cases, the expiration dates are subject to any extension that may be available under applicable law.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important proprietary technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, including our methods, processes and product candidate designs, and our ability to defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our products and product candidates. Protecting these rights is a primary focus in our relationships with other parties, and we seek to protect such rights, in part, by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with such third parties and including protections for such proprietary information and intellectual property rights in our other contracts with such third parties, including material transfer agreements, licenses and research agreements.
 Proprietary Rights and Processes
 We rely, in some circumstances, on proprietary technology and processes (including trade secrets) to protect our technology. However, these can be difficult to protect. We require all full-time and temporary employees, scientific advisors, contractors and consultants working for us who have access to our confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements in order to safeguard our proprietary technologies, methods, processes, know-how, and trade secrets. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. All of our full-time and temporary employees and independent contractors and consultants are also bound by invention assignment obligations, pursuant to which rights to all inventions and other types of intellectual property conceived by them during the course of their employment are assigned to us.
 While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Further, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Trademarks
 We have trademarks and intend to continue to seek trademark protection.
 License Agreements
 In 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, pursuant to which MGH granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights to make, use, import and commercialize products and processes for diagnostic, industrial and research and development purposes. In 2008 and 2011, we amended our agreement with MGH to add patent rights and to modify, among other things, our diligence and payment obligations.
 We are required to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and make available to the public products and processes covered by the agreement, and to achieve specified organizational, development and commercialization milestones by specified dates. To date, we have met all of our diligence obligations pursuant to this agreement.
 We paid MGH an upfront fee and issued to MGH shares of our common stock equal to a low single-digit percentage of our then-outstanding common stock, subject to limited adjustments to prevent dilution in certain circumstances. In addition, we are responsible for reimbursing MGH’s costs associated with prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. We will also be required to make payments for achievement of specified regulatory milestones with respect to products and processes covered by the agreement. In addition, we 
 10


are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee, which is creditable against any royalty payments we are obligated to make to MGH under the agreement.
 We are required to pay royalties to MGH on net sales of products and processes that are covered by patent rights licensed to us under the agreement at percentages in the low single digits, subject to reductions and offsets in specified circumstances. The products and processes covered by the agreement include T2Bacteria, T2Candida and other particle-based test panels that we may develop in the future. Our royalty obligations, if any, and their duration, will depend on the specific patent rights covering the product or process being sold, and the particular category of product or process, as noted above. With respect to T2Bacteria, T2Candida and other potential particle-based test panels we may develop in the future, our obligation to pay royalties to MGH will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the first product or process in the particular category and the expiration of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. We will also be required to pay to MGH a low double-digit percentage of specified gross revenue that we receive from our sublicensees. In addition, we will be required to pay royalties to MGH of less than one percent on net sales of specified products and processes that are not covered by the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. Our obligation to pay royalties to MGH with respect to such products and processes will expire upon the earlier of 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first such product or process and the termination by MGH of all of the licenses granted to us under the agreement.
 We have the right to terminate our agreement with MGH for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to MGH. MGH may terminate our agreement in its entirety if we fail to make a payment required under the agreement and do not cure such failure within a specified time period, if we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage or if we become insolvent. MGH may also terminate our agreement, with respect to a given category of products or processes, on 60 days’ notice for our uncured breach with respect to such category of products or processes. Absent earlier termination, our agreement with MGH will remain in force until the later of the expiration or abandonment of the licensed patents and patent applications, and the expiration of our obligations under the agreement.
 Supply Agreement with SMC Ltd.
 We are currently party to a supply agreement with SMC Ltd. for the supply and manufacture of plastic injection molded products are used across all T2 product lines. The agreement contains other terms and conditions generally consistent with an agreement for the manufacture and supply of materials or products for use in the development and commercialization of biotechnology products such as our products and product candidates, including with respect to ordering, supply of such product in accordance with specifications, and quality assurance and quality control activities.
 The supply agreement may be terminated prior to the end of its term upon the occurrence of certain specified events and further provides that upon termination, including upon the expiration of the term, SMC shall continue to manufacture and ship products subject to outstanding purchase orders and we shall be responsible for purchasing finished products, inventory, raw materials and work-in-progress held by SMC to the extent SMC, after the use of commercially reasonable efforts to use such inventory, cannot use such inventory in a financially viable way.
 BARDA Contract
 In September 2019, BARDA awarded the Company a milestone-based contract, with an initial value of $6.0 million, and a potential value of up to $69.0 million, if BARDA awards all contract options. BARDA operates within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR, at HHS. If BARDA awards and the Company completes all options, the Company’s management believes it will enable a significant expansion of the Company’s current portfolio of diagnostics for sepsis-causing pathogen and antibiotic resistance genes. In September 2020, the Company completed the initial award and BARDA exercised the first contract option valued at $10.5 million. In September 2021, BARDA exercised Option 2A valued at approximately $6.4 million. In April 2021, BARDA agreed to accelerate product development by modifying the contract to advance future deliverables into the currently funded Option 1 of the BARDA contract for the next generation instrument, T2Biothreat, T2Resistance and comprehensive sepsis panel. Should BARDA reduce, cancel or not grant additional milestone projects, our ability to continue our future product development may be impacted.
 Competition
 While we believe that we are currently the only diagnostic company with FDA-cleared or CE marked commercial products capable of detecting sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes directly from whole blood, at limits of detection as low as 1 CFU/mL, without the need of culturing colony growth, we compete with commercial diagnostics companies for the limited resources of our customers. Our principal competition is from a number of companies that offer platforms and applications in our target sepsis markets, most of which are more established commercial organizations with considerable name recognition and significant financial resources.
 Companies that currently provide traditional blood culture-based diagnostics include Becton Dickinson & Co. and bioMerieux, Inc. In addition, companies offering post-culture species identification using both molecular and non-molecular methods include bioMerieux, Inc. (and its affiliate, BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.), Bruker Corporation, Accelerate Diagnostics, Luminex, Roche, Cepheid and Beckman Coulter, a Danaher company. These post-culture competitors rely on a positive result from blood culture in order to perform their tests, significantly prolonging their results when compared to our technology. Some of the products offered by our competitors require hours of extensive hands-on labor by an operator, while some rely on high concentrations of pathogens present in a positive blood culture, which can require a final concentration of at least 1,000,000 CFU/mL. In addition, there may be a number of new market entrants in the process of developing other post-blood culture 
 11


diagnostic technologies that may be perceived as competitive with our technology. Karius, Inc. offers a lab developed culture independent diagnostic test for the identification of pathogens that has not been cleared by the FDA but may be perceived as competitive with our technology.
 We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages, including:
  
• | our products’ ability to detect targets directly in complex and high volume samples, including whole blood, eliminating the need for sample extraction and purification;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our products’ ability to detect a broad range of targets, providing a wide variety of potential applications both within and outside of the in vitro diagnostics market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our products’ ability to provide rapid and highly-sensitive diagnostic results, which can provide timely information to assist physicians and hospitals to make therapeutic decisions that can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to develop easily operable products for end users;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | our applications in the field of sepsis that we believe will not require separate reimbursement codes due to the established payment and reimbursement structure in place; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our applications may provide substantial economic benefits to hospitals that can accrue the savings related to the rapid treatment of sepsis patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to identifying sepsis-causing pathogens, we can also identify the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Competition for molecular testing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the same large commercial organizations named above, and extends to other large companies like Abbott, Roche, Bio-Rad, PerkinElmer, Hologic, Thermo Fisher and others. In 2020 and 2021, many of these companies experienced supply shortages for the tests due to high demand. We believe one competitive advantage in this space is the availability of tests due to our ability to produce more tests than our installed base of customers can consume.
 Government Regulation
 Our products and our operations are subject to significant government regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, as well as comparable authorities in other jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. 
 The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:
  
• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical studies;
--+------------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | pre-market clearance and approval;
--+-----------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


• | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

FDA Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or pre-market approval, or PMA, from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the FDA. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of 
 12


adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device are categorized as Class III. These devices require submission and approval of a PMA application.
 510(k) Clearance Process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and accepted by the FDA, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require pre-market approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance, issuance of a de novo classification or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. Our T2Bacteria Panel received 510(k) clearance from the FDA on May 24, 2018.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended testing methods, where feasible.
 Pre-market Approval Process
 Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and filed by the FDA, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. 
 13


The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. 
 Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
 De novo Classification Process
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low-to-moderate-risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and/or that special controls cannot be developed. On September 22, 2014, the FDA granted de novo classification to the T2Dx and T2Candida, and classified these products as Class II medical devices. 
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application or de novo request, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) pre-market notification. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. 
 Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational 
 14


plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 Following passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA implemented the Breakthrough Devices Program, which is a voluntary program offered to manufacturers of certain medical devices and device-led combination products that may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. The goal of the program is to provide patients and health care providers with more timely access to qualifying devices by expediting their development, assessment and review, while preserving the statutory standards for PMA approval, 510(k) clearance and de novo classification. The program is available to medical devices that meet certain eligibility criteria, including that the device provides more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, and that the device meets one of the following criteria: (i) the device represents a breakthrough technology, (ii) no approved or cleared alternatives exist, (iii) the device offers significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, or (iv) the availability of the device is in the best interest of patients. Breakthrough Device designation provides certain benefits to device developers, including more interactive and timely communications with FDA staff, use of post-market data collection, when scientifically appropriate, to facilitate expedited and efficient development and review of the device, opportunities for efficient and flexible clinical study design, and prioritized review of premarket submissions. 
Emergency Use Authorization
 The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of HHS may, under certain circumstances in connection with a declared public health emergency, allow for the marketing of a product that does not otherwise comply with FDA regulations by issuing an EUA for such product. Before an EUA may be issued by HHS, the Secretary must declare an emergency based a determination that public health emergency exists that effects or has the significant potential to affect, national security, and that involves a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, or CBRN, or a specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such CBRN. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is such a public health emergency that involves the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection. Once the determination of the threat or emergency has been made, the Secretary of HHS must then declare that an emergency exists justifying the issuance of EUAs for certain types of products (referred to as EUA declarations). On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared – on the basis of his determination of a public health emergency that has the potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad that involves SARS-CoV-2 – that circumstances exist justifying authorization of in vitro diagnostic devices during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any EUA that is issued. 
 Once an EUA declaration has been issued, the FDA can issue EUAs for products that fall within the scope of that declaration. To issue an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that (1) the CBRN that is referred to in the EUA declaration can cause serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions; (2) based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition attributable to the CBRN and that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks; and (3) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product. Products subject to an EUA must still comply with the conditions of the EUA, including labeling and marketing requirements. Moreover, the authorization to market products under an EUA is limited to the period of time the EUA declaration is in effect, and the FDA can revoke an EUA in certain circumstances.
 At certain points during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has issued policies indicating that it would not object to test developers distributing or offering their validated tests prior to receipt of an EUA, provided the test developers met certain criteria set forth in published enforcement policies. In June 2020, we launched the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, our COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test, after validation of the test pursuant to the FDA’s policy permitting COVID-19 tests to be marketed prior to receipt of an EUA, subject to certain prerequisites. In August 2020, the FDA granted an EUA to the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel for the qualitative direct detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory specimens (such as nasal, mid-turbinate, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swab specimens) and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider.
 Research-use-only devices
 Some of our products, including our T2Resistance Panel and T2Cauris Panel are currently available RUO. An RUO device is an in vitro diagnostic device, or IVD, that is in the laboratory research phase of development. IVDs that are marketed for RUO are not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices more generally, including the requirements for clearance or approval and compliance with the FDA’s QSR. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use.

Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
  
• | including Medical Device Reporting, which requires manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to cleared devices or devices authorized through the de novo classification process that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in intended use of such devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of investigational products or promotion of “off-label” uses for cleared or approved products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with marketed medical devices, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:
  
• | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


• | mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | administrative detention or banning of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new product versions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution and penalties.
--+------------------------------------

International Regulation
 Sales of medical devices (including in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or IVD MDs) outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.

Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
 The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigations, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices (including IVD MDs).
 In the EU, there is currently no premarket government review of medical devices (including IVD MDs). However, the EU requires that all IVD MDs placed on the market in the EU must meet the essential requirements of the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (Directive 98/79/EC), or IVDD, including the requirement that an IVD MD must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
 Compliance with the essential requirements of the IVDD is a prerequisite for European conformity marking, or CE mark, without which IVD MDs cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the IVDD, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of IVD MDs and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for (general) IVD MDs (i.e., all IVD MDs other than those covered by Annex II to the IVDD and IVD MDs for self-testing), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. We conducted a conformity assessment of the T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida with the IVDD in late 2014, based upon an EC declaration of conformity dated July 7, 2014 and updated on September 9, 2015 and May 26, 2016, allowing us to affix the CE mark to these products. For T2Bacteria and T2Resistance we respectively obtained a declaration of conformity on June 30, 2017 and on November 14, 2019, allowing us to affix the CE mark to these products.
 Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
 All manufacturers placing IVD MDs on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of an in vitro diagnostic medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through field safety notices.
 The advertising and promotion of in vitro diagnostic medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth by EU directives. According to the IVDD, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at national level. EU member states laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices (including in vitro diagnostic medical devices), which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
 Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices (including IVD MDs), in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
 17


In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The EU regulatory landscape concerning medical devices is evolving. On April 5, 2017, Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU, or IVDR, was adopted to establish a modernized and more robust EU legislative framework, with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. Unlike the IVDD, the IVDR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at reducing the risk of discrepancies in interpretation across the different European markets. On October 14, 2021, the European Commission proposed a “progressive” roll-out of the EU IVDR to prevent disruption in the supply of IVDs. The European Parliament and Council voted to adopt the proposed regulation on December 15, 2021, and the regulation entered into force on January 2022. The EU IVDR will fully apply on May 26, 2022 but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation.
 The IVDR will become applicable five years after publication on May 26, 2022. Once applicable, the IVDR will among other things:
  
• | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impose an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | set up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices that may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Brexit
 Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and IVD MDs whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their United Kingdom, or UK, Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the UK. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. By July 1, 2023, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UKCA, or UK Conformity Assessed, mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
 An MHRA public consultation was opened until end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC and the IVDD), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform IVD MDs regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime.
 In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related 
 18


activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Our current and future business activities are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations regarding payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of life sciences companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Also, as stated above, many states have similar fraud and abuse laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor.
 Moreover, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain device manufacturers, among others, to report certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives) and teaching hospitals, and to report ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. The statute includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value including, but not limited to, consulting fees, speaker honoraria, charitable contributions, research payments and grants. Failure to report could subject companies to significant financial penalties. Tracking and reporting the required payments and transfers of value may result in considerable expense and additional resources. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics 
 19


codes, implementation of gift bans and spending limits, and/or reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals.
 We also may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information for or on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. In addition to HIPAA criminal penalties, HITECH created four new tiers of civil and monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our future operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Climate Change and Environmental Laws
 The medical device industry is increasingly becoming subject of scrutiny, stringent regulation and the demand for green, sustainable products. We are focused on monitoring these increasing requirements for efficient and accurate processes for hazardous substance handling, supplier disclosures, and regulatory reporting in order to comply with numerous global health and environmental regulatory requirements and restrictions.
 We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing facilities. The cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Maintaining and growing sales of our diagnostic tests depend in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services, including clinical laboratory tests. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors may deny coverage if they determine that our products are not cost-effective as determined by the payor, or are deemed by the third-party payor to be experimental or medically unnecessary. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products, product candidates, or services in which our products are used, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our tests, product candidates, or services in which our products are used could reduce physician utilization of our tests, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 Hospitals, clinical laboratories and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our products and/or product candidates generally bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products and/or product candidates. The majority of our diagnostic tests are performed in a hospital inpatient setting, where governmental payors, such as Medicare, generally reimburse hospitals with a single bundled payment that is based on the patients’ diagnosis under a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups, or MS-DRGs, classification for all items and services provided to the patient during a single hospitalization, regardless of whether our diagnostic tests are performed during such hospitalization. In addition, new products may be eligible for an add-on payment for a time period up to three years if they meet certain criteria, including, among other things, demonstrating a substantial clinical improvement relative to services or technologies previously available. Effective October 1, 2019, hospitals paid under the Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System are eligible to receive a new technology add-on payment, or NTAP for T2Bacteria, which is incremental to the MS-DRG reimbursement for qualifying Medicare inpatient cases based on the cost of the case. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has subsequently extended the NTAP for T2Bacteria for fiscal years 2021 and 2022. To the extent that our diagnostic tests are performed in an outpatient setting, certain of our tests, including our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel may be eligible for separate payment using existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures.  EU member states and the UK impose controls on whether products are reimbursable 
 20


by national or regional health service providers and on the prices at which devices are reimbursed under state-run healthcare schemes. More and more, local, product specific reimbursement law is applied as an overlay to medical device regulation, which has provided an additional layer of clearance requirement.
 We are unable to predict at this time whether our products and/or product candidates, if approved, will be covered by third-party payors. Nor can we predict at this time the adequacy of payments, whether made separately in an outpatient setting or with a bundled payment amount in an inpatient setting. Our customers’ access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and/or product candidates by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, absent additional congressional action. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, enacted on April 16, 2015, repealed the formula by which Medicare made annual payment adjustments to physicians and replaced the former formula with fixed annual updates and a new system of incentive payments that are based on various performance measures and physicians’ participation in alternative payment models such as accountable care organizations. It is unclear what effect new quality and payment programs, such as MACRA, may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 On January 1, 2018, CMS implemented certain provisions of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which made substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostics laboratory tests”), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. CMS uses the data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish a revised Medicare reimbursement rate. Under PAMA, the revised Medicare reimbursement rates were scheduled to apply to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018. The revised reimbursement methodology is expected to generally result in relatively lower reimbursement under Medicare for clinical diagnostic lab tests that has been historically available. Any reduction to payment rates resulting from the new methodology is limited to 10% per test per year in 2018 through 2020, and to 15% per test per year in 2021 through 2023. The CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, amended the timeline for reporting private payer payment rates and delayed by one year the payment reductions scheduled for 2021. On December 10, 2021, Congress passed the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, or PMAFSA, which delayed the next data reporting period by an additional year and prevented any reduction in payment amounts from commercial payer rate implementation in 2022.
 We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. 
 For instance, in December 2021, the EU Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. This regulation which entered into force in January 2022 intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including some medical devices and IVD MDs, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the 
 21


innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
 Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. We are currently focused on several product candidates and enhancements utilizing our proprietary technology. Major components of the research and development expenses were salaries and benefits, research-related facility and overhead costs, laboratory supplies, equipment and contract services. Research and development expenses can be impacted by services performed and expenses incurred under collaboration agreements and other research and development contracts.
 We continuously seek to improve our proprietary technology. As we make improvements, we anticipate we will make available new and improved generations of our diagnostic instruments and panels. Our technology developmental efforts are focused on applying our proprietary technology to additional potential applications in the in vitro diagnostics area. We believe that technical advantage is important to sustain a competitive advantage, and therefore our research and development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement of our proprietary technology. We are dedicated to ongoing innovation to our technology and expanding our pipeline of product candidates. Our goal is for our technology to become a standard of care by offering a rapid, sensitive and simple diagnostic alternative to existing methodologies for identifying sepsis, with a long-term objective of targeting the broader in vitro diagnostics market.
  In September 2019, BARDA awarded the Company a milestone-based contract, with an initial value of $6.0 million, and a potential value of up to $69.0 million, if BARDA awards all contract options (the “U.S. Government Contract”). BARDA operates within the Office of the ASPR at HHS. If BARDA awards and the Company completes all options, the Company’s management believes it will enable a significant expansion of the Company’s current portfolio of diagnostics for sepsis-causing pathogen and antibiotic resistance genes. In September 2020, BARDA exercised the first contract option valued at $10.5 million. In September 2021, BARDA exercised Option 2A valued at approximately $6.4 million. 
 In April 2021, BARDA agreed to accelerate product development by modifying the contract to advance future deliverables into the currently funded Option 1 of the BARDA contract for T2Biothreat, T2Resistance and our next generation instrument and comprehensive sepsis panel. The modification does not change the overall total potential value of the BARDA contract. 
 The Company recorded contribution revenue of $11.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, under the BARDA contract.
