ITEM 1.                                     BUSINESS
Overview
Barnwell was incorporated in Delaware in 1956 and fiscal 2018 represented Barnwell’s 62nd year of operations. Barnwell operates in the following three principal business segments:


• | Oil and Natural Gas Segment - Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada. 


• | Land Investment Segment - Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii. 


• | Contract Drilling Segment - Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii. 

Oil and Natural Gas Segment
Overview
Barnwell acquires and develops crude oil and natural gas assets in the province of Alberta, Canada via two corporate entities, Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil. Barnwell of Canada is a U.S. incorporated company that has been active in Canada for over 50 years, primarily as a non-operator participating in exploration projects operated by others. Octavian Oil is a Canadian company, set up in 2016, to achieve long term growth through the acquisition of crude oil reserves and development of these reserves through horizontal well drilling and completion techniques.
Strategy
Since 2013, Barnwell has transformed its Canadian oil and natural gas segment operation from a 90% non-operated production base, most of which was from its 40-year-old Dunvegan gas field, to a more operated production base. In 2013, only about 20% of Barnwell’s production was conventional oil, and capital investments were being directed towards heavy oil drilling projects in the province of Saskatchewan. In 2014 Barnwell sold all of its heavy oil properties, and in 2015 Barnwell sold its Dunvegan gas property. These sales allowed Barnwell to minimize the effects of the subsequent commodity price collapse in 2015 and downstream transportation issues. Barnwell of Canada retained its core conventional oil assets and, since 2015, has acquired various conventional oil interests in Alberta from other companies to consolidate interests in these core properties. In February 2018, Barnwell sold its interest in its oil and natural gas property Red Earth. In August 2018, Barnwell closed a significant acquisition of conventional oil assets and infrastructure in the Twining area of Alberta. At September 30, 2018, Barnwell’s reserves were approximately 80% operated and 65% conventional oil and natural gas liquids, as compared to 55% operated and 44% conventional oil and natural gas liquids at September 30, 2017.
Operations
All acquisition and developmental activities, as well as all field operations and regulatory compliance, are the direct responsibility of Barnwell of Canada’s President and Chief Operating Officer and Octavian Oil's President. Strategic direction and approvals for major expenditures are secured from Barnwell’s senior executive management.

Our oil and natural gas segment revenues, profitability, and future rate of growth are dependent on oil and natural gas prices and obtaining external financing or sufficient land investment cash flows to fund the development of our proved undeveloped reserves. The industry has experienced a prolonged period of low oil and natural gas prices that has negatively impacted our operating results, cash flows and liquidity. Credit and capital markets for oil and natural gas companies have been negatively affected as well, resulting in a decline in sources of financing as compared to previous years. By divesting significant oil and natural gas assets prior to the 2015 decline in commodity prices, Barnwell was able to repay all of its debt, use funds for general corporate purposes, and fund its acquisition investments.
Natural gas prices are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to increased heating demand. Oil prices are also subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Oil and natural gas unit sales are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the properties’ operator. Prices received in Canada, especially natural gas and heavy oil have also been negatively impacted by the lack of export pipeline capacity. 

On August 28, 2018, Barnwell completed the acquisition of interests in oil and natural gas properties located in the Twining area of Alberta, Canada, from an independent third party. The purchase price per the agreement was $10,362,000, which took into account customary purchase price adjustments to reflect the economic activity from the effective date of July 1, 2018 to the closing date. The final determination of the customary adjustments to the purchase price has not yet been made, however it is not expected to result in a material adjustment. Barnwell also assumed $3,076,000 in asset retirement obligations associated with the Twining acquisition. This acquisition represents a significant step in Barnwell’s long-term strategy to transform its Canadian operations to having almost exclusively conventional light and medium oil assets. This was a strategic purchase by the Company of what is now its largest oil property. The Twining assets, which Barnwell operates, are expected to provide Barnwell with relatively low decline oil production, significant upside from a large volume of oil-in-place, operated infrastructure, and an advantageous geographic location in Central Alberta. Since closing, Barnwell’s net production from Twining for the two months of September and October 2018 has remained steady at an average of approximately 450 Boe per day.
Our proved undeveloped reserves, which are primarily attributable to Twining, are estimated to be converted to proved developed reserves through future capital expenditures by Barnwell of approximately $14,000,000 for the development of 12 gross (8.75 net) wells over the next five years.
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
Barnwell’s reserves are estimated by our independent petroleum reserve engineers, InSite, in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques and rules and regulations of the SEC. All information with respect to the Company’s reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of InSite. A copy of the report issued by InSite is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1. 

The preparation of data used by the independent petroleum reserve engineers to compile our oil and natural gas reserve estimates is completed in accordance with various internal control procedures which include verification of data input into reserves evaluation software, reconciliations and reviews of data provided to the independent petroleum reserve engineers to ensure completeness, and management review controls, including an independent internal review of the final reserve report for completeness and accuracy.

Barnwell has a Reserves Committee consisting of four independent directors, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and President, and the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Reserves Committee was established to ensure the independence of the Company’s petroleum reserve engineers. The Reserves Committee is responsible for reviewing the annual reserve evaluation report prepared by the independent petroleum reserve engineering firm and ensuring that the reserves are reported fairly in a manner consistent with applicable standards. The Reserves Committee meets annually to discuss reserve issues and policies and to meet with Company personnel and the independent petroleum reserve engineers.

Barnwell of Canada’s President and Chief Operating Officer has primary responsibility for overseeing the preparation of the Company’s reserve estimates by our independent petroleum reserve engineers. He is a professional engineer with over 35 years of relevant experience in all facets of the oil and natural gas industry in Canada and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta.
Reserves
The amounts set forth in the following table, based on InSite’s evaluation of our reserves, summarize our estimated proved reserves of oil (including natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2018 on all properties in which Barnwell has an interest. All of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in Canada and are based on constant dollars. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) existing at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with, or included in reports to, any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since October 1, 2017.

 | As of September 30, 2018 
 | Estimated Proved Developed Reserves | Estimated Proved Undeveloped Reserves | | Estimated Proved Reserves
Oil, including natural gas liquids (Bbls) | 693,000 | | 897,000 | | 1,590,000
Natural gas (Mcf) | 2,399,000 | | 2,656,000 | | 5,055,000
Total (Boe) | 1,107,000 | | 1,355,000 | | 2,462,000

During fiscal 2018, Barnwell’s total net proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas liquids increased by 280,000 Bbls (68%) and total net proved developed reserves of natural gas decreased by 606,000 Mcf (20%), for a combined increase of 176,000 Boe (19%). The increase in oil and natural gas liquids reserves was primarily the result of the Twining asset acquisition. The decrease in gas reserves was due to lower rolling average historical first-day-of-the-month natural gas prices used in the determination of reserve volumes at September 30, 2018, partially offset by the Twining asset acquisition. 
Proved undeveloped reserves, which primarily relate to our acquisition of Twining in August 2018, totaled 897,000 Bbls of oil and natural gas liquids and 2,656,000 Mcf of gas as of September 30, 2018. Our 
7

proved undeveloped reserves are planned for development within five years and are based on approximately $14,000,000 of future estimated capital expenditures to develop 12 gross (8.75 net) wells. The ability of Barnwell to convert the undeveloped reserves to developed reserves will be heavily influenced by the cash flows generated by the oil and natural gas segment, the results of such drilling, and the ability of the Company to raise sufficient funds that may be needed for any potential future capital financing. There were no proved undeveloped reserves at September 30, 2017. 
The following table sets forth Barnwell’s oil and natural gas net reserves at September 30, 2018, by property name, based on information prepared by InSite, as well as net production and net revenues by property name for the year ended September 30, 2018. The reserve data in this table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at September 30, 2018, the date of the projection.

 | As of September 30, 2018 | For the year ended September 30, 2018
 | Net Proved Producing Reserves | Total Net Proved Reserves | | Net Production | Net Revenues
Property Name | Oil & NGL (MBbls) | Gas (MMcf) | | Oil & NGL (MBbls) | Gas (MMcf) | Oil & NGL (Bbls) | | Gas (Mcf) | Oil & NGL | Gas

Proved reserves that are attributable to existing producing wells are primarily determined using decline curve analysis and rate transient analysis, which incorporates the principles of hydrocarbon flow. Proved reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. Technologies relied on to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility include electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available production data, seismic data and well test data.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The following table sets forth Barnwell’s “Estimated Future Net Revenues” from total proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves and the present value of Barnwell’s “Estimated Future Net Revenues” (discounted at 10%) as of September 30, 2018. Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated future expenditures of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assume the continuation of existing economic conditions. Net revenues have been calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date and current costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures (including abandonment

Undiscounted future net cash flows, after income taxes | $ | 22,828,000 | 
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 13,836,000 | *

_______________________________________________
*      This amount does not purport to represent, nor should it be interpreted as, the fair value of Barnwell’s oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwell’s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of $1.24 per Mcf and an oil price of $51.43 per Bbl) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates.
Oil and Natural Gas Production
The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell’s net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. All of Barnwell’s net production in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 was derived in Alberta, Canada. For a discussion regarding our total annual production volumes, average sales prices, and related production costs, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The 2018 volumes reflect volumes from the Twining acquisition only from the closing date of August 28, 2018.

Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions
Barnwell invested $10,890,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2018, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations, of which $10,362,000 was for the acquisition of oil and natural gas working interests in an oil and natural gas property in the Twining area. Barnwell also assumed $3,076,000 in asset retirement obligations associated with the Twining acquisition.
Well Drilling Activities
In fiscal 2018, we participated in a horizontal development well that was drilled in the Balsam area, in which we have a 22% working interest. This well was successful and started producing in July 2018. During the first 90 days of production the well has averaged about 180 barrels of oil per day, of which about 40 barrels of oil per day are net to Barnwell. This is estimated to result in a less than one-year payout and it is expected that an additional offset well will be drilled in 2019.
One gross (0.1 net) development well was drilled in fiscal 2017 and no wells were drilled in fiscal year 2016.
Producing Wells
As of September 30, 2018, Barnwell had interests in 73 gross (42.1 net) producing wells, of which 65 gross (39.4 net) were oil wells and 8 gross (2.7 net) were natural gas wells. All wells were in Alberta, Canada.
Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of both developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases which Barnwell held as of September 30, 2018.

 | Developed Acreage* | Undeveloped Acreage* | Total 
Location | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Canada | 182,439 | 40,728 | 88,229 | 17,322 | 270,668 | 58,050

_________________________________________________
*                  “Developed Acreage” includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. “Undeveloped Acreage” includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon.

Seventy-five percent of Barnwell’s undeveloped acreage is not subject to expiration at September 30, 2018. Twenty-five percent of Barnwell’s leasehold interests in undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration and expire over the next five fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 12% expire during fiscal 2019; 4% expire during fiscal 2020; 3% expire during fiscal 2021; 2% expire during fiscal 2022; and 4% expire in fiscal 2023. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration.
Much of the undeveloped acreage is at non-operated properties over which we do not have control, and the value of such acreage is not estimated to be significant at current commodity prices. Barnwell’s undeveloped acreage includes a significant concentration in the Thornbury (5,919 net acres) and Twining (2,904 net acres) areas of Alberta, Canada.

Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas 

Barnwell sells its oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, including under short-term contracts between itself and two main oil marketers, one natural gas purchaser, and one natural gas liquids marketer. The prices received are freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and are determined from transparent posted prices adjusted for quality and transportation differentials. In fiscal 2018, over 80% of Barnwell’s oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. Barnwell does not use derivative instruments to manage price risk.
In fiscal 2018 and 2017, Barnwell took most of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas “in kind” where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwell’s behalf. We sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids to a variety of energy marketing companies. Because our products are commodities for which there are numerous marketers, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. Accordingly, the loss of any single purchaser would not materially affect our revenues.
Governmental Regulation
The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production, environmental protection, and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province that periodically assign allowable rates of production. The province of Alberta and Government of Canada also monitor and regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal.

There is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the sale of Canadian oil or natural gas production. Canadian natural gas production destined for export is priced by market forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by Canada’s National Energy Board and the Government of Canada.

All of Barnwell’s gross revenues were derived from properties located within Alberta, which charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production within the province. Provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. Barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its oil and natural gas sales to parties other than the province of Alberta.
In January 2016, the Alberta Royalty Panel recommended a new modernized Alberta royalty framework which applies to wells drilled on or after January 1, 2017. The previous royalty framework will continue to apply to wells drilled prior to January 1, 2017 for a period of ten years, after which they will fall under the current royalty framework. Under the current royalty framework the same royalty calculation applies to both oil and natural gas wells, whereas the previous royalty framework had different royalties applicable to each category, and royalties are determined on a revenue minus cost basis where producers pay a flat royalty rate of 5% of gross revenues until a well reaches payout after which an increased post-payout royalty applies. Post payout royalties vary with commodity prices and are adjusted down for cost increases as wells age. 
11

In fiscal 2018 and 2017, 66% and 63%, respectively, of royalties related to Alberta government charges, and 34% and 37%, respectively, of royalties related to freehold, override and other charges which are not directly affected by the Alberta royalty framework.
In fiscal 2018, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Barnwell’s natural gas was 6%, and the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was 20%.

Barnwell's oil and natural gas segment is currently subject to the provisions of the Alberta Energy Regulator's (“AER”) Licensee Liability Rating (“LLR”) program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a Liability Management Ratio (“LMR”) for a company based on the ratio of the company’s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator. The LMR assessment is designed to assess a company’s ability to address its suspension, abandonment, remediation, and reclamation liabilities. The value of the deemed assets is based on each well's most recent twelve months of production and a rolling three-year average industry netback as determined by the AER annually. The AER has not recalculated the three-year average industry netback since March 2015 making the current value a premium to what most producers have been realizing. A recalculation of the value using current industry netback values would likely have a negative impact on our LMR. Companies with an LMR less than 1.0 are required to deposit funds with the AER to cover future deemed liabilities. At September 30, 2018, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. 
The AER reviews and approves the transfers of all well, facility and pipeline license from one operator to another, and requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This review process typically takes 30 to 60 days from the date of application. Application was made on August 28, 2018 for Barnwell of Canada to accept the transfer of the various licenses relating to the Twining acquisition. On October 2, 2018, the AER approved the transfer of all of the related licenses. As of the November 3, 2018 LMR report, we had an LMR of 2.09.
Competition
Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the acquisition and development of new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There is also competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources.
Land Investment Segment
Overview
Barnwell owns a 77.6% interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership that has the right to receive payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units by KD I and KD II within the approximately 870 acres of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area in two increments (“Increment I” and “Increment II”), located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments also holds an interest in approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A under a 
12

lease that terminates in December 2025, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification.

Barnwell, through two limited liability limited partnerships, KD Kona and KKM Makai, holds a non-controlling ownership interest in the Kukio Resort land development partnerships which is comprised of KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KDK. These entities, collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships,” own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort’s real estate sales office operations. KDK holds interests in KD I and KD II. KD I is the developer of Kaupulehu Lot 4A Increment I, and KD II is the developer of Kaupulehu Lot 4A increment II. Barnwell's ownership interests in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Operations
In the 1980s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed by an unaffiliated entity on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres, known as Lot 4A, zoned for resort/residential development, located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. In 2004 and 2006, Kaupulehu Developments sold its leasehold interest in Kaupulehu Lot 4A to KD I's and KD II's predecessors in interest, which was prior to Barnwell’s affiliation with KD I and KD II which commenced on November 27, 2013, the acquisition date of our ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships.

Increment I is an area of 80 single-family lots, of which 20 lots remain to be sold, and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki`o Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. Increment II is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. Two residential lots of approximately two to three acres in size fronting the ocean were developed within Increment II and sold by KD II, and the remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop the other areas of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II.
Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on the following percentages of the gross receipts from KD I’s sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I: 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than $100,000,000 up to $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess of $300,000,000. In fiscal 2018, three single-family lots in Increment I were sold bringing the total amount of gross proceeds from single-family lot sales through September 30, 2018 to $215,000,000. 

Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD II based on a percentage of the gross receipts from KD II’s sales of residential lots or units in Increment II ranging from 8% to 10% of the price of improved or unimproved lots or 2.60% to 3.25% of the price of units constructed on a lot, to be 
13

determined in the future depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior to improvement. Kaupulehu Developments is also entitled to receive 50% of distributions otherwise payable from KD II to its members up to $8,000,000, of which $3,500,000 has been received to date, after the members of KD II have received distributions equal to the original basis of capital invested in the project.
In fiscal 2018, the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships made cash distributions to its partners of which Barnwell received $735,000, after distributing $89,000 to minority interests. 
Competition
Barnwell’s land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Barnwell is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources.
Contract Drilling Segment
Overview
Barnwell’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources, drills water and water monitoring wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the distributor for Floway pumps and equipment in the state of Hawaii.
Operations
Water Resources owns and operates four water well drilling rigs, two pump rigs and other ancillary drilling and pump equipment. Additionally, Water Resources leases a three-quarter of an acre maintenance facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, a one acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and a one-half acre equipment storage yard in Waimea, Hawaii, and maintains an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies.
Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. The demand for Water Resources’ services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, its officers’ involvement in the community and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes.

In fiscal 2018, Water Resources started two well drilling and four pump installation and repair contracts and completed one well drilling and six pump installation and repair contracts. The drilling contract and two of the pump installation and repair contracts completed were started in the prior year, and the other completed contracts were started in the current year. Sixty-nine percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair

jobs, representing 58% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2018, have been pursuant to government contracts.
At September 30, 2018, there was a backlog of four well drilling and seven pump installation and repair contracts, of which three well drilling and five pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2018.

The approximate dollar amount of Water Resources’ backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at December 1, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

 | December 1,
 | 2018 | | 2017
Well drilling | $ | 4,600,000 | | | $ | 4,600,000
Pump installation and repair | 1,200,000 | | | 1,600,000 | 
 | $ | 5,800,000 | | | $ | 6,200,000


Of the contracts in backlog at December 1, 2018, $2,900,000 is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2019 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year.

Competition
Water Resources competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii, some of which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources’. These competitors are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources’ major method of competition; reliability of service is also a significant factor.

Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity or values of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2018 will continue.

Employees
At December 1, 2018, Barnwell employed 31 individuals; 30 on a full time basis and 1 on a part time basis.

Environmental Costs
Barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. U.S. Federal and state and Canadian Federal and provincial governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply, particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites where it has a working interest.
