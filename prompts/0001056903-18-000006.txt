GSWC makes no representations as to the information contained in this report relating to AWR and its subsidiaries, other than GSWC.

AWR makes its periodic reports, Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, and current reports, Form 8-K, available free of charge through its website, www.aswater.com, as soon as material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such reports are also available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. AWR also makes available free of charge its code of business conduct and ethics, its corporate governance guidelines and the charters of its Nominating and Governance Committee, Compensation Committee, and Audit and Finance Committee through its website or by calling (877) 463-6297. AWR and GSWC have filed the certification of officers required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Overview

AWR is the parent company of GSWC and American States Utility Services, Inc. (“ASUS”) (and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Fort Bliss Water Services Company (“FBWS”), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (“TUS”), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (“ODUS”), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. (“PSUS”), Old North Utility Services, Inc. (“ONUS”), Emerald Coast Utility Services, Inc. (“ECUS”) and Fort Riley Utility Services, Inc. (“FRUS”)). AWR was incorporated as a California corporation in 1998 as a holding company.  AWR has three reportable segments: water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has two principal business units, water and electric service utility operations, conducted through GSWC, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. FBWS, TUS, ODUS, PSUS, ONUS, ECUS and FRUS may be referred to herein collectively as the “Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.”

GSWC is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in 10 counties in the State of California.  GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”).  It was incorporated as a California corporation on December 31, 1929. GSWC also distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California through its Bear Valley Electric Service (“BVES”) division.

GSWC served 258,949 water customers and 24,274 electric customers at December 31, 2017, or a total of 283,223 customers, compared with 261,002 water customers and 23,940 electric customers at December 31, 2016, or a total of 284,942 customers. GSWC’s operations exhibit seasonal trends. Although GSWC’s water utility operations have a diversified customer base, residential and commercial customers account for the majority of GSWC’s water sales and revenues. Revenues derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for approximately 90% of total water revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

ASUS, itself or through the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries, has contracted with the U.S. government to provide water and/or wastewater services at various military installations. ASUS operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various U.S. military bases pursuant to 50-year firm, fixed-price contracts.  Each of the contracts with the U.S. government is subject to termination, in whole or in part, prior to the end of its 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract. The contract price for each of these contracts is subject to annual economic price adjustments. Contracts are also subject to modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations and additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases.  AWR guarantees performance of ASUS’s military privatization contracts.

Pursuant to the terms of these contracts, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate the following water and wastewater systems:


Subsidiary | Military Base | Type of System | Location 
FBWS | Fort Bliss | Water and Wastewater | Near El Paso, Texas and extending into southeastern New Mexico
TUS | Joint Base Andrews | Water and Wastewater | Maryland 
ODUS | Fort Lee | Wastewater | Virginia 
ODUS | Joint-Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story | Water and Wastewater | Virginia 
PSUS | Fort Jackson | Water and Wastewater | South Carolina 
ONUS | Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and Camp Mackall | Water and Wastewater | North Carolina 
ECUS | Eglin Air Force Base | Water and Wastewater | Florida 
FRUS | Fort Riley* | Water and Wastewater | Kansas 

*ASUS is expected to begin operations at Fort Riley in 2018 pursuant to a contract awarded in September 2017.
Certain financial information for each of AWR’s business segments - water distribution, electric distribution, and contracted services - is set forth in Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of American States Water Company and its subsidiaries. AWR’s water and electric utility segments are not dependent upon a single or only a few customers.  The U.S. government is the primary customer for ASUS’s contracted services.  ASUS, from time to time, performs work at military bases for other prime contractors of the U.S. government.

A large portion of the revenue from AWR’s segments is seasonal. The impact of seasonality on these AWR businesses is discussed in more detail in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Environmental matters and compliance with such laws and regulations are discussed in detail in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” under the section titled “Environmental Matters.”

Competition

The businesses of GSWC are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories.  However, GSWC may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which governmental agencies, under state law, may acquire GSWC’s water systems if doing so is necessary and in the public’s interest. GSWC competes with governmental agencies and other investor-owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms, availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis. ASUS actively competes for business with other investor-owned utilities, other third-party providers of water and/or wastewater services and governmental entities primarily on the basis of quality of service and price.

AWR Workforce

AWR and its subsidiaries had a total of 758 employees as of January 31, 2018.  GSWC had 549 employees as of January 31, 2018.  Fifteen employees of BVES are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which expires in December 2020. 

ASUS had 209 employees as of January 31, 2018.  Fifteen of FBWS's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers. This agreement expires in September 2020.

 other costs in connection with such events;

• | our electric division's ability to comply with the CPUC’s renewable energy procurement requirements;
