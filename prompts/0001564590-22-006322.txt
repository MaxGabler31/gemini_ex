Overview 
 DIRTT Environmental Solutions Ltd. is an innovative manufacturing company featuring proprietary software and virtual reality visualization platform, coupled with vertically integrated manufacturing that designs, configures and manufactures prefabricated interior solutions used primarily in commercial spaces across a wide range of industries and businesses. We combine innovative product design with our industry-leading, proprietary ICE® Software (“ICE” or “ICE Software”), and technology-driven, lean manufacturing practices and sustainable materials to provide end-to-end solutions for the traditionally inefficient and fragmented interior construction industry. We create customized interiors with aesthetics of conventional construction but with greater schedule and cost certainty, shorter lead times, greater future flexibility, and better environmental sustainability than conventional construction. 
 Our ICE Software allows us to sell, design, visualize (including 3D virtual reality modeling of interiors), configure, price, communicate, engineer, specify, order and manage projects, thereby reducing challenges associated with traditional construction, including cost overruns, change orders, inconsistent quality, delays and material waste. While other software programs and virtual reality tools are used in the architectural and construction industries, our ICE Software provides end-to-end integration, from design through order engineering, manufacturing and installation. Our interior construction solutions include prefabricated, customized interior modular walls, ceilings, and floors; decorative and functional millwork; power infrastructure; network infrastructure; and pre-installed medical gas piping systems. We strive to incorporate environmentally sustainable materials and reusable components into our solutions while creating flexible, functional and well-designed environments for the people who will use them. 
 We offer our interior construction solutions throughout the United States and Canada through a network of independent distribution partners (“Distribution Partners”) and an internal sales team. Our Distribution Partners use ICE to work with stakeholders, including end users, to envision and design their spaces, and orders are electronically routed through ICE to our manufacturing facilities for production, packing and shipping. Our Distribution Partners then coordinate the receipt and installations of our interior solutions at the end users’ locations. 
 Our name “DIRTT” stands for Doing It Right This Time. DIRTT was incorporated in Alberta, Canada, under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) (“ABCA”) on March 4, 2003.

 Our Solutions 
 We offer a wide array of interior construction solutions powered by technology that address the challenges inherent in traditional interior designing and construction methods. Unlike traditional interior construction, including traditional prefabricated products, our solutions do not have predetermined shapes, sizes or configurations, so clients are free to design any shape, size or configuration that is necessary to meet their needs. Our design and visualization technologies integrate with our manufacturing capabilities and enable short and precise manufacturing times. With a strong network of Distribution Partners, we are able to complete an interior construction project in as few as 30 days, from visualization and completion of design to installation and move-in. Because our solutions remain highly adaptable over time, clients are able to change and customize our solutions even after installation to maintain satisfaction with the functionality and aesthetics of their space as their needs change. 
 Sustainability practices are a core part of our business, from design and manufacturing to installation and beyond. Our solutions are form-fit, so the only waste produced at job sites is packing material, which is biodegradable, recyclable or able to be returned to DIRTT for reuse. 
 DIRTT Solutions 
 Our solutions typically are able to address over 90% of an interior space. Walls, doors, cabinetry, access floor, ceilings, power solutions, data networks, timber and medical gas components are all fabricated in our manufacturing facilities and shipped to the site for final assembly and installation. The following table provides a brief description of our primary solutions (together with related complementary offerings, “DIRTT Solutions”): 
 
 
DIRTT Solution | Description 
---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRTT Walls | Prefabricated, customized, modular solid or glass interior wall solutions that support new and legacy furniture, that include glass walls, doors or windows, and that support integrated technology for commercial, healthcare, education, hospitality and other industries and medical gas piping systems for healthcare.
DIRTT Millwork | Fully customized modular cabinetry that may be used in a variety of industries, including commercial, healthcare, education and hospitality. 
DIRTT Floors | Low-profile floors that allow quick access to modular power and network infrastructure, facilitating future adaptation and reconfiguration in both existing facilities and new buildings. 
DIRTT Ceilings | Prefabricated custom ceilings that increase sound privacy and reduce noise. In 2021 we discontinued manufacturing ceilings and entered into a referral agreement with a major ceiling manufacturer. 
DIRTT Power | Quick-connect, pre-tested adaptable power solutions that are prefabricated to arrive on-site in correct lengths with factory components ready for installation and use, eliminating waste and providing future flexibility. 
DIRTT Networks | Prefabricated pre-tested and componentized passive optical networks utilizing single mode fiber cables instead of traditional copper cables. Similar to DIRTT Power, data infrastructure components arrive on the job site pre-cut to correct lengths and with components ready for quick-connect installation and use. 
DIRTT Timber | Prefabricated timber construction for interior mezzanines, structural elements for low-rise buildings, and other architectural elements, including completely customized cross-laminated timber and glue-laminated (glulam) timber. 

 
Our DIRTT Power and DIRTT Networks solutions may be integrated with DIRTT Walls, and DIRTT Networks solutions may also be integrated with DIRTT Floors and DIRTT Ceilings. DIRTT Millwork solutions may be added to DIRTT Walls for decorative and functional purposes. Additionally, DIRTT Walls, DIRTT Floors, DIRTT Ceilings and DIRTT Timber may be integrated among each solution. 
 ICE® Software 
 Our manufacturing is built on a foundation of technology, the core of which is our proprietary ICE Software. We use ICE to sell, design, visualize, configure, price, communicate, engineer, construct, specify and order projects. ICE enables us to efficiently manufacture fully custom interiors while addressing challenges associated with traditional construction, including cost overruns, 
 7


inconsistent quality, delays and significant material waste. ICE also gives our clients control over the look, cost and timing of their interior construction projects. 
 Clients typically engage an architect or designer and initially design their interior including space planning, materials, colors, finishes, which are then often presented in two-dimensional renderings or a building information model (“BIM”). A Distribution Partner imports this design into ICE and prices projects in real time. Clients can make changes after the design is imported into ICE, which will immediately be reflected in the price quote. Throughout these iterations, clients can explore and walk through their proposed space in immersive and interactive 3D virtual reality, on-screen computer renderings, and floorplan details so they can more readily understand the design. Throughout every stage of the process design changes can be made easily and in real time. We believe this is a significantly enhanced experience for our clients as compared with the experience of reviewing a two-dimensional blueprint or CAD drawing or user expertise intensive BIM file. In addition to the ICE tools that enable these experiences at each of our Distribution Partners, we currently have four specialized virtual reality walk-through centers, including one at our corporate headquarters, that allow clients to use virtual reality headsets to physically walk through a 3D virtual reality model of their design. Further, ICE’s virtual and augmented reality technology, including applications for phones, tablets and PCs, also allows project stakeholders in different physical locations to meet in real time to visualize, move about, interact with, discuss and edit their future spaces from any location. ICE also provides the ability to export a BIM file for use in design reviews of an entire project consisting of non-DIRTT construction elements coming from many different types of software.
 Once the client is satisfied with the design in ICE, the specifications are transmitted to our manufacturing facilities, where the physical product solutions are created to the exact design standards and specifications set forth in the design. ICE’s detailed bill of material data output is key to managing the many aspects of the manufacturing process, including product inventory and cataloguing, price quotation, order submission, parts manufacturing, and production management, thereby facilitating the delivery of custom solutions with shorter production times. We allocate production among our manufacturing facilities based on proximity to the job site and available capacity. ICE’s information allows a project to be tracked in detail across the entire life of the project, from sales, production, delivery, and installation. The ICE file (containing a project’s bill of material and manufacturing data) generated during the design and specification process is preserved and can be used for optimizing future reconfigurations, renovations, technology integration initiatives and changes to a client’s space at lower cost than traditional construction methods. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to help clients envision and design interior construction projects and then build and deliver those projects faster, cleaner, more efficiently and with a better overall client experience and satisfaction than traditional construction methods. The modular aspect of our DIRTT Solutions allows them to be easily reconfigured with a minimal amount of waste as client space needs change. Our innovative, technology-driven approach includes outstanding product design that is customized for each client application and delivered on time and on budget. 
 Our strategy is founded on the following priorities: 
  
• | The identification and pursuit of client segments that benefit most from DIRTT’s value proposition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Client-centric, continuous innovation in DIRTT Solutions and our technology to enhance product differentiation and drive market penetration and growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology-enabled manufacturing processes that facilitate short lead times, a reliable client service platform, and outstanding quality on a cost-effective basis; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing development and support of our Distribution Partners to ensure flawless execution and a superior end client experience.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In combination with a focus on cost-discipline, a continuous improvement philosophy, and a focused approach to capital investment, we believe these strategic priorities will drive increased value creation for our employees, clients, Distribution Partners, and shareholders. 
 Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following attributes provide us with competitive strengths in the interior solutions manufacturing industry: 
  
• | Leader in Integrated Design and Manufacturing Technology. We believe our ICE Software is the only interior construction technology that efficiently integrates the design, configuration, and virtual reality visualization processes
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the manufacturing process. The use of 3D technology in a design environment, utilizing video game technology for real time decision making, is an approach pioneered by DIRTT.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy and Intuitive Software Interface. Our ICE Software is a fast, powerful tool with an intuitive user interface. Our software’s ease of use enables rapid time-to-value for our clients and collaboration among all the stakeholders involved in the design, reconfiguration, budgeting and manufacturing processes. Our use of 3D virtual reality and augmented (mixed) reality technologies enables clients to visualize and modify their designs before manufacturing begins, thereby reducing cost and time to completion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary Solutions Components. The physical components that comprise our DIRTT Solutions have been designed to provide clients with numerous options and full modularity. As a result, we are able to create interior environments that are fully customizable and not limited by a pre-set product list. The modular nature of our components allows them to be reconfigured easily, with minimal disruption to the occupants of the space and with minimal job site waste.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Distribution Partner and Sales Network. Our strong network of Distribution Partners and DIRTT sales representatives allows us to maximize our geographic reach, helps build brand awareness in the interior construction market, and enhances our positioning in our target markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Superior Results Compared to Traditional Design and Construction. We believe we produce superior client results as compared with traditional design and construction methods in sequencing, certainty, budget allocation, and outcome.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Effective Sequencing. Conventional construction generally follows a rigid sequencing process. Typically, wall framing is constructed first, followed by floors and electrical and data networks. This process is then followed by drywall installation, painting, and flooring, and then installation or building of millwork and fixtures. These steps generate significant waste and create opportunities for delay, change orders, cost overruns and rework. In contrast, DIRTT Solutions design and integrate the walls, floors and ceiling, including the finish, electrical wiring and data networks. They are manufactured off-site and arrive on-site organized, labeled and ready to be installed. This enables the interior solutions to be produced concurrently with on-site construction work, thereby reducing on-site time and the overall construction schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certainty. Our technology-based design and manufacturing solutions address changes in design, communications with clients, and material costs with more certainty than conventional construction methods, which often involve retrofitting electrical and data networks, change orders, uncertain timelines, and costly rework. Our controlled manufacturing environment reduces deficiencies and errors and produces more consistent solutions in predictable time frames.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Budget. Because of our integrated design, visualization and manufacturing technologies, we can price the effect of design choices and changes immediately and deliver the fully designed, manufactured interior solutions ready to install. This provides budget certainty both in the cost of our DIRTT Solutions as well as in on-site labor for the installation process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Outcome. Our interior spaces look like the images our clients expect from the design drawings and virtual visualizations, because those same drawings and visualizations drive the manufacturing process. Plumbing, electrical, A/V and data networks are integrated into the architecture of our DIRTT Solutions. For example, DIRTT Walls carry an aesthetic of permanent walls, but if an IT or facilities team needs to get inside the wall for any reason, they can use a tool to remove the surface of the wall to examine the wall cavity quickly, cleanly and quietly. This eliminates the need to knock down, and then patch and repaint, drywall or reconfigure fixtures and cabinetry. Our modular designs offer flexibility and interconnectivity with any technology, furniture, millwork or DIRTT Solutions that were previously used or that will be used in the future, allowing clients to reconfigure and repurpose their space while reducing disruptive and time-consuming demolition and waste removal.

Distribution Partners and Sales Network 
 We primarily sell DIRTT Solutions through a network of independent Distribution Partners working in conjunction with local DIRTT sales representatives, as well as internal DIRTT industry specialists, business development professionals and a dedicated Distribution Partner support team. Distribution Partners and local sales representatives are located in cities throughout the United States and Canada. The use of a dispersed network of Distribution Partners greatly enhances our ability to drive awareness of the DIRTT brand throughout our markets. 
 As part of our distribution agreements, our Distribution Partners are typically required to invest in their own DIRTT Experience Center (“DXC”) so that they are able to effectively showcase DIRTT Solutions. These DXCs are showrooms that provide mock-ups of 
 9


DIRTT Solutions and related product offerings. As well, DIRTT maintains DXCs in Calgary, Toronto, Chicago, New York City, Savannah, Salt Lake City and Dallas. On February 22, 2022 we announced our intention to close our Phoenix DXC.
 Our Distribution Partners operate under agreements that outline sales goals and marketing territories which are generally non-exclusive. We expect our Distribution Partners to build regional DIRTT-dedicated teams (sales, design and project management) and to use our ICE Software in the sales process. In addition to sales and marketing, our Distribution Partners provide value throughout the construction process. At the pre-construction stage, Distribution Partners provide design assistance services to the architect and designer; throughout the construction process, Distribution Partners act as a specialty subcontractor to the general contractor and provide installation and other construction services. Post-move in, Distribution Partners provide warranty work, ongoing maintenance and reconfiguring support. Local DIRTT sales representatives work closely with the Distribution Partners throughout the process to ensure successful project implementation and the highest client satisfaction. Distribution Partners generally place orders for DIRTT Solutions directly with us and pay us directly for such orders. 
 We have the ability to bring on new Distribution Partners in a wide range of geographic areas, which permits us to quickly establish a presence in new market areas. Our Distribution Partners also scale our virtual reality technology, such as our phone- and tablet-based applications, to fit their capacity and needs. 
 At December 31, 2021, we had a total of 69 Distribution Partners and 65 sales representatives across North America. We are not dependent on any one Distribution Partner or sales representative. 
 Manufacturing and Properties 
 Our DIRTT Solutions are manufactured at our facilities in Calgary, Alberta; Savannah, Georgia; and Rock Hill, South Carolina. On February 22, 2022 we announced our intention to close the Phoenix manufacturing facility and move related production to the Calgary and Savannah manufacturing facilities. This includes the Phoenix DXC as discussed in Item 1. Business in this Annual Report. Our wall surfaces (which we call tiles) are manufactured in Calgary and Rock Hill, casework and timber solutions are manufactured in Calgary, while aluminum, glass and power components are manufactured in Calgary and Savannah. Through distributed manufacturing we can shift production of some components among our manufacturing sites, reduce transportation times and costs, and meet targeted lead times. In 2019, we conducted an evaluation of our aluminum, tile and millwork capacities under various growth scenarios and concluded that the capacity of our aluminum manufacturing facilities is currently sufficient to support our anticipated growth. Given the longer lead time to acquire tile and millwork manufacturing equipment, combined with a lack of redundancy in those manufacturing facilities, we also concluded that we should commence construction of a new combined tile and millwork facility. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a lease for a building located in Rock Hill, South Carolina (the “South Carolina Facility”), which added approximately 130,000 square feet of manufacturing space for the combined tile and millwork factory. We substantially completed construction of the South Carolina Facility and commissioned the chromacoat tile line in the second quarter of 2021 with the millwork capabilities deferred until activity improves. In February 2022, we announced our intention to expand our tile manufacturing capabilities at the South Carolina Facility to include thermofoil through the relocation of existing underutilized equipment from the Calgary tile facility and back painted glass capabilities through the relocation of equipment from the Phoenix facility. Should the need arise, we have the right to lease an additional 130,000 square feet of space at our South Carolina Facility. If we experience additional growth, we may need to add or expand additional manufacturing facilities. 
Suppliers and Raw Materials 
 Our inventory balances consist primarily of raw materials, which are kept on hand as components of our custom manufacturing process. Managing our raw material inventory is essential to our business, given our short lead times from order to shipment and our high level of order customization. Our key manufacturing materials are aluminum, hardware, wood and glass. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, aluminum accounted for approximately 30.1% of our purchased materials, while hardware, wood and glass accounted for approximately 13.9%, 11.1%, and 7.8%, respectively. While we maintain multiple suppliers for key materials, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, one supplier accounted for approximately 59% of our aluminum supply with three additional suppliers providing approximately 14% each, two suppliers accounted for approximately 58% and 36% of our wood supply and one supplier accounted for approximately 44% of our hardware supply. 
 Materials are sourced domestically and, to a much lesser extent, overseas. Approximately 93% of our materials are manufactured and purchased in North America. Purchase decisions are made on the basis of quality, cost and ability to meet delivery requirements. We do not typically enter into long-term agreements with suppliers. In general, adequate supplies of raw materials are available to all our operations and to date we have not been materially impacted by supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, other than inflationary price pressures across substantially all of our raw material requirements, although aluminum purchases may be subject to market capacity constraints. 
 10


Technology and Development 
 We continue to focus on developing client-centric innovations and enhancements of both ICE Software and DIRTT Solutions with a primary focus on improving client experience, increasing market penetration and growing key markets. At December 31, 2021, we employed 100 employees within our technology and development groups and, including capitalized amounts, invested $11.1 million, $11.6 million and $11.3 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in innovation activities. 
Clients 
 DIRTT’s principal geographic markets are the United States and Canada. Our revenue is derived almost entirely from projects in North America sold by our North American Distribution Partners. 
 Our revenue opportunities primarily come from commercial projects, including both new construction projects and renovations of existing buildings. Clients range from small owner-managed businesses to multinational Fortune 500 companies across a variety of industries, including healthcare, education, financial services, government and military, manufacturing, non-profit, energy, professional services, retail, technology and hospitality. We view DIRTT Solutions as generally industry agnostic, with applications in many different industries with minimal adjustments. We are not dependent on any one client or industry segment. No single client represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. 
 Competition 
 The overall market for interior construction is fragmented and highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the interior construction industry include price (including cost certainty), speed, quality, customization and service. Our main competitors are comprised primarily of conventional construction firms, individual tradespeople (including framers, drywall installers, and interior product designers) and modular systems manufacturers. Additionally, conventional construction firms are beginning to develop customizable wall paneling and other interior construction solutions and may directly compete with our DIRTT Solutions. We also compete with commercial furniture manufacturers, such as Teknion Corporation, Haworth Inc. and Allsteel Inc., who offer a variety of prefabricated interior wall solutions. We expect competition to increase as new entrants or solutions enter the interior construction market. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
Seasonality 
 The construction industry has also historically experienced seasonal slowdowns related to winter weather conditions and holiday schedules, which affect shipping and on-site installation dates, in the fourth and first quarters of each calendar year. Our business has generally, but not always, followed this trend with a slight time lag, leading to stronger sales in the second half of the year versus the first half. Weather factors can also influence third-party exterior construction schedules and site conditions, which may in turn affect timing of interior renovations. 
 Due to the fixed nature of certain of our manufacturing costs, such as our facilities leases and related indirect operating costs, periods of higher revenue volume tend to generate higher gross profit and operating income margins while periods of lower volume tend to result in lower gross profit and operating income margins. Quarters that contain consistent monthly manufacturing volumes tend to generate higher gross profit than those where manufacturing levels vary significantly from month to month. 
 Patent and Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights relating to our products, production processes, our technology, including our ICE Software, and other operations. We rely on a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as patent, copyright and trademark laws, to protect our proprietary rights and competitive advantage. We register our patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate and take measures to defend patents where we deem others are 
 11


infringing on our patents. The following table presents the status as of December 31, 2021 of our issued and pending patents relating to various aspects of DIRTT Solutions and ICE Software: 

 
 | Granted | | Applications
--------------------------+---------+-----+-------------
Jurisdiction | Patents | | Pending 
Canada | | 66 | | 44 
United States | | 119 | | 22 
European Union | | 48 | | 27 
Singapore | | 22 | | 4 
Patent Cooperation Treaty | | - | | 8 
Other | | 82 | | 4 
Total | | 337 | | 109

 
Our issued patents expire between 2022 and 2039. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we develop innovations and new technology, we expect to file additional and supplemental patents to protect our rights in those innovations and new technology. 
 Sustainability and Environmental Matters 
 The construction industry generates a significant amount of waste and is estimated to contribute approximately 39% of global carbon emissions. In order to address the growing climate challenges and meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement, the construction industry has begun moving towards decarbonization and sustainable design integration. This includes sustainable material selection and offsite construction.
 Sustainability is an integral component of DIRTT's corporate brand identity. From our solution design and material selection to installation and beyond, sustainable behaviors are built into our decisions and processes. DIRTT's industrialized construction approach utilizes lean manufacturing methods and strategic material sourcing to limit waste production. Renewable energy is leveraged to help reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and solutions. Our innovations and products generally work with prior iterations, and our solutions can adapt to changing needs. We believe our projects help reduce the wastefulness present in conventional construction methods because our clients obtain customized spaces that can be more easily reconfigured over time and with higher recycled or recyclable content. 
  In 2021, we released our first Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) report outlining our commitment to sustainability and the environment, as well as providing full disclosure of our current environmental and sustainability impacts. As we continue to work towards the goals set forth in our ESG report and advance our efforts by setting new goals, we continue to better our business and solutions for our clients. 
 Government Regulations 
 The operation of our business is subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of various manufacturing facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state, provincial and local levels in both the United States and Canada. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigative or remedial requirements, or the issuance of orders limiting current or future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or industrial wastes have been mismanaged or otherwise released. 
 While we do not believe that compliance with federal, state, provincial or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations, we cannot provide any assurances that future events, such as changes in existing laws or regulations, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions related to our operations will not cause us to incur significant costs. 
 Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
 We may be involved from time to time in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, including matters involving our products, intellectual property, relationships with suppliers, relationships with Distribution Partners, relationships with competitors, employees and other matters. We may, for example, be a party to various litigation matters that involve product liability, tort liability and claims under other allegations, including claims from our employees either individually or collectively. We do not believe that any current claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material 
 12


adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. For additional information regarding our current legal proceedings, see Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” 
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted in April 2012. Certain specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements are available to public companies that are emerging growth companies. These provisions include: 

• | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about our audit and our financial statements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will continue to be an emerging growth company until the earliest of: 
  
• | the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | December 31, 2024;
--+-------------------


• | the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common shares that is held by non-affiliates (or public float) exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2021, DIRTT employed 1002 employees, 99% full time, 1% part time. We had 989 full-time employees consisting of 588 employees in production, 110 employees in sales and marketing, 100 employees in technology and development, 112 employees in operations support, and 79 general and administrative employees. At year-end, approximately 56% of our workforce are salaried employees and approximately 44% are compensated on an hourly basis. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of our workforce was based in the United States, and approximately 67% was based in Canada. Our 2021 hiring efforts were directed towards both our manufacturing and non- manufacturing functions. This reflects the build out of our commercial organization, accounting for 20% of our new hires, and streamlining our operations space, accounting for 59% of our hiring activities. The Company’s recent gender diversity data shows that 28% (2020 – 28%) of our employees are female company wide. In 2021 we hired 137 employees, with 36% of new employees being female. On February 22, 2022, we announced an intended reduction of our salaried headcount by approximately 18%. 
Diversity & Inclusion
 DIRTT recognizes the importance of progressing conversations and initiatives around diversity and inclusion. “Grow through diversity” is one of our core values. Our strategy encompasses leadership training around key topics related to unconscious bias, allyship and the value of attracting and retaining a diverse and inclusive organization. The strategy further focuses on the establishment and deployment of learning streams, mentoring circles and incorporation of inclusive language into our offer packages and benefit materials. Our efforts begin at the early stages of the employee life cycle, where diversity candidates are highlighted and

presented to hiring managers for review. We seek to hire based on talent, skill, capability needs and fit. DIRTT has also incorporated diversity into various internal programs including succession planning and risk profiles.
 
Culture & Engagement
 DIRTT has put measures in place to assess and enhance the level of engagement and satisfaction of our employees. Specific activities include the deployment of a performance management tool, catered to drive discussions around team goals, performance and development opportunities, and greater transparency around policy and procedures, tied to cost and risk mitigation.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, we introduced a leadership development program with a total of 146 employees registered that focuses on six core leadership competencies; feedback, communication, conflict, emotional intelligence, leadership presence and navigating change.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we deployed our company-wide engagement survey focused on core themes of meaningful work, supportive management, positive work environment, growth opportunity, trust in leadership and mental health awareness. Targeted initiatives are being put in place companywide to assess the progression of themes from the survey on overall employee engagement and experience.
 
Additional initiatives that we attribute to the progression of culture and engagement include launching learning and development opportunities, enhanced communication platforms, employee recognition programs, a company-wide philanthropic organization and a strong focus on virtual social events to further support engagement and connection throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Connecting to our community is a critical piece of the DIRTT story. We continue to focus on establishing a stronger community investment program that demonstrates our drive to put community at the center of the business. This involves developing a strategy, carving out a roadmap of initiatives and establishing a committee of employees across the organization. As part of our strategy, we are focusing our efforts on establishing meaningful engagement opportunities, creating inclusive giving campaigns, driving sustainable impact and enabling our employees to connect on philanthropic efforts. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we successfully completed our holiday giving campaign which was a coordinated in-person and virtual effort in support of food banks across North America, focusing on the cities in which we operate. The support for this campaign helped to reconnect DIRTT employees’ desire to give back with tangible outcomes for their communities.
 
Our core commitment to organizational safety resulted in a Total Recordable Incident Frequency (“TRIF”) of 0.5 in 2021 and 2020, more than 88% below the industry average and a significant improvement from 4.9 TRIF in 2019. Our enhanced health and safety protocols have been effective thus far in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 infections within our facilities and have helped us to avoid any material production disruptions.
 
We use a range of compensation incentives which vary by role, including annual variable compensation determined based on a combination of achieving team objectives and financial targets for the Company; quarterly bonuses for our manufacturing personnel paid on adherence to targets related to safety, quality, delivery, inventory and productivity; and commissions based on sales. We also use various forms of stock-based compensation as a retention tool and to further align employee interests with the interests of our shareholders. We monitor our retention by way of voluntary turnover, which was 15% in 2021.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, DIRTT established a business continuity and response committee to develop robust company-wide COVID-19 protocols and guidelines. Our COVID protocols encompass our employees, visitors and our contractors. The committee has prepared easily accessible COVID-19 guidelines for all areas of the business, including manufacturing, travel, client tours and day-to-day operations. In addition, we have established protocols for reporting and contact tracing, and we have a mandate to limit access to our facilities, offices and other spaces to only essential personnel to further minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19. DIRTT provides financial support to our employees who test positive or have been identified as a close contact. To ensure that our teams are healthy and safe, we have implemented regular fogging (sanitization) at all our manufacturing facilities and our head office. We have also implemented enhanced cleaning protocols (including the use of stronger chemical concentrations with a focus on high touch areas), increased signage, shift rotations in cafeterias, limited headcounts in conference and meeting rooms, and work-from-home guidelines and other best practices. We provide all our employees, visitors, and contractors with the required COVID-19 controls including personal protective equipment.
 
In addition, we have taken measures to address the mental health of our employees through a variety of company-wide initiatives. We have established a safety champions committee responsible for ensuring any employee or visitor coming into our spaces is briefed on our COVID-19 protocols and guidelines. Lastly, we have implemented an app for reserving workspaces to help

our employees adhere to our social distancing protocols, provide for greater support of contact tracing and ensure we adhere to capacity levels that will help us maintain safety protocols related to COVID-19.
 
None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced labor-related work stoppages or strikes, and we believe we currently have a positive relationship with our employees.
