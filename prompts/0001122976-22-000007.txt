ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
We are a premier formulator of specialized and sustainable material solutions that transform customer challenges into opportunities, bringing new products to life for a better world. Our products include specialty engineered materials, advanced composites, color and additive systems and polymer distribution. We are also a highly specialized developer and manufacturer of performance enhancing additives, liquid colorants and fluoropolymer and silicone colorants. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we,” “us,” “our," "Avient" and the “Company” mean Avient Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Avient was formed as PolyOne Corporation on August 31, 2000 from the consolidation of The Geon Company (Geon) and M.A. Hanna Company (Hanna). In 1948, B.F. Goodrich created a vinyl plastic division that was subsequently spun off through a public offering in 1993, creating The Geon Company, a separate publicly-held company. Hanna was formed in 1885 as a privately-held company and became publicly-held in 1927. In the mid-1980s, Hanna began to divest its historic mining and shipping businesses to focus on polymers. Hanna purchased its first polymer company in 1986 and completed its 26th polymer company acquisition in 2000. 
On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of the equity interests in the global color business of Clariant AG, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Switzerland (Clariant), and certain assets of Clariant Chemicals (India) Limited, a public limited company incorporated in India and an indirect majority owned subsidiary of Clariant (Clariant India). The business and assets are collectively referred to as Clariant Color and the acquisitions are collectively referred to as the Clariant Color Acquisition. In connection with the completion of the Clariant Color Acquisition and effective as of June 30, 2020, the Company amended its existing Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Avient Corporation. In conjunction with its rebranding and new name, the Company also changed its ticker symbol from “POL” to “AVNT”, effective at the start of trading on July 13, 2020.
Avient Corporation is incorporated in Ohio and headquartered in Avon Lake, Ohio. We currently have 102 manufacturing sites and eight distribution facilities in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa (EMEA). In 2021, we had sales of $4.8 billion, approximately 53% of which were to customers outside the United States. Using our formulation expertise and operational capabilities, we create an essential link between large chemical producers (our raw material suppliers) and designers, assemblers and processors of plastics (our customers). We believe that our role in the value chain continues to become more vital as our customers increasingly need reliable suppliers with a global reach and increasingly effective material-based solutions to improve their products' sustainability appeal, performance, differentiation, profitability and competitive advantage. Our goal is to provide customers with specialized and sustainable materials and solutions through our global footprint, broad market knowledge, technical expertise, product breadth, manufacturing operations, a fully integrated information technology network and raw material procurement leverage. Our end markets include consumer, packaging, healthcare, industrial, transportation, building and construction, telecommunications and energy.
Polymer Industry Overview
Avient is a specialty formulator within the polymer industry. We have the scientific know-how in material science required to bridge the large, commodity base resin producers and the companies who ultimately manufacture end products utilizing formulated polymer materials. 
Polymers are a class of organic materials that are generally produced by converting natural gas or crude oil derivatives into monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, and styrene. These monomers are then polymerized into chains called polymers, or plastic resin, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, in their most basic forms. Avient does not produce commodity base resins. Rather, Avient sources various resins, polymers and additives, then employs additional chemistry in formulating those materials into a highly engineered, unique material for a specific use. 
Thermoplastic polymers are characterized by their ability to be reshaped repeatedly into new forms after heat and pressure are applied. Thermoplastics offer versatility and a wide range of applications. The major types of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyester and a range of specialized engineering resins. Each type of thermoplastic has unique qualities and characteristics that make it appropriate for use in a particular application. 
Thermoplastic composites include base resins, but are combined with a structural filler such as glass, wood, carbon or polymer fibers to enhance strength, rigidity and structure. Further performance can be delivered through an engineered thermoplastic sheet or thick film, which may incorporate more than one resin formulation or composite in multiple layers to impart additional properties such as gas barrier, structural integrity and lightweighting.
 AVIENT CORPORATION


Thermoplastics and polymer composites are found in a variety of end-use products and markets, including packaging, building and construction, wire and cable, transportation, medical, furniture and furnishings, durable goods, outdoor high performance equipment, electrical and electronics, adhesives, inks and coatings and fiber. Each type of thermoplastic resin has to ultimately achieve unique characteristics (such as flexibility, strength or durability) suitable for use in a particular end-use application. The formulation science and manufacturing processes required to achieve those characteristics is the specialty role that Avient plays. 
For example, the packaging industry requires plastics that help keep food fresh and free of contamination while providing a variety of options for product display, and offering advantages in terms of weight and user-friendliness. In wire and cable, thermoplastics and composites serve to protect by providing electrical insulation, flame resistance, durability, water resistance, water swelling and color coding to engineered fibers, yarn products, wire coatings and connectors. In the transportation industry, plastic has proven to be durable, lightweight and corrosion resistant while offering fuel savings, design flexibility and high performance, often replacing traditional materials such as metal and glass. In the medical industry, plastics are used for a vast array of devices and equipment, including blood and intravenous bags, medical tubing, catheters, lead replacement for radiation shielding, clamps and connectors to bed frames, curtains and sheeting, electronic enclosures and equipment housings. In the outdoor high performance industry, plastic applications are used for components and colorants for all terrain vehicles and reinforced polymers are used for various outdoor equipment and gear. In the electronics industry, plastic enclosures and connectors not only enhance safety through electrical insulation, but thermally and electrically conductive plastics provide heat transferring, cooling, anti-static, electrostatic discharge, and electromagnetic shielding performance for critical applications including integrated circuit chip packaging.
Various additives can also be formulated with a base resin and further engineered into a structure to provide them with greater versatility and performance. Polymer formulations and structures have advantages over metals, wood, rubber, glass and other traditional materials, which have resulted in the replacement of these materials across a wide spectrum of applications. These specialized polymers offer sustainability and performance advantages compared to traditional materials, including design freedom, processability, weight reduction, chemical resistance, flame retardance and lower cost. Plastics are renowned for their durability, aesthetics, ease of handling and recyclability. Avient’s strategy and investments are aligned to enable these important benefits, now and in the future.
Avient Segments
We operate in three reportable segments: (1) Color, Additives and Inks; (2) Specialty Engineered Materials; and (3) Distribution. Previously, Avient had four reportable segments. However, as a result of the divestiture of the Performance Products and Solutions segment (PP&S) on October 25, 2019, we have removed PP&S as a separate operating segment and its results are presented as discontinued operations. Please see Note 3, Discontinued Operations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our segments are further detailed in Note 15, Segment Information, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Competition
The production of plastics and the manufacturing of custom and proprietary formulated color and additives systems for the plastics industry are highly competitive. Competition is based on service, performance, product innovation, product recognition, speed, delivery, quality and price. The relative importance of these factors varies among our products and services. Our competitors range from large international companies with broad product offerings to local independent custom producers whose focus is a specific market niche or product offering.
The distribution of polymer resin is also highly competitive. Speed, service, reputation, product line, brand recognition, delivery, quality and price are the principal factors affecting competition. We compete against other national independent resin distributors in North America, along with other regional distributors. Growth in the polymer distribution market is highly correlated with growth in the base polymer resins market. We believe that the strength of our company name and reputation, the broad range of product offerings from our suppliers and our speed and responsiveness, combined with the quality of products and agility of our distribution network, allow us to compete effectively.
 AVIENT CORPORATION


Raw Materials
The primary raw materials used by our manufacturing operations are polyolefin and other thermoplastic resins, TiO2, inorganic and organic pigments and specialty additives. In general there is adequate supply and capacity to serve our business. In 2021, we experienced certain supply disruptions, shortages, volume allocations and logistical delays for some of these materials, none of which had a material impact on our business. See the discussion of risks associated with raw material supply and costs in Item 1A, “Risk Factors."
Patents and Trademarks
We own and maintain a number of patents and trademarks in the United States and other key countries that contribute to our competitiveness in the markets we serve because they protect our inventions and product names against infringement by others. Patents exist for 20 years from filing date, and trademarks have an indefinite life based upon continued use. While we view our patents and trademarks to be valuable because of the broad scope of our products and services and brand recognition we enjoy, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any single patent or trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Nevertheless, we have management processes designed to rigorously protect our inventions and trademarks. 
Seasonality 
Sales of our products and services are typically seasonal, as demand has historically been slower in the third and fourth calendar quarters of the year. 
Working Capital Practices
Our products are generally manufactured with a short turnaround time, and the scheduling of manufacturing activities from customer orders generally includes enough lead time to assure delivery of an adequate supply of raw materials. We offer payment terms to our customers that are competitive. We generally allow our customers to return merchandise if pre-agreed quality standards or specifications are not met; however, we employ quality assurance practices that seek to minimize customer returns. 
Significant Customers
No customer accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and we do not believe we would suffer a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements if we were to lose any single customer. 
Research and Development
We have substantial technology and development capabilities, powered by approximately 1,000 associates serving in technology capacities, 100 of whom have PhD level educations. Our efforts are largely devoted to developing new product formulations to address evolving market and sustainability needs. We do this by providing quality technical services to evaluate alternative raw materials, assuring the continued success of our products for customer applications, providing technology to improve our products, processes and applications and providing support to our manufacturing plants for cost reduction, productivity and quality improvement programs. We operate research and development centers that support our commercial development activities and manufacturing operations. These facilities are equipped with state-of-the-art analytical, synthesis, polymer characterization and testing equipment, along with pilot plants and polymer manufacturing operations that simulate specific production processes. This allows us to rapidly translate new technologies into new products, helping us advance a more circular economy with reduced carbon footprint. Our investment in product research and development was $83.2 million in 2021, $59.8 million in 2020, and $50.6 million in 2019. 
Methods of Distribution
We sell products primarily through direct sales personnel, distributors, including our Distribution segment, and commissioned sales agents. We primarily use truck carriers to transport our products to customers, although some customers pick up product at our manufacturing facilities or warehouses. We also ship some of our manufactured products to customers by rail.

Human Capital Resources
“People” is the first of Avient’s four cornerstones of sustainability (People, Products, Planet and Performance), which, together with our core values and our four-pillar strategy, form the framework of our company culture. The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce as well as our executive officers and other key personnel. 
We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that guide our human capital management approach as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through a number of programs, policies and initiatives, as described below. 
As of December 31, 2021, Avient employed approximately 8,700 people, 34% of which are located in the U.S. and Canada, 34% were located in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 25% were located in Asia, and 7% were located in Latin America. 
Safety and Health
The top priority at Avient is the safety and health of our associates, and our ultimate goal is to operate injury free. Progress toward this goal is measured at the business unit and regional levels, communicated globally, and linked to a number of recognition mechanisms. In 2021, we maintained world-class performance for our industry, with a recordable incident rate of 0.55 per 100 full-time workers per year as compared to industry average of 3.50 in 2020. We continue to be recognized as an American Chemistry Counsel Responsible Care® company and set high standards for our operations as we strive to achieve our goal of zero recordable injuries. 
Employee Recruitment
We actively recruit and seek the best and the brightest talent through numerous channels, including job fairs, online talent networks, industry associations, referrals and campus recruiting. We recruit at more than 25 leading universities around the world and hire approximately 140 new graduates each year as full-time, co-ops or interns. We have launched seven highly coveted rotational development roles—from marketing to operational excellence to finance to IT—where newly hired associates rotate through various departments and jobs for up to two years, contributing their skills while also building diverse, well-rounded knowledge of our Company and its many stakeholders. We leverage global processes and systems to create a positive candidate experience with opportunities for both entry level and experienced hires.

Diversity and Inclusion
At Avient, we recognize the immense benefits that a diverse team brings to our organization, including delivering better business outcomes. Our talented people leverage their diverse backgrounds and skills toward a common goal: meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same. This spirit of inclusive collaboration can be felt throughout our Company. It drives the innovation that earns us leadership positions in the markets we serve and underpins the high level of respect we show each other every day. 
Our commitment to diversity begins at the highest levels of our organization, as evidenced by the fact that 42% of our Board of Directors are female or racially diverse. From a management perspective, 64% of our CEO's direct reports are female, racially or ethnically diverse, which we believe sets the right tone and expectation for diversity and inclusion within the Company.
More broadly within the Company, our diversity and inclusion approach is fostered by multiple Employee Resource Groups that are driving improvements and opening opportunities throughout our organization. The vision that guides our collective efforts is consistent and unwavering: to be the Company of choice for all. It is from this vision 
 AVIENT CORPORATION


that our Employee Resource Groups were born and flourish today. Each group has its own mission and supporting activities, and their efforts coalesce to help educate and inspire our global workforce and fortify sustainable business practices. 
Our Employee Resource Groups include: PRIDE at Avient (which is working to maintain a safe and accepting environment that enables LGBTQ+ associates to perform to their fullest potential and contribute to the success of our company), HYPE (which stands for Harnessing Young Potential Energy and is building a collaborative network of Avient’s young professionals), and LEAD by Women (which promotes diversity and inclusion by increasing access to the tools and resources necessary to build leadership skills and accelerate careers). In 2021, we launched our fourth Employee Resource Group called EMBRACE (which focuses on understanding and valuing the many diverse cultures and backgrounds of our associates).
The executive leadership team oversees our diversity and inclusion initiatives, which ensure that we have leadership accountability in advancing diversity and inclusion. In addition to bi-annual reviews with the leadership team, Avient has implemented recruiting guidelines to expand our diverse talent pipeline, with at least one-third of candidates being female or a U.S. minority. 
Other initiatives, including Mentoring at Avient and campus partnerships, are vital for progress in our diversity and inclusion journey. We require equality of opportunity for all qualified individuals in accordance with applicable laws. Decisions on hiring, promotion, development, compensation or advancement are based solely on a person’s qualifications, abilities, experience and performance, except where local law requires us to take actions to increase employment opportunities for a specific group. The Avient Ethics Hotline serves as a mechanism for associates to anonymously report any perceived concerns regarding these topics.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
We strive to remain competitive in the global marketplace and provide foundational rewards to attract and retain top talent. In general, our overall philosophy on compensation encompasses the following principles:
•provide all levels of associates with a compensation package that aligns Avient’s and the associates’ interests through the use of base and annual incentive pay programs;
•maintain a competitive pay program that serves to attract, retain, motivate and reward associates; and
•award individual pay commensurate with experience, level of responsibility, and marketability.
Associate Benefits: Awards and Recognition Programs
Our ongoing associate feedback is highly valued, discussed, and most importantly, acted upon to make improvements. This includes our culture and unique benefits we offer. In 2021, we continued to embrace and direct workplace flexibility and work from home arrangements to combat the spread of COVID-19 and protect our people. In addition, we continue to offer our global benefit of community service hours, where each associate is provided 16 hours of paid time off each year to participate in activities to support and help create more sustainable communities. We celebrate, reward and share our associates’ great work through our recognition programs, including those that all associates can earn for their extra effort and impact, as well as those that are specific to a position or role in the company, such as sales excellence. 
A Great Place to Work®
To gauge how associates at Avient feel about our culture, we conduct employee engagement surveys. Last year, our first full year as Avient, we surveyed employees in over 40 countries, and more than 130 locations participated, providing actionable feedback to support our employee engagement efforts. Based on positive feedback from our employees, we proudly were recognized as a Great Place to Work® for the third consecutive survey taken. 
Environmental, Health and Safety and Other Regulation
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that apply to the production, use and sale of chemicals, emissions into the air, discharges into waterways and other releases of materials into the environment, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste material. We endeavor to ensure the safe and lawful operation of our facilities in the manufacture and distribution of products, and we believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
We maintain a disciplined environmental and occupational safety and health compliance program and conduct periodic internal and external regulatory audits at our facilities to identify and prevent potential environmental exposures, including compliance matters and operational risk reduction opportunities. This effort can result in 
 AVIENT CORPORATION


process or operational modifications, the installation of pollution control devices or cleaning up grounds or facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable requirements.
We are strongly committed to safety as evidenced by our low injury incidence rate of 0.55 per 100 full-time workers per year in 2021 and 0.5 in 2020. The 2020 average injury incidence rate for our NAICS Code (326 Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing) was 3.50. We hold the American Chemistry Council's certification as a Responsible Care Management System® (RCMS) company. Certification was granted based on Avient's conformance to the RCMS's comprehensive environmental health, safety and security requirements. The RCMS certification affirms the importance Avient places on having world-class environmental, health, safety and security performance.
In our operations, we must comply with product-related governmental law and regulations affecting the plastics industry generally and also with content-specific law, regulations and non-governmental standards. We believe that compliance with current governmental laws and regulations and with non-governmental content-specific standards will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The risk of additional costs and liabilities, however, is inherent in certain plant operations and certain products produced at these plants, as is the case with other companies in the plastics industry. Therefore, we may incur additional costs or liabilities in the future. Other developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and related enforcement policies, including those under the European Union Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (covering Conflict Minerals), and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, the implementation of additional content-specific standards, discovery of unknown conditions, and claims for damages to property, persons or natural resources resulting from plant emissions or products, could also result in additional costs or liabilities.
