Item 1. Business.
Mission
To power energy independence.
Overview
We are a leading residential energy service provider, serving over 195,000 customers in more than 25 United States ("U.S.") states and territories. Our goal is to be the source of clean, affordable and reliable energy with a simple mission: to power energy independence so homeowners have the freedom to live life uninterrupted. We were founded to deliver customers a better energy service at a better price; and, through our energy service offerings, we are disrupting the traditional energy landscape and the way the 21st century customer generates and consumes electricity. Additionally, we believe the renewable energy market in which we operate, and investment in climate solutions more broadly, will continue to grow as the impact of climate change increases. While our core business model seeks to help accelerate a global transition to renewable energy, there are inherent climate-related risks to our business operations including, but not limited to, those discussed under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have a differentiated residential solar dealer model in which we partner with local dealers who originate, design and install our customers' solar energy systems and energy storage systems on our behalf. Our focus on our dealer model enables us to leverage our dealers' specialized knowledge, connections and experience in local markets to drive customer origination while providing our dealers with access to high quality products at competitive prices, as well as technical oversight and expertise. We believe this structure provides operational flexibility, reduces exposure to labor shortages and lowers fixed costs relative to our peers, furthering our competitive advantage.
We offer customers products to power their homes with affordable solar energy. We are able to offer savings compared to utility-based retail rates with little to no up-front expense to the customer in conjunction with solar and solar plus energy storage, and in the case of the latter are able to also provide energy resiliency. Our solar service agreements typically take the form of a lease, power purchase agreement ("PPA") or loan; however, we also offer service plans for systems previously originated by our competitors. We make it possible in some states for a customer to obtain a new roof and other ancillary products as part of their solar loan. We also allow customers originated through our homebuilder channel the option of purchasing the system when the customer closes on the purchase of a new home. The initial term of our solar service agreements is typically between 10 and 25 years. Service is an integral part of our agreements and includes operations and maintenance, monitoring, repairs and replacements, equipment upgrades, on-site power optimization for the customer (for both supply and demand), the ability to efficiently switch power sources among the solar panel, grid and energy storage system, as appropriate, and diagnostics. During the life of the contract we have the opportunity to integrate related and evolving home servicing and monitoring technologies to upgrade the flexibility and reduce the cost of our customers' energy supply.
In the case of leases and PPAs, we also currently receive tax benefits and other incentives from federal, state and local governments, a portion of which we finance through tax equity, non-recourse debt structures and hedging arrangements in order to fund our upfront costs, overhead and growth investments. We have an established track record of attracting capital from diverse sources.
In addition to providing ongoing service as a standard component of our solar service agreements, we also offer ongoing energy services to customers who purchased their solar energy system through third parties. Under these arrangements, we agree to provide monitoring, maintenance and repair services to these customers for the life of the service contract they sign with us. We intend to expand our offerings to include complimentary products to our agreements as well as non-solar financing. Specifically, we plan to expand our offerings to include a non-solar loan program enabling customers to finance the purchase of products independent of a solar energy system or energy storage system. We believe the quality and scope of our comprehensive energy service offerings, whether to customers that obtained their solar energy system through us or through another party, is a key differentiator between us and our competitors.
In April 2021, we acquired SunStreet Energy Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("SunStreet"), Lennar Corporation's ("Lennar") residential solar platform that focuses primarily on solar energy systems and energy storage systems for homebuilders. In connection with that acquisition, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we would be the exclusive residential solar and storage provider for Lennar's new home communities with solar across the U.S. for a period of four years. We believe the acquisition provides a new strategic path to further scale our residential solar business, reduces 
customer acquisition costs, provides a multi-year supply of homesites through the development of new home solar communities and allows us to pursue the development of clean and resilient residential microgrids across the U.S.
We also enter into leases with third-party owners of pools of solar energy systems to receive such third party's interest in those systems. In connection therewith, we assume the related customer PPA and lease obligations, entitling us to future customer cash flows as well as certain credits, rebates and incentives (including solar renewable energy certificates ("SRECs")) under those agreements, in exchange for a lease payment, whether upfront or over time, to the third-party owner, which may be made in the form of cash or shares of our common stock. We believe such arrangements enhance our long-term contracted cash flows and are complementary to our overall business model.
We commenced operations in January 2013 and began providing solar energy services under our first solar energy system in April 2013. Since then, our brand, innovation and focused execution have driven significant, rapid growth in our market share and in the number of customers on our platform. We operate one of the largest fleets of residential solar energy systems in the U.S., comprising more than 1,140 megawatts of generation capacity and serving over 195,000 customers as of December 31, 2021. For a discussion of how we define number of customers, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Financial and Operational Metrics". The following chart illustrates the growth in our number of customers from December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021.
Our Dealer Network Model
While many of our competitors maintain a large, geographically diverse base of employees in local markets, including a direct sales force comprised of home improvement installers, we limit the cost associated with that structure by utilizing a network of local, independent dealers to market, sell and install solar energy systems, energy storage systems, home generators and certain other products and services on our behalf. Our dealers typically reside and work within the markets they serve and provide a localized, customer-focused marketing, installation and servicing process. These dealers are often leading local solar installation companies, electrical services companies or companies that serve customers who are actively searching for solar power, backup power for their homes, complimentary services or who were referred by existing customers. When entering new markets, our dealer model immediately provides scale by enabling us to develop relationships with existing local businesses and avoiding the delay and expense required to establish new sales and installation offices. Similarly, because we do not typically maintain local offices, we can quickly refocus our origination efforts and capital deployment strategy to different markets in response to changing dynamics and regulatory developments. Furthermore, because of the low marginal cost to maintain relationships with individual dealers in currently unfavorable markets, we can maintain a strategic presence in anticipation of future developments that may make the economics of distributed residential solar energy in those markets more attractive.
Our dealers realize value in partnering with us for a variety of reasons. Although each of our dealer relationships is unique, we believe our dealers choose to work with us because:
•we do not compete with our dealers;
•we receive preferred equipment pricing as a result of our strong supplier relationships;
•we offer a wide variety of product structures;
•we provide easy-to-use software to dealers to assist with the installation process and to price potential solar energy systems and energy storage systems;
•dealers can leverage our brand and reputation for customer service to support their businesses;
•we provide comprehensive training to dealers; and
•we are a stable counterparty our dealers can trust to make payments on time.
Origination, Installation, Monitoring and Servicing Processes
Through our dealer network model, we provide a streamlined approach for the origination of solar service agreements and the installation of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. The principal elements of our origination, installation, monitoring and servicing processes are described below:
•Customer Origination and Consultation. Our dealers serve as a local, direct-to-home sales force providing in-person and virtual consultations to source potential customers in each geographic market where we operate. Our dealers reach potential customers through various means, including online, telemarketing, in-store sales, cross-marketing with complementary products and door-to-door canvasing. Using our technology platform and proprietary pricing tool, the dealer and the customer select one of our standard-form solar service agreements for the relevant market. Before proceeding to the design phase, we confirm that every customer understands the terms of their contract with us as well as the expected benefits of the system.
•Design and Engineering. Prior to the dealer's purchase and installation of the equipment, we and the dealers work together to design each solar energy system and, if applicable, energy storage system. All of our solar energy systems and energy storage systems are designed with equipment from a pre-approved list of manufacturers. We utilize our extensive tools and services platform, standardized procedures and existing databases to help our dealers comply with our pricing requirements, residential solar best practices, contract terms, and state, territorial and local regulations. For each solar service agreement, an individualized power production estimate is created by analyzing geographic, solar and weather data with the design's proposed orientation, components and shading. We continue to pursue technological innovation to streamline our review of design and engineering, to expedite installation and to lower costs for our dealers.
•Installation, Commissioning, Quality Assurance and Interconnection. The installation and commissioning phase requires the dealer to obtain all necessary permits for installation and complete our commissioning process for the solar energy system and energy storage system (if applicable), which entails submitting supporting documentation and photographs illustrating the installation of the solar energy system and energy storage system (if applicable) to our quality assurance team for review. Following completion of these steps and our approval of these materials, the dealer submits required paperwork to the applicable electric distribution utility to obtain permission to operate the equipment, schedule required regulatory inspections and arrange for interconnection of the solar energy system to the electrical grid. In some markets where either permission is not required and/or interconnection is not feasible or practical, we may place the system in service without interconnecting to the electrical grid and thereby place the system in service without seeking permission to operate from the applicable electric distribution utility.
•Customer Billing Dates. How soon we will begin billing the customer after the solar energy system has been placed in service will vary by product offering. Lease agreements will begin billing on the first cycle date after the solar energy system has been placed in service, generally within 30 days. PPAs will begin billing on the first cycle date in the next calendar month after the solar energy system has been placed in service, generally between 15 and 60 days after the solar energy system has been placed in service. Loan agreements require that the solar energy system must be in service at least 30 days prior to the date when billing can begin. As a result, billing on loan agreements generally begins the first cycle date in the next calendar month after the solar energy system has been placed in service.
•Monitoring and Servicing. Our monitoring systems utilize cellular or internet connections that allow us to confirm the continuing operation of the solar energy system and energy storage system (if applicable) and identify and solve maintenance issues through our dealers, third-party service providers or our own personnel. We also collect performance data to improve our pricing, generation estimates and services for our customers.
Our Relationships With Our Dealers
We carefully recruit our dealers, who must meet and maintain our standards to be an approved dealer. Qualifications to be a dealer include: experience in the residential solar industry (or success in complementary industries such as home security, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, electrical services, and satellite television), experienced and appropriately certified 
employees (including multiple installation teams) and possession of applicable licenses. We also perform a review of the prospective dealer's financial condition as part of our recruitment process, a background check on the principal owners of the organization and a careful review of the dealer's online and local reputation. Upon engagement, the dealer enters into a standard dealer agreement with us, which may be amended from time to time, that sets ongoing standards for operations and payment obligations based on different milestones for each project. We provide training, field support and continuing education to help our dealers operate efficiently. This includes training related to our processes, standards and services platform, sales training and compliance education regarding applicable rules and regulations. We actively review our dealers' performance and compliance with our requirements to determine whether to terminate our relationship with any dealer that is unable to meet our performance standards.
We devote significant resources to maintaining and expanding our relationships with existing dealers. Although most of our dealer agreements allow the dealer to sell services and products from our competitors, we believe dealers find our proprietary technology and operations platform, established supply chain group, commitment to training, quality of service and prompt payment to be an incentive to prioritize selling our services. Furthermore, many of our dealers may be hesitant to work with our competitors that have developed internal sales and installation personnel that may compete with certain aspects of the dealers' business. Taken as a whole, we believe these considerations promote long-lasting relationships with our dealers.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Trinity Solar, Inc. ("Trinity") accounted for approximately 15% and 28% of our net originations, respectively. In March 2019, we amended our agreement with Trinity pursuant to which Trinity has agreed to perform services or work exclusively for us for four years, with certain exceptions, including (a) the sale of solar energy systems to individuals on a "cash" basis that do not involve any third-party financing, (b) the sale of solar energy systems pursuant to customer agreements we do not elect to accept under the terms of the arrangement and (c) the sale of solar energy systems pursuant to customer agreements executed prior to the date of the amendment to the dealer agreement. In addition, Trinity may market, sell and install solar energy systems for our competitors in instances in which such competitor has provided the leads for such solar energy system customer directly to Trinity. Under this arrangement, we have agreed to provide annual bonuses to Trinity in the amount of $20 million in year one and $10 million each year thereafter, subject to clawback if minimum annual origination targets are not reached and additional per watt incentive payments if higher annual origination targets are exceeded. The minimum and higher origination targets increase by approximately 15% to 20% each year and limits competing work by Trinity to 10% of Trinity's annual gross revenues. Unlike most of our dealer agreements, the arrangement with Trinity does not permit the parties to terminate for convenience and only permits termination in specified circumstances including material breach (subject to applicable cure periods), prolonged force majeure events, a change of control, certain insolvency events or mutual agreement. For purposes of the Trinity agreement, "change of control" means (a) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a party or (b) any merger, acquisition, or other transaction or series of transactions that results in a change of ownership of more than fifty percent of the voting securities of a party (other than in connection with an initial public offering of either party or a transfer among Trinity's existing owners). Additionally, the arrangement provides for a $10 million liquidated damages payment by the applicable party in the event of termination for material breach, certain insolvency events of or wrongful termination by the other party.
We have similar contractual arrangements with several other key dealers. For certain other dealers, substantially all of the solar service agreements originated by such dealers are Sunnova agreements, although they are under no exclusivity arrangement. During the year ended December 31, 2021 Lennar and Windmar Energy accounted for 20% and 11% , respectively, of our net originations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Infinity Energy, Inc. accounted for 12% of our net originations. No dealer other than Lennar, Trinity, Windmar Energy and Infinity Energy, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of our net originations during 2021 or 2020.
Direct Sales
We have established an inside sales team to market and sell a limited set of products and services in circumstances where there is no existing relationship between a potential customer and our dealers to market on our behalf. This sales team is primarily focused on selling stand-alone solutions, such as Sunnova Protect Services, Sunnova +SunSafe, electric vehicle chargers, home generators and other supplements as requested by consumers. In most cases, these services will be directed to a third-party installer in our dealer network, as required, for the installation of any equipment.
Grid Services
We have developed relationships with various independent system operators, utilities, community choice aggregators and others, seeking to provide them with specialized grid services so these grid participants can more efficiently conduct their operations. Examples of these services may demand response as well as grid capacity and voltage management. These grid programs can make use of the solar energy systems, energy storage systems and other technologies installed in customer homes 
and managed by us via a centralized platform and internally developed software. By providing grid services, we seek to earn additional revenue, improve grid resiliency and operations where our customers are located, and lower the cost of power to our customers.
Platform of Tools and Services
We have developed a cloud-based technology platform for origination, installation, administration and servicing of our solar energy systems and energy storage systems. All of our dealers are trained in and use this platform. Our software platform includes a proprietary technology suite, including a contact center to assist dealers in lead generation, project tracking and service obligations, a quoting tool to standardize customer quotes and solar service agreements, and other services to manage payments, billing and monitoring. The technology suite also includes tools to streamline the approval process for the design and installation of solar energy systems and energy storage systems and establish a standard process for ongoing service and warranty management. The platform leverages cloud-based infrastructure and software capabilities using multiple third-party providers, including Salesforce, Amazon Web Services, Heroku and FinancialForce. It is compatible with multiple end-user device types, including smartphone, tablet and desktop/laptop interfaces.
We have invested in proprietary software systems and technology that have been designed to tie into third-party platforms and applications of our dealers and other systems. Our key software systems include:
•Pricing Tool: Customer pricing and quoting is delivered by a combination of cloud-based technologies including Genability, PV Watts (a service of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and proprietary applications running on Amazon Web Services and Heroku. This collection of tools is made available to us and our dealers through a web, tablet or mobile device interface. We permit dealers to generate solar service agreement quotes and proposal documents on demand for presentation to prospective customers. Each completed quote is transferred into Salesforce for solar service agreement generation, customer access and reporting.
•MySunnova: MySunnova is our online portal for customers that allows them to view their solar energy systems' production history, view energy storage system data, pay their bills, manage their online account and contact information, make referrals and contact our customer service team.
•Salesforce: Salesforce is our central repository and system of record for all contracts, process documentation, customer account information, maintenance information and payment tracking for the life of the solar service agreement. This single system allows for integrated and comprehensive reporting for the entire life cycle of the customer, from quote to end of the solar service agreement term. Many of our other systems interact with the Salesforce platform.
•FinancialForce: FinancialForce is a cloud-based accounting system built on the Salesforce platform. Because it shares similar architecture to our Salesforce system, FinancialForce allows for integration between our operations and accounting.
Cybersecurity
In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber incidents, we maintain a cybersecurity program designed to monitor, protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems, overseen by our board of directors (our "Board") and guided by external specialists. The program establishes security standards and guidelines for our technological resources and includes training for employees, contractors and third parties and testing by third party experts of our cybersecurity capabilities. As part of this program, we also maintain an incident response plan and retain specialist service providers under contract. Our current security posture and compliance efforts are intended to address evolving and changing cyber threats.

We focus on growing a geographically diverse customer base with a strong credit profile. We perceive our recurring customer payments as high-quality assets given the broad and relatively inelastic demand for electricity and because our customers typically have high credit scores. As of December 31, 2021, our customers had, at the time of signing the solar service agreement, an average FICO® score of 740. The purpose of our stringent credit approval policy is to ensure reliability of collecting payment over the duration of the solar service agreements. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 0.8% of our customers were in default (over 120 days past due) under their solar service agreements.
Our solar service agreements typically have an initial term ranging from 10 to 25 years. Our lease and PPA agreements typically include an opportunity for customers to renew for up to an additional 10 years via two five-year or one 10-year renewal options. The customer is obligated to make payments to us on a monthly basis, and we operate and maintain the solar energy system and energy storage system, if applicable, in good condition throughout the duration of the agreement. Under our lease agreements and PPAs, the customer's monthly payment or price per kilowatt hour ("kWh") is set based on a calculation that takes into account expected solar energy generation. The customer has an option of choosing a flat rate without an escalator or a lower initial rate with an escalator. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 57% of our lease agreements and PPAs contained a price escalator, ranging from 0.9% to 3.0% annually.
Our home solar service agreements are designed to offer the customer energy cost savings and bill stability relative to centralized utility prices, often resulting in an immediate reduction in the customer's overall utility bill, with little or no upfront costs. We provide our services through long-term residential solar service agreements in the following formats:
•Lease Agreements. Under the Easy Plan equipment lease, the customer leases a solar energy system from us at a fixed monthly rate that is typically subject to annual escalation. Under the LeasePlus New Home Solar Plan, the customer leases a solar energy system from us at a fixed monthly rate that is not subject to escalation throughout the term of the 
lease. Under the Prepaid LeasePlus New Home Solar Plan, the lease is prepaid upfront for the term of the lease. We own, operate and maintain the solar energy system under our lease agreements. In most cases, lease agreements include a performance guarantee under which we will refund payments or credit the customer if the solar energy system fails to meet a guaranteed minimum level of power production for specified time periods.
•PPAs. We offer PPAs with variable monthly payments or balanced monthly payments. We own, operate and maintain the solar energy system under our PPAs.
•Easy Plan PPA with variable billing. The customer agrees to pay for all power generated by a solar energy system at a price per kWh that is generally lower than the local utility rate. The monthly payment will vary month to month based on the system's actual production. The monthly rate is generally subject to annual escalation.
•Easy Plan PPA with balanced billing. This is similar to the variable billing option except the customer's payments are levelized over the course of a year based on an annual production estimate so the customer's payments are insulated from monthly fluctuations in energy production subject to a true-up at the end of such period. The fixed monthly rate is typically subject to annual escalation. Should the annual production estimate exceed actual production, the customer will receive a bill credit at the end of the applicable period and we may decrease the estimated production (and corresponding monthly payments) for the subsequent year. Should actual production exceed the annual estimate, we may apply the overproduction to a subsequent year or increase the estimated annual production and corresponding monthly payments for the subsequent year. The estimated annual production will not increase more than 110% from the estimated annual production for the first year.
•Solar 20/20 Plan Agreement & Covenants. The customer agrees to pay for all power generated by a solar energy system at a price per kWh that is indexed to the local utility rate but is guaranteed to be at least 20% lower than the applicable utility's weighted-average rate that takes into account the customer's estimated production. The monthly payment will vary month to month based on the system's actual production and that month's indexed rate.
•Fixed Rate Power Purchase Agreement. This is similar to the variable billing option except the monthly rate is fixed throughout the term of the agreement and not subject to annual escalation.
•Loan Agreements. Pursuant to an Easy Own Plan equipment purchase agreement, the customer purchases the solar energy system from a dealer using financing provided by us. The customer repays the amount financed plus a finance charge through monthly payments for a term of 10 or 25 years. We purchase the Easy Own Plan equipment purchase agreement from the dealer and agree to operate and maintain the solar energy system. We operate and maintain the solar energy system through our network of dealers. In most cases, Easy Own Plan equipment purchase agreements include a production guarantee under which we will refund payments or credit the customer if the solar energy system fails to meet a guaranteed minimum level of power production for specified time periods. Customers under our Easy Own Plan equipment purchase agreements have the option to prepay outstanding principal amounts, in part or in full, without penalty.
•Energy Storage Systems. Our Sunnova SunSafe program offers customers the option of a solar energy system integrated with a solar storage system. The customer can either choose an Easy Plan equipment lease or Easy Own Plan equipment purchase plan. These are similar to our Easy Plan equipment lease and Easy Own Plan equipment purchase for home solar services but include energy storage systems with the solar energy system. The customer may select a term of 10 or 25 years for the Easy Own Plan equipment purchase. These agreements have a production guarantee for the solar energy system, similar to the home solar service Easy Plan equipment lease and Easy Own Plan equipment purchase plans, except in Guam, Saipan, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Florida. Additionally, we introduced the Sunnova +SunSafe agreement to existing customers in several states and territories, under which the customer purchases an energy storage system (to be used in connection with an existing solar system) from a dealer using financing provided by us. Under the Sunnova +SunSafe agreement, the customer repays the amount financed plus a finance charge through monthly payments for a term of 10, 15 or 25 years.
•Sunnova Loan. The financing of energy-related products and services independent of a solar energy system is a new category launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 to meet evolving and expanding customer needs (e.g. electric vehicle charging, home automation, security and energy management). We have established a niche amongst pure financing competitors by providing energy-related products and services with competitive rates and tenors. Where applicable, our products come with a standard manufacturer’s warranty on equipment. Our Sunnova Loan offering gives our dealers the flexibility to offer additional products and services to customers outside of a traditional solar loan. Customers may select a pre-defined term ranging from 1 to 11 years.
•Sunnova Protect Services. For solar energy systems not owned or sold by us, our Sunnova Protect Services agreements provide customers maintenance and repairs as well as system monitoring and diagnostics. We provide three levels of service: (a) Basic, which is monitoring only; (b) Premium, which is monitoring plus repair and/or replacement of all equipment under a manufacturer's warranty; and (c) Platinum, which is monitoring, repair and/or replacement of all equipment under and outside the manufacturer's warranty and a production guarantee. The customer may select the level of service and a term of 1, 5, 10 or 20 years. Prior to commencing coverage, we will run a diagnostic evaluation on the customer's solar energy system and will identify any underperforming equipment and estimate production. The customer may elect to repair underperforming equipment, on a time and materials basis, so that it may be included in the coverage going forward. Should the customer decline to repair the underperforming equipment, it will not be covered under the Sunnova Protect Services agreement.
•Accessory Purchase and/or Roof Replacement. Customers have the option to purchase add-on accessories and services, including main panel upgrades, tree trimming, electric vehicle chargers and roof replacements, with financing options when bundled with a new Sunnova Home Solar Service or Sunnova SunSafe Solar + Battery Storage Service agreement.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 24% of our customers had lease agreements, approximately 35% had PPAs, and approximately 19% had loan agreements. Approximately 20% of our customers had service plan agreements, accessory purchase agreements or roof replacement agreements.
We have developed a standardized protocol and set of policies to qualify potential customers. During the solar energy system origination phase, we review the customer's credit application for compliance with our credit standards. Solar service agreements that are accepted must comply with our underwriting standards, which emphasize the prospective customer's ability to pay and the value of the customer's estimated savings under the solar energy service agreement compared to traditional utility rates. The exceptions are prospective purchasers of homes subject to the LeasePlus New Home Solar Plan, the Prepaid LeasePlus New Home Solar Plan, the Solar 20/20 Plan Agreement & Covenants and the Fixed Rate Power Purchase Agreement. These customers are not subject to credit checks and these agreements are freely transferable.
We maintain reporting and controls in place to monitor the timeliness of customer payments. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 91% of all payments received pursuant to our solar service agreements are collected via Automated Clearing House payments (i.e., the funds are deducted automatically on a monthly basis from the customer's bank account), approximately 5% are collected via automatic recurring credit card payments and approximately 4% are collected through non-recurring means. If a customer becomes delinquent on one or more monthly installment payments, we typically begin a collection process with respect to the customer.
In the event that a customer elects to sell his or her home, the customer's solar service agreement may be transferred to the prospective purchaser through prescribed reassignment procedures, subject to certain conditions related to the prospective purchaser's creditworthiness. To initiate the reassignment process, the customer must notify us of the pending sale, after which we will provide a copy of the solar service agreement, including any amendments, to the prospective purchaser. The prospective purchaser will then be required to complete a customer profile and a credit application. With the exception of customers originated through our homebuilder channel, each prospective purchaser's FICO® Score and Experian TEC Score (Telecommunications, Energy and Cable) will be evaluated on the same basis as a customer in a new origination and will be evaluated by our computer auto-decisioning system.
In the event that a prospective purchaser does not meet our credit criteria or elects not to be subject to such credit inquiry, the current customer will be required to prepay the solar service agreement in full or the prospective purchaser will be required to provide a security deposit in cash in accordance with such customer's solar service agreement or our transfer policy prior to the approval of the reassignment. Each such security deposit is held in a separate account until the earlier of (a) the time at which the prospective purchaser satisfies our established credit criteria or (b) upon 12 consecutive months of on-time payments following the date of reassignment.
On a case-by-case basis, we may remove a solar energy system and, if applicable, energy storage system from the property on which it is installed if, among other reasons, the solar service agreement is canceled or otherwise terminated, the customer or solar energy system and energy storage system is relocated, any of the component parts are damaged or the new homeowner rejects the reassignment of the solar service agreement upon home transfer, if applicable.
Monitoring and Maintenance Service and Warranties
Our residential solar service agreements typically are accompanied by a warranty and/or monitoring and service agreement. The warranty and monitoring services provided with each type of solar service agreement vary but can include operations and maintenance, equipment repairs, monitoring or site power controls and management for both supply and demand. Additionally, our Sunnova Protect program offers monitoring, service and production guarantees across three tiers of service for solar energy systems owned by the homeowner and installed by a third party.
Regardless of the type of our solar service agreement, we provide ongoing service during the entire term of the customer relationship, including monitoring, maintenance and warranty services of the solar energy system and energy storage system, if applicable. We have an operations and maintenance administration organization consisting of administration staff and a dedicated residential monitoring and production team that evaluates the solar energy systems' and energy storage systems' performance daily. When a performance or operation issue is detected via our monitoring system, we provide or arrange for troubleshooting or field services as necessary. We rely on our dealer network and our own personnel to complete the field services required to maintain the solar energy systems. After completion of the resolution steps, the maintenance administration organization verifies remotely the issue has been resolved and the system or energy service is performing as expected.
Additionally, customers under our solar service agreements receive a range of warranties on the related solar energy systems and energy storage systems, including warranties for module production and against defects in workmanship and against component or materials breakdown. We also provide the customers with a warranty on roof penetrations of up to 10 years in compliance with applicable state, territorial or local law. Through our agreements with our dealers, the dealer is obligated, at its sole cost and expense, to correct defects in its installation work for a period of up to 10 years and provide a roof warranty on roof penetrations of 5 to 10 years. Furthermore, we provide a pass-through of the solar photovoltaic panel manufacturers' warranty coverage to our customers, generally of 25 years, and of the inverter and energy storage system manufacturers' warranty coverage, typically of 10 to 25 years. We typically exercise our rights under the manufacturer's equipment warranties or dealer installation warranties before incurring direct charges or costs. Many service expenses are borne by our dealers and not us directly because of the workmanship warranty provided by the dealers to us. Additionally, many component costs are covered by manufacturer warranties.
Seasonality
The amount of electricity our solar energy systems produce is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Because shorter daylight hours in winter months and poor weather conditions due to cloud cover, rain or snow results in less irradiation, the output of solar energy systems will vary depending on the season or the year. While we expect seasonal variability to occur, the geographic diversity in our assets helps to mitigate our aggregate seasonal variability.
Our Easy Plan PPAs with variable billing, Solar 20/20 Plan Agreements and Fixed Rate Power Purchase Agreements are subject to seasonality because we sell all the solar energy system's energy output to the customer at either a fixed price per kWh or indexed, variable rate per kWh. Our Easy Plan PPAs with balanced billing are not subject to seasonality (from a cash flow perspective or the customer's perspective) within a given year because the customer's payments are levelized on an annualized basis so we insulate the customer from monthly fluctuations in production. In addition, energy production true-ups and production estimate adjustments for Easy Plan PPAs with balanced billing are calculated over an entire year. However, our Easy Plan PPAs with balanced billing are subject to seasonality from a revenue recognition perspective because, similar to the Easy Plan PPAs with variable billing, we sell all the solar energy system's energy output to the customer. Our lease agreements are not subject to seasonality within a given year because we lease the solar energy system to the customer at a fixed monthly rate and the reference period for any production guarantee payments is a full year. Finally, our loan agreements are not subject to seasonality within a given year because the monthly installment payments for the financing of the customers' purchase of the solar energy system are fixed and the reference period for any production guarantee is a full year.
In addition, weather may impact our dealers' ability to install solar energy systems and energy storage systems. For example, the ability to install solar energy systems and energy storage systems during the winter months in the Northeastern U.S. is limited. This can impact the timing of when solar energy systems and energy storage systems can be installed and when we can acquire and begin to generate revenue from solar energy systems and energy storage systems.
Intellectual Property
We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily a combination of copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S., as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on several registered 
and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we generally require our employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary technology. We also continue to expand our technological capabilities through licensing technology and intellectual property from third parties.
Government Regulations
While we are not regulated as extensively as a public utility where our business is conducted in the U.S., we are subject to various national, state, territorial and other local regulatory regimes. For example, in California and New York, we are subject to regulations concerning marketing and contracting promulgated by state public utility commissions. In some states, such as Arizona and Florida, we are limited to offering only a lease agreement or a loan agreement to homeowners and are prohibited from offering a PPA, which is deemed a retail sale of electricity in such states and can only be made by a regulated utility. In Puerto Rico, we are subject to regulation as an electric power company by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau and are required to comply with certain filing, certification, reporting and annual fee requirements. Regulation by the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau as an electric power company does not currently subject us to centralized utility-like regulation or require the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau's approval of charges to customers.
To operate the solar energy systems and energy storage systems, our dealers work with customers to obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local electric distribution utility. In many states and territories, by statute, regulations or administrative order, there are standardized procedures for interconnecting distributed residential solar energy and related energy storage systems to the electric utility's local distribution system. In some states, such as New Jersey and Massachusetts, certain utilities such as municipal utilities or electric cooperatives are exempt from some interconnection requirements. Provided that the system and energy, if applicable, qualify for the standardized procedures based upon size, use of industry-standard components, location on a suitable local network and other applicable requirements, utilities in such states or territories are required to interconnect qualifying solar energy systems and energy storage systems on an expedited basis relative to non-qualifying systems. Expedited procedures, when available, streamline the installation and interconnection process for solar energy systems and energy storage systems to begin operating. In the U.S. states and territories in which we operate, our dealers typically obtain interconnection permission on behalf of us and our customers using standardized interconnection procedures.
In certain states, such as California, independent solar energy producers who enter into lease agreements, PPAs or loan agreements with homeowners for residential solar energy systems are required to make certain disclosures to the homeowner regarding the solar energy system and the terms of the agreement and record a notice against the title to the real property on which the electricity is generated and against the title to any adjacent real property on which the electricity will be used. The notice does not constitute a title defect, lien or encumbrance against the real property.
Our operations, as well as the operation of our dealers, are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, territorial and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of employees, wage regulations and environmental protection. For example, we and our dealers are subject to the regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and comparable state and territorial entities that protect and regulate employee health and safety and the environment. These include, for example, regulations regarding the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes from the solar energy systems we own. In addition, environmental laws can result in the imposition of liability in connection with end-of-life system disposal, such as in connection with disposal and recycling of batteries.
We and our dealers are also subject to laws and regulations relating to interactions with residential consumers, including those pertaining to sales and trade practices, privacy and data security, equal protection, consumer financial and credit transactions, consumer collections, mortgages and re-financings, home improvements, trade and professional licensing, warranties and various means of customer solicitation, as well as specific regulations pertaining to solar installations.
For a discussion of these and other regulatory requirements, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulations".
Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state, territorial and local governments have established various incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives come in various forms, including rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation, exclusion of solar energy systems and energy storage systems from property tax assessments, system performance payments, accelerated depreciation and net energy metering, or net metering, programs. These incentives make solar energy system and energy storage system ownership more attractive to some homeowners and enable us to charge 
our customers lower prices to purchase energy generated by our solar energy systems and energy storage systems or to lease or purchase our solar energy systems and energy storage systems than they would normally be expected to pay for utility-provided energy. These incentives also help catalyze private sector investments in solar energy and efficiency measures, including the installation and operation of residential and commercial solar energy systems and energy storage systems.
Net metering is one of several key policies that have enabled the growth of distributed solar in the U.S., providing significant value to certain customers with solar energy systems for the electricity generated by their systems but not directly consumed on site. Net metering allows a customer to pay the local electric utility only for power usage net of excess production from the customer's solar energy system. Customers receive a credit for the energy an interconnected solar energy system generates in excess of that needed by the home, which is provided to the electrical grid. The credit offsets energy usage incurred by the customer at times when the customer requires more electricity than is generated by the solar energy system. In many markets, this credit is equal to the residential retail rate for electricity and in other markets the rate is less than the retail rate and may be based, for example, in whole or in part on the centralized electric utility's "avoided cost" for electricity that it would have had to generate or purchase at wholesale to meet the customer's demand. Furthermore, when coupled with a time of use rate program in certain electric utility territories, a homeowner may offset usage billed at lower rates with net metering credits provided at a higher rate.
For these reasons, net metering credits incentivize consumers to use distributed solar in certain jurisdictions, including some of those in which we operate. In some electric utility territories, any excess credits are rolled over to the next billing period and may also be cashed out later at a rate lower than the retail rate. Most states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam have adopted some form of net metering by statute, regulation, administrative order or a combination thereof, although some of these jurisdictions provide for a credit at less than the retail rate. In some jurisdictions, centralized electric utilities have also adopted net metering on a voluntary basis. Some of the states in which we operate, including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Illinois and Hawaii, have in place policies that limit or permit utilities to limit the amount of total electricity generated through net metering and/or solar energy systems, and some of these states, as well as other states or territories, including Pennsylvania, Nevada, New Mexico and Guam, have policies that limit or place conditions on the size of individual solar energy systems.
Net metering and other incentive programs are subject to legislative and regulatory review in many states and territories in which we operate and the availability and value of these programs could be limited, reduced or phased out. Some states such as Arizona, Nevada and Kentucky have reduced their net metering credits. Further reviews by these states and others are anticipated and the subsequent amount of net metering credits will continue to be assessed over the next few years in states that have net metering policies. For example, net metering rates in California, Puerto Rico and South Carolina are up for consideration currently or over the next few years. California is currently considering a proposed decision by an administrative law judge on a successor program to its current net metering program that, if adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission, would reduce the value of net metering credits from the retail rate to an avoided cost rate, impose a monthly charge on customers with solar systems, provide customers with temporary market transition credits and reduce the period under which legacy net metering customers can remain under the prior net metering programs from 20 to 15 years. The California Public Utilities Commission is expected to act on this proposed ruling in 2022 and may adopt or modify the initial decision or consider an alternate decision. New York is working on developing an alternative to net metering through a Value of Distributed Energy Resources credit that would allow certain customers to receive direct monetary compensation as opposed to a net metering credit. This program was expected to be implemented in 2021 but has been delayed due to not enough utilities having deployed smart meters that would enable an accurate valuation of distributed energy production. New York is keeping net metering in place with a nominal customer benefit charge added for solar customers installing solar energy systems after January 1, 2022, although that charge is undergoing a legal challenge and legislation has been introduced that would eliminate it entirely. As a result of the Definitive Restructuring Support Agreement ("DRSA") between the PREPA and its creditors submitted in May 2019, which is currently pending before the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, net metering customers in Puerto Rico may be impacted by transition charges and other requirements. Several legislators publicly oppose the DRSA and negotiations on the DRSA continued throughout 2021.
In September 2020, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") issued Order 2222 directing regional transmission operators ("RTO") and independent system operators ("ISO") to remove barriers to the participation of distributed energy resources ("DERs") in wholesale electricity markets on an aggregated basis. While the FERC's order is subject to challenge as well as further proceedings concerning the implementation of the order's directives in each of the RTOs/ISOs, Order 2222 provides a framework that once implemented will allow for aggregated DERs to be compensated through the wholesale market for the capacity, energy and ancillary services they provide. In late 2020, we began offering our lease storage customers participation in the ConnectedSolutions demand response program through EverSource and National Grid utilities in Massachusetts. We expanded these offerings for our Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Hampshire customers in early 2021, including loan storage customers. Our storage customers in California have the option to participate in the demand response 
market to help California manage its electricity demand, where we manage the battery storage system in response to price signals in the energy market for customers served by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and San Diego Gas & Electric utilities and work with Clean Power Alliance in Southern California Edison territory to provide demand response and resource adequacy. Additionally, we are leading a voltage support pilot within National Grid’s service territory where a portion of its fleet is increasing efficiency of the distribution network through a managed inverter program. Further, we will seek to participate in market specific opportunities and negotiate bilateral agreements, where appropriate, to enroll systems and customers in energy management and demand response programs.
Many states and territories have adopted renewable portfolio energy production requirements. The majority of states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted a renewable portfolio standard ("RPS") that requires regulated electric utilities to generate or procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state or territory from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a series of specified dates. In addition, several other states have set voluntary goals for renewable generation.
Roughly one-third of states with RPS policies require a minimum portion of the RPS be met by electric generation from solar energy systems, with substantial penalties for non-compliance. To demonstrate compliance with such RPS mandates, electric generation providers must submit SRECs to the applicable authority. One SREC is produced by one megawatt-hour of energy generated by an eligible solar energy system. The specified amount of energy is dependent on system size and when the solar energy system receives a "permission to operate" order. Electric generation providers can either generate their own SRECs through solar energy systems they own or they can purchase SRECs owned by other parties.
SRECs are a distinct product, separate from the electricity generated by solar energy systems. We and our customers apply for and receive SRECs in certain jurisdictions for power generated by the solar energy systems we own. As a distinct product from the electricity generated by solar energy systems, SRECs represent a separate source of cash flow from the sale of electricity. SRECs can be sold with or without the actual electricity associated with the renewable-based generation. Solar energy system owners are typically able to sell SRECs to electric generation providers, such as electric utilities, or in the SREC commodity market. We have hedged a portion of our expected SREC production under fixed price forward contracts. The forward contracts require us to physically deliver the SRECs upon settlement.
Several states have an energy storage mandate or policies designed to encourage the adoption of storage. For example, California offers a cash rebate for storage installations through the Self Generation Incentive Program and Massachusetts and New York offer performance-based financial incentives for storage. Storage installations also are supported in certain states by state public utility commission policies that require utilities to consider alternatives such as storage before they can build new generation. In February 2018, the FERC issued Order 841 directing RTOs and ISOs to remove barriers to the participation of storage in wholesale electricity markets and to establish rules to help ensure storage resources are compensated for the services they provide. An appeal of Order 841 filed by utility trade associations and other parties challenging the extent of the FERC's jurisdiction over storage resources connected to distribution systems was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in July 2020.
Some state and territorial governments, centralized electric utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a cash rebate or other payment incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy or energy storage system or to customers undertaking other energy efficiency measures. Capital cost or "up-front" rebates provide funds to solar customers or developers or solar energy system owners, such as us, based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer's solar energy system. Performance-based incentives and tariff-based incentives provide payments to solar customers or a solar energy system owner based on the energy generated by the solar energy system during a pre-determined period. These rebates and payment incentives, when available, improve the economics of distributed solar to both us and our customers.
The economics of purchasing a solar energy system and energy storage system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the IRS. This accelerated schedule allows a taxpayer to recognize the depreciation of tangible solar property on a five-year basis even though the useful life of such property is greater than five years. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that increases the return on investment from a solar energy system and energy storage systems. We benefit from accelerated depreciation on the solar energy systems and energy storage systems we own.
The federal government currently provides business investment tax credits under Section 48(a) (the "Section 48(a) ITC") and residential energy credits under Section 25D (the "Section 25D Credit") of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). In December 2020, the U.S. enacted the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (the "TCDTR Act") featuring significant tax provisions, including certain extensions and modifications of the Section 48(a) ITC and the Section 25D Credit. Starting January 1, 2020, the Section 48(a) ITC allows taxpayers to claim a federal tax credit equal to 
30% of the basis of eligible solar property that began construction before 2020 if placed in service before 2026. Under the TCDTR Act, the Section 48(a) ITC percentage decreases to 26% for eligible solar property that began construction during 2020, 2021 or begins construction in 2022, 22% if construction begins in 2023 and 10% if construction begins after 2023 or if the property is placed into service after 2025. IRS guidance as to when construction is considered to begin for such purposes includes a safe harbor that may apply when a taxpayer pays or incurs (or in certain cases, a contractor of the taxpayer pays or incurs) 5% or more of the costs of a solar energy system before the end of the applicable year (the "5% ITC Safe Harbor"), even though the solar energy system is not placed in service until after the end of that year. We are also able to claim the Section 48(a) ITC for energy storage systems installed in conjunction with solar energy systems as long as they are only charged by on-site solar. A reduced Section 48(a) ITC may be available for energy storage systems charged in part from sources other than on-site solar as long as the solar energy systems are charged at least 75% by on-site solar.
Until 2023, the Section 25D Credit allows an individual to claim a federal tax credit equal to 26% of qualified expenditures with respect to a residential solar energy system that is owned by the homeowner. This 26% rate was reduced from 30% for solar energy systems placed in service prior to 2020 and, under the TCDTR Act, is scheduled to be reduced to 22% for solar energy systems placed in service during 2023. The Section 25D Credit is scheduled to expire under the TCDTR Act effective January 1, 2024. The Section 25D Credit reduces the cost of consumer ownership of solar energy systems, such as under loan agreements.
Certain states and territories in which we operate offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy. Further, most of the states and local jurisdictions have established sales and/or property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements and credits. For a discussion of these and other governmental incentives, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulations".
Competition
We believe our primary competitors are centralized electric utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers. We compete with these centralized electric utilities primarily based on price (cents per kWh), predictability of future prices (by providing pre-determined annual price escalations, where applicable), reliability and the ease by which customers can switch to electricity generated by solar energy systems. We believe we compete favorably with centralized electric utilities based on these factors in the states and territories where our solar service agreements are offered.
We also compete with retail electric providers and independent power producers that are not regulated like centralized electric utilities but have access to the centralized utilities' electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state, territorial and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Furthermore, we compete with solar companies with vertically integrated business models, such as Sunrun Inc. and SunPower Corporation. In addition, we compete with other solar companies who sell or finance products directly to consumers, inclusive of programs like Property-Assessed Clean Energy, such as Goodleap, LLC and Mosaic, Inc. For example, we face competition from solar installation businesses that seek financing from external parties or utilize competitive loan products or state and local programs. In the future, we may also compete with solar companies that have business models similar to our own, some of which are marketed to potential customers by our dealers. We compete with these companies based on the competitiveness of the products, the overall customer relationship and the commissions we are willing to pay dealers for the origination of new customers.
Suppliers
The major components of the solar energy systems include solar photovoltaic panels that turn sunlight into direct current ("DC") electricity, inverters that convert solar-generated DC electricity into alternating current ("AC") electricity, the form of energy used by most standard household appliances, racking systems that attach the solar photovoltaic panels to the roof or ground, a remote monitoring system that measures and monitors all energy generated by the solar energy system and provides alerts about system performance and, in some cases, an energy storage system that stores excess energy generated by the photovoltaic panels to supplement energy supply during hours when energy consumption exceeds energy produced by the photovoltaic panels. The solar energy system may also be connected to the electrical grid or other supplemental energy sources, such as fuel cells and generators, with additional wiring and electrical hardware.
We require our dealers to choose all major components of the solar energy system or energy storage system from a pre-approved list of manufacturers and models. By allowing dealers to choose from several manufacturers and models without direct supplier obligations, we have greater flexibility to satisfy customer demand, ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply of components and reduce the concentration of warranty risks. We have entered into master contractual arrangements with each vendor on our pre-approved list of vendors that defines the general terms and conditions of our purchases and those of our dealers, including warranties, product specifications, indemnities, delivery and certain other terms. Our dealers typically 
purchase solar panels and inverters on an as-needed basis from our pre-approved suppliers at then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders having the benefit of our master contractual arrangements. At times, we will also procure equipment directly and sell it to our dealers.
For installations of solar energy systems on new homes, we negotiate pricing directly with the manufacturers for all components used in the solar energy systems. Based upon our production planning model we position and deliver the material on a just-in-time basis to our dealers to meet the home builder requirements.
We evaluate and qualify our manufacturers and their product offerings based on total cost of ownership, reliability, warranty coverage, credit quality and other factors. All equipment must be listed on the California Energy Commission's SB1 List of Eligible Equipment. All approved solar photovoltaic panels must have a minimum 25-year power warranty and 10-year workmanship warranty. We also require approved solar photovoltaic panels to undergo extended reliability testing as an indication of a 25-year or greater lifetime. Beginning in April 2016, we required all our manufacturers carry a 25-year warranty, or offer a warranty extension to 25 years, on all product offerings to be eligible for inclusion on our approved vendor list. Prior to April 2016, we sourced inverter manufacturers offering a warranty of no less than 10 years. All approved racking systems are required to be solar energy system Fire Class Rated "A" with a Type 1 module per recent California Fire requirements. Additionally, the racking system must have a Professional Engineers stamp as proof of structural analysis and wind speed certification and the racking system must be certified as conforming to the integrated grounding and bonding requirements of UL Subject 2703. All replacement parts and components must meet or exceed the same standards as those of the original installation.
In September 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") determined to modify its prior actions in its investigation into certain acts, policies and practices of the government of China related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 by imposing an additional 10% duty on $200 billion worth of products from China, including inverters. In May 2019, the tariffs were increased from 10% to 25% and may be raised by the USTR in the future. If inverter production is not shifted to other countries before any tariff rate increase on these products, the price of inverters could increase. However, the cost of solar photovoltaic panels and inverters generally do not comprise a meaningful portion of our operating expenses. In addition, many of the solar photovoltaic panel and inverter manufacturers on our approved vendor list are from countries other than China, including Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Vietnam and Malaysia. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Solar Industry—Increases in the cost or reduction in supply of solar energy system and energy storage system components due to tariffs or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations". These tariffs have not had a material impact on our business or our operations.

We recognize the diversity of our customers, employees and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our human resources department is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, retention, employee relations, compensation and benefits planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board and its committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our inclusion and diversity programs and initiatives. Our management team regularly reports to the Board regarding programs and initiatives, including compensation, healthcare and other benefits, turnover and retention, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our audit committee works closely with our enterprise risk management function to monitor current and emerging labor and human capital management risks and to mitigate exposure to those risks. Our nominating and corporate governance committee has oversight of our environmental, social and corporate governance practices and procedures and regularly evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include employee-related issues. Our compensation committee has oversight of the development, implementation and effectiveness of all pay and benefit programs, as well as succession planning. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees and their oversight are part of the broader framework that guides how Sunnova attracts, retains and develops a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.
We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our company an employer of choice. The results are shared with our employees and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in employee engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues, such as retention, harassment and bullying and safety, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks. Our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") regularly holds townhalls with employees to discuss operating results, announce important initiatives, recognize employees for years of service milestones and respond to employee questions. Employees are also encouraged to report compliance and ethics issues through our anonymous hotline if they feel uncomfortable speaking directly to their supervisor or management.
Comprehensive Benefits
We believe in investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. We also offer comprehensive and competitive benefits to protect the health, wellbeing and financial security of our employees. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with our stockholders, eligible non-executive employees are able to participate in our broad-based stock incentive program.
Training and Support
To help our employees succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These opportunities are offered through e-learning, online/classroom training, online performance management and goal setting, one-on-one coaching, individual development planning and group training initiatives and cover a variety of topics, such as ethics, code of conduct, insider trading and workplace harassment.
Safety
We take our responsibility to ensure the health and safety of our employees very seriously. Our objective is for all employees and contractors to be free of work-related injuries, which are costly and often preventable. It is our goal every person goes home each day free from accidents and injuries. To that end, we have developed a detailed safety program that includes, but is not limited to, working at heights and roof safety protocols, motor vehicle safe driving operations, electric shock mitigation procedures and pre-storm weather hazard monitoring in the areas in which we operate.
With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and as a designated essential service, we have adopted safety guidelines and practices that have enabled us to maintain business continuity and keep our employees safe. These practices have included retaining the services and assistance of a reputable health, safety and security advisory consulting firm, ongoing safety and health training for existing and new employees, remote working, adjusted attendance policies, health screening of employees for reported exposure or symptoms, enforcing mandatory periods of self-isolation, contact tracing, provisions for mask wearing, modifications to the in-office work environment, social distancing, increased sanitation stations and increased cleaning of offices and workstations. Our Board and management continue to monitor the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic very closely, including the effect on internal controls over financial reporting and information technology security. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Company Overview—Recent Developments" for additional information regarding our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employee Base
