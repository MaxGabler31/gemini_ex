Item 1.    Business 
OUR COMPANY
Installed Building Products, Inc. (“IBP”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company” and “we,” “us” and “our”) primarily install insulation for residential and commercial builders located in the continental United States. We are also a diversified installer of complementary building products including waterproofing, fire-stopping, fireproofing, garage doors, rain gutters, window blinds, shower doors, closet shelving and mirrors and other products.
We offer our portfolio of services from our national network of over 210 branch locations serving all 48 continental states and the District of Columbia. The vast majority of our sales are derived from the service-based installation of various products in the residential new construction, repair and remodel and commercial construction end markets. Each of our branches has the capacity to serve all of our end markets. We believe we have the number one or two market position for new single-family insulation installation in more than half of the markets in which we operate based on permits issued in those markets. We are committed to delivering quality installation with a commitment to safety, corporate social responsibility and total customer satisfaction.
IBP was formed as a Delaware corporation on October 28, 2011, however our business began in 1977 with one location in Columbus, Ohio. In the late 1990s, we began our acquisition strategy with the goal of creating a national platform and have grown to become one of the nation's largest installers of insulation in the residential new construction market. Since 1999, we have successfully completed and integrated over 180 acquisitions, which has allowed us to generate significant scale and to diversify our product offerings while expanding into some of the most attractive new construction markets in the United States. We believe we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow our business due to our strong balance sheet, liquidity and acquisition strategy. For a further discussion of our industry and trends affecting our industry, please refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, "Key Factors Affecting our Operating Results" in this Form 10-K.
OUR OPERATIONS
We manage all aspects of the installation process for our customers, from our direct purchase and receipt of materials from national manufacturers to our timely supply of materials to job sites and quality installation. Installation of insulation is a critical phase in the construction process, as certain interior work cannot begin until the insulation phase passes inspection.
Our business model is differentiated and creates value by streamlining the typical value chain. In a typical building products value chain, manufacturers rely on multiple distributors to purchase product. Distributors serve multiple wholesale and retail accounts who in turn sell to local contractors that perform the installation. We buy most of the products that we use in our business direct from manufacturers which are delivered to our local installation operations.
Insulation
Overview
We are a provider of energy efficiency solutions to our customers through our primary line of business of installing insulation. Insulation installation comprised approximately 64% of our net revenue of $2.0 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We handle every stage of the installation process, including material procurement, project scheduling and logistics, multi-phase professional installation, quality inspection, waste management and recycling.
Insulation Materials
We offer a wide range of insulation materials consisting of:
•Fiberglass and Cellulose Insulation – Fiberglass insulation is made of fibrous glass that is held together by a thermoset resin creating insulating air pockets. It is typically comprised of an average of 50% recycled material, with some products containing up to 80% recycled material. It is primarily available in two forms: batts (also referred to as blankets) and loosefill (also referred to as blown in). Fiberglass is the most widely used residential insulation material 
in the United States. Cellulose insulation is made primarily of waste paper and cardboard and has a composition of at least 75% recycled content. Cellulose is only available in loosefill form and is blown into the structure with specialized equipment. Fiberglass and cellulose insulation accounted for approximately 85% of our insulation sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.
•Spray Foam Insulation – Spray foam insulation, which is generally a polyurethane foam, is applied at a job site by mixing two chemical components together in specialized application equipment. While typically having the highest insulating value per inch and sealing effectiveness of all insulation materials that we offer, spray foam is also typically the most expensive on an installed basis. Spray foam insulation accounted for approximately 15% of our insulation sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Insulation Installation Applications
Local building codes typically require the installation of insulation in multiple areas of a structure. Each of these areas is frequently referred to as a phase of the insulation installation process and requires a separate trip to the job site by our installers at different points in the construction of a structure. Building practice and the inspection process differ geographically and require our involvement at different times during the construction process. We assist the builders with coordinating inspections. We install insulation and sealant materials in many areas of a structure, including:
•Basement and Crawl Space – These spaces often account for the second most energy loss in a residential structure.
•Building Envelope – We insulate the exterior walls of both residential and commercial structures by applying insulation on the wall or between the studs.
•Attic – We insulate the attics of new and existing residential structures. The attic is the area where the most energy may be lost in a home.
•Acoustical – Many builder or architect specifications call for acoustical insulation for sound reduction purposes in both residential and commercial structures. This product is generally installed in the interior walls to minimize sound transmission.
In each of these applications, we typically use fiberglass batts, except in attic installations where we typically install loosefill fiberglass or cellulose. We also install a wide variety of advanced caulk and sealant products that control air infiltration in residential and commercial buildings to enhance energy efficiency, improve comfort and meet increasingly stringent energy code requirements.
Waterproofing
Some of our locations install waterproofing, caulking and moisture protection systems for commercial and industrial construction projects. We offer a variety of waterproofing options, including, but not limited to, sheet and hot applied waterproofing membranes, deck coating systems, bentonite systems and air & vapor systems. The installation and service of waterproofing comprised approximately 7% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Shower Doors, Closet Shelving and Mirrors
Some of our locations install a variety of shower enclosures, ranging from basic sliding door designs to complex custom designs. We have the ability to meet our customers’ diverse needs by customizing shower enclosures by size and style according to their specifications, including framing, hardware and glass options. We design and install closet shelving systems in select markets utilizing some of the highest quality products available from national brands. We also offer standard and custom designed mirrors for our customers. Shower doors, closet shelving and mirror installations comprised approximately 7% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Garage Doors
Some of our locations install and service garage doors and openers for new residential construction builders, homeowners and commercial customers. We offer a variety of options from some of the best-known garage door brands. We offer steel, aluminum, wood and vinyl garage doors as well as opener systems. Unlike the other products we install, the garage door business has an ongoing aftermarket service component, which represented approximately one-quarter of the net revenue 
resulting from garage doors for the year ended December 31, 2021. The installation and service of garage doors comprised approximately 5% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Rain Gutters
Some of our locations install a wide range of rain gutters, which direct water from a home’s roof away from the structure and foundation. Rain gutters are typically constructed from aluminum or copper and are available in a wide variety of colors, shapes and widths. They are generally assembled on the job site using specialized equipment. The installation of rain gutters comprised approximately 4% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Fire-stopping and Fireproofing
Some of our locations install fire-stopping systems, including fire-rated joint assemblies, perimeter fire containment, and smoke and fire containment systems. Fire-stopping is a passive fire protection approach that relies on compartmentalization of various building components, including fire-rated walls, joints, and floors. The installation of these products collectively comprised approximately 3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Window Blinds
Some of our locations install different types of window blinds, including cordless blinds, shades and shutters. The installation of window blinds comprised approximately 3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other Building Products
Some of our locations install other complementary building products, none of which is an individually significant percentage of net revenue. Installation of other building products comprised approximately 7% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Sales and Marketing
We seek to attract and retain customers through exceptional customer service, superior installation quality, broad service offerings and competitive pricing. Our strategy is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships. We also capitalize on cross-selling opportunities from existing customer relationships and identifying situations where customers may benefit from more than one of our installation service offerings. By executing this strategy, we believe we can continue to generate incremental sales volumes with new and existing customers.
Experienced sales and service professionals are important to our customer growth and increasing our profitability. Retaining and motivating local employees has been an important component of our acquisition and operating strategies. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 700 sales professionals and our sales force has spent an average of approximately ten years with our operations. The local sales staff, which is generally led by the branch manager, is responsible for maintaining relationships with our customers. These local teams work diligently to increase sales by supporting our existing customers with excellent service and value while also pursuing new customers with competitive offerings. In addition to the efforts of our sales staff, we market our product and service offerings on the internet, in the local yellow pages, on the radio and through advertisements in trade journals. We primarily conduct our marketing using local trademarks and trade names.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
We seek to differentiate ourselves in areas where we believe we have a competitive advantage, including:
National scale with a strong local presence. Our national scale gives us access to the best products, training and innovation available, while our local teams provide best in class training and installation services and outstanding customer service. Our customers generally select their building products installer based on quality and timeliness of service, knowledge of local building codes, product application expertise, pricing, relationships and reputation in the market. For these reasons, we emphasize the importance of developing and maintaining strong customer relationships at the local level based on the knowledge and experience of our branch management and staff.
Diversified product lines, end markets and geographies. Diversifying our product line offerings provides us opportunity to increase sales to end customers and leverage our branch costs to improve profitability. We continue to generate revenue synergies by taking advantage of cross-selling opportunities with our existing customers in markets where we install multiple products. We have successfully diversified our product offering from the year ended December 31, 2013, when insulation installation comprised approximately 74% of revenues, to the year ended December 31, 2021, where it comprised 64% of revenues. We service the residential new construction and repair and remodel markets, both of which consist of single-family and multi-family dwellings, as well as the commercial construction market. We have diversified our end customer demographic from the year ended December 31, 2013, when revenue from the commercial end market comprised approximately 11% of revenues, to the year ended December 31, 2021 where it comprised 17% of revenues. Our growing exposure to commercial end markets diversifies our customer base and makes our business less dependent on residential new construction. Commercial construction is also driven by longer term projects which tends to provide greater revenue visibility. In periods of declining insulation installation volumes, our sales force is able to leverage our diversity of products and reduce the impact of lost insulation sales by growing sales of complementary building products, further enhancing our ability to perform. Our national geographic footprint provides us a balanced business not concentrated in any single region.
Engaged employees. We offer competitive benefits to our employees to ensure an engaged workforce. In addition to offering certain benefits to most employees, including medical insurance, 401k and paid time off benefits, we also offer longevity stock awards, financial wellness training and savings matching in order to recruit and retain employees. Our retention efforts have reduced our employee turnover to a level below industry averages. Opportunity for professional growth, training and advancement are strongly encouraged. We focus on the well-being of our employees through our Positive Production Program. This micro-video program is designed to help employees thrive in all aspects of life through learning and practicing research-backed physical, intellectual and emotional skills. Engaged, long-tenured employees benefit our business by being highly skilled and efficient, which drives profitability and encourages repeat business and customer loyalty. Higher employee retention also benefits our business through lower recruitment and training expense. We also consider safety and risk management to be a core business objective. Significant staffing, funding and other resources are allocated to our management systems that enhances safety and quality for our employees and our customers. Our branch managers are held accountable for the safety of employees and quality of workmanship at their locations. We provide our employees with ongoing training and development programs necessary to improve safety performance and work quality. Our regional managers, local branch managers and sales force have significant experience in the industry and have spent an average of more than 11 years with our operations. We also created the Installed Building Products Foundation in 2019 as a separate, not-for-profit organization to help support our employees for their education, financial and philanthropic needs.
Financial strength, variable cost structure and strong free cash flow. We believe that we are among the most financially sound companies in our industry. We place an emphasis on having a strong balance sheet which allows us to focus on our strategic initiatives and pursue growth opportunities, drive profitability and generate cash. We have a highly variable cost structure with a significant portion of operating expenses directly linked to volume. Our largest expenses are materials and labor and most of our installation employees are paid by completed job. Our minimal capital expenditure requirements support the generation of strong free cash flow.
Execution excellence. We believe that our ability to consistently complete our installations within a customer’s production schedule is recognized by our customers and is a key component of our high level of service. We have a proven track record of customer satisfaction in managing all aspects of the installation process for our customers. Throughout the construction process, our branch sales and supervisory staff and installation teams make frequent site visits to ensure timely and proper installation and to provide general service support. We believe a high level of service is valued by our customers and generates customer loyalty.
Broad and stable customer base. We benefit from a diverse customer base that includes production and custom homebuilders, multi-family and commercial construction firms, homeowners and residential repair and remodeling contractors. We continue to enhance our long-standing relationships with some of the largest builders in the country. While we serve many national and regional builders across multiple markets, we compete for business at the local level. Given our emphasis on quality service, customer turnover is extremely low.
Well established relationships with suppliers. We have strong long-standing relationships with many of the manufacturers of the materials we use in our business, including the largest manufacturers of fiberglass and spray foam. The fiberglass insulation manufacturing market is highly consolidated and primarily served by four major manufacturers. We buy significant volume from all four manufacturers and have relationships with each company spanning more than two decades. Our national scale allows us to purchase volumes that account for a meaningful portion of the production for these suppliers allowing them to better plan their production schedules. Our relationships and purchasing power often allow us to negotiate preferred material supply terms and to keep purchases through distribution and retail to a minimum, giving us an advantage over our competitors. 
Highly experienced and incentivized management team. Our senior management team (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer) have been directing our strategy on average for over two decades. This team has led us through multiple housing industry cycles, providing valuable continuity and a demonstrated ability to improve operations and grow our business both organically and through acquisitions.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
We believe our geographic footprint, long-standing relationships with national insulation manufacturers, streamlined value chain and proven track record of successful acquisitions provides us with opportunities for continued growth in our existing markets and expansion into new markets. We believe our continued emphasis on expanding our product offering, further expansion into the commercial construction market and other lines of business, and targeting geographies where we look to grow market share will reduce potential future cyclicality of our operations. Our current strategic objectives include:
•capitalize on the new residential and large commercial construction markets;
•continue to strengthen our market share position by working with the best customers. We seek to work with the most profitable and efficient builders and commercial general contractors in our markets;
•recruit, develop and retain an exceptional workforce by investing in our employees and our communities and promoting a family-oriented culture;
•capitalize on our ability to cross-sell products through existing markets as well as new markets entered as a result of organic expansion and acquisitions. In addition to insulation and air infiltration products, we install garage doors, rain gutters, mirrors and shower doors, waterproofing, fireproofing and fire-stopping, window blinds and various other products;
•enhance profitability from our operating leverage and national scale;
•continue expansion in the multibillion-dollar commercial end market. This strategy includes acquiring more locations to serve the large commercial market and increasing overall commercial sales at our existing new residential locations;
•pursue value enhancing acquisitions in markets we currently serve as well as markets that are new to us by continuing our disciplined approach to valuations and pricing. We will continue to be selective in identifying acquisition targets at attractive multiples. We target profitable markets and companies with strong reputations and customer bases. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek to maintain the management teams of the companies we acquire as well as retain their local branding, which further reduces associated risk; and
•we integrate new acquisitions quickly and seamlessly into our corporate infrastructure, including our accounting and employee systems. In addition, we utilize our internal software technology, jobCORE, to integrate most acquired operations and provide in-depth branch-level operational and financial performance data. We realize near term margin enhancement and revenue growth at acquired branches by applying our national buying power and leveraging relationships with large national homebuilders.
One of our key areas of focus has been diversifying our product and service offerings, customer base, and end markets. We have accomplished this through organic growth as well as acquisitions. We believe the benefits of this diversification include:
•Margin enhancement by leveraging branch costs across multiple products
•Diversified end-market exposure
•A more diverse customer base
•Stronger established local relationships
•Reduced cyclicality
Product and end market diversification has been a primary strategic initiative throughout our history. In addition to acquisition and local market share growth, we typically experience an increased rate of product and end market diversification during periods of reduced demand growth rates in the residential end market. As such, our oldest and most established branches tend to exhibit the greatest diversity of service and product offerings. This diversity in turn contributes to enhanced profitability as compared to branches in our newer, less developed markets.
However, we can provide no assurance that the positive trends reflected in our recent financial and operating results will continue in 2022.
TRENDS IN THE MARKETPLACE
Our business relies on various market factors, one of which is residential housing demand. Following the late 2000s recession in the U.S. economy, housing starts dropped well below historical averages. Rates have since returned to early 2000s levels, with 1.6 million non-seasonally adjusted starts in 2021, and another 1.6 million starts forecasted for 2022 according to Wolters Kluwer’s Blue Chip Economic Indicators January 2022 forecast. We expect to benefit from the recent growth in single-family new residential construction. Commercial demand saw the least amount of growth of the end markets we serve due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic ("COVID-19"). However, we expect this sector to recover in 2022 with building starts forecasted to be above pre-pandemic 2019 investment dollars, increasing 12% over 2020 according to Dodge Data & Analytics.
Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of materials, labor and interest rates which in turn can have a negative impact on housing affordability. Inflation in the United States was 7% in 2021, the highest rate since 1982. While mortgage rates were relatively steady throughout most of 2021, rates began to trend upward in December 2021 and have continued that trend in 2022. Additionally, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it plans to begin raising the federal funds rate which in turn will cause mortgage interest rates to rise further. Higher material costs contributed to a lower gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2021, but we are unable to determine how much of the impact was related to inflation due to the supply chain issues that persist. 
COVID-19 IMPACTS
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, the virus has spread globally, including to the United States. In response, the World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic and the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Many public health organizations and international, federal, state and local governments implemented measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 at various times since the beginning of the pandemic. Some of these measures included quarantines, vaccine and/or masking requirements, “stay-at-home” orders and social distancing ordinances and restricting or prohibiting outright some or all forms of commercial and business activity. There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the duration and scope of the pandemic, as well as its continued impact on the economy. We cannot predict if federal, state and local governments will implement additional restrictions, when restrictions currently in place will expire or whether restrictions currently in place will become more limiting.
While the COVID-19 pandemic and related events will likely have a negative effect on us in 2022, the full extent and scope of the impact on our business and industry, as well as national, regional and global markets and economies, depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, additional government actions taken in response to the pandemic, the impact on construction activity and demand for homes (based on employment levels, inflation, consumer spending and consumer confidence). The fast recovery in residential housing demand helped offset prolonged impacts of the pandemic already experienced. In the commercial sector, we have experienced delays in the onset of certain large-scale infrastructure programs due to declining need for such structures and/or project funding declines. Commercial spending rose in 2021, but remains below 2019 levels. Commercial projects could decline in the future if consumer behaviors change in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions to the economy and changes to our general ways of life. For example, reduced demand for office buildings and/or educational facilities, decreased airport traffic, or decreased usage of sports arenas or similar commercial structures could continue to impact our commercial end market. 
Our management remains focused on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our business and the risk to our employees and customers. We have taken a number of precautionary measures intended to mitigate these risks. We follow all masking requirements imposed by authorities, most of which have had no adverse effects on our business since wearing protective equipment in the process of completing our installation work is already a common practice in our industry. We have also taken advantage of available technologies which allow some employees the ability to work remotely from home. We comply with regulations from federal, state and local government agencies. Certain protocols have evolved throughout 2021 as vaccines have become available and guidelines from public health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control are updated. We are prepared to take additional actions if necessary as suggested or required by various health agencies. 
We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have experienced limited business disruptions to date and therefore have not needed to implement significant continuity measures and have not incurred significant related expenditures. Assuming a large number of 
additional states or markets in which we operate do not reverse their current positions about construction being an “essential” business, we do not anticipate having to implement any additional measures in the future.
Our corporate office has been fully operational throughout the pandemic. As such, we have made no modifications to internal controls over financial reporting and have confidence controls are operating as designed. We have enhanced our efforts to mitigate cyber threats and phishing, given some employees are still working remotely. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact of their design and operating effectiveness.
We expect some impact from the pandemic to our earnings, financial position and cash flows to continue in 2022, however there is much uncertainty surrounding the estimated magnitude of these impacts. We estimate limited impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheets other than a potential reduction in working capital due to the possibility of reduced net revenue and net income. Trade accounts receivable may also be reduced somewhat by lower net revenue and a higher allowance for credit losses due to enhanced risk of collectibility from some customers, although we have not seen a significant impact to date. We anticipate revenue and net income may continue to be negatively impacted into 2022 due to supply constraints and/or material price increases ultimately stemming from the effects of the pandemic, as well as other factors such as high demand for housing. While our cash from operations may decline over recent performance due to a decrease in expected net income driven by lower net revenue, we do not anticipate any issues meeting debt obligations or making timely payments to vendors given our strong liquidity and large cash reserves. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for further information. Given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effects, it is not possible to estimate the full, adverse impact to our future 2022 sales or other financial results at this time.
SAFETY AND QUALITY CONTROL 
Our quality control process starts with the initial proposal. Our sales staff and managers are knowledgeable about our service offerings and scope of work. They are trained on manufacturers’ guidelines as well as state and local building codes. Our quality control programs emphasize onsite inspections, training by manufacturers and various certification programs.
We consider safety and risk management to be a core business objective and require our installers to wear personal protective equipment in the process of completing their work. Each year, we allocate significant staffing, funding and resources to our management systems that directly impact safety. We have strong workplace safety measures, including Safety Wanted 365, an initiative focused on creating a safer working environment to reduce job site injuries for both our employees and other jobsite personnel through year-round education and training. Additionally, our branch managers are held accountable for the safety of employees and quality of workmanship at their locations.
We track all incidents that occur on our job sites that could result in injury, including minor incidents that may not require first aid or medical treatment. We use this incident information to continually refine and develop our safety training programs for new hires and the continual training and safety knowledge throughout employment at IBP. We believe these programs are having a benefit on the safety and physical well-being of our employees. Although total hours worked increased 11% from 2019 to 2021, OSHA-defined incidents increased by only 4% during the same period, resulting in a decline in incident rate per hours worked of 6%. We also reported a 15% drop in severe incidents and OSHA reportable incidents from 2019 to 2021, had only 11 severe incidents in 2021 and the incident per hour worked dropped 23%. We had zero fatalities in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and are continually finding ways to improve our practices throughout the organization in order to improve the health and safety of our workforce.
CUSTOMERS
We serve a broad group of national, regional and local homebuilders, multi-family and commercial construction firms, individual homeowners and repair and remodeling contractors. Our top ten customers, which are primarily a combination of national and regional builders, accounted for approximately 15% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. We install a variety of products in multiple markets for our largest customers, further diversifying our relationship with them. For example, our largest customer is independently serviced by 70 different IBP branches nationwide despite representing approximately 5% of net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. While our largest customers are homebuilders, our customer base is also diverse. We work on a range of commercial projects including office buildings, airports, sports complexes, museums, hospitals, hotels and educational facilities. Of our top 20 customers, 17 represent homebuilders and the remaining three represent commercial customers. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers and have served each of our top ten customers for more than a decade.
BACKLOG
For contracts that are not complete at the reporting date, we recognize revenue over time utilizing a cost-to-cost input method. When this method is used, we estimate the costs to complete individual contracts and record as revenue that portion of the total contract price that is considered complete based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to total anticipated costs. The costs of earned revenue include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools and repairs. Backlog represents the transaction price for contracts for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential modifications. Backlog is not a guarantee of future revenues as contractual commitments may change. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenues within the expected timeframe, if at all. We estimate backlog was $143.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and we estimated it to be $78.5 million as of December 31, 2020.
SUPPLIERS
We have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, and we purchase from manufacturers whenever possible to streamline the typical supply chain. As one of the largest purchasers of insulation in the United States, we believe that we maintain particularly strong relationships with the largest manufacturers of the products we use in our business. The proximity of certain of our branch locations to insulation manufacturers’ facilities provides additional mutual benefits, including opportunities for cost savings and joint planning regarding future production. Due to the limited number of large fiberglass insulation manufacturers, our three largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 33% of all material purchases for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also believe that we maintain good relationships with suppliers of the non-insulation products we install. We have found that using multiple suppliers ensures a stable source of materials and favorable purchasing terms as suppliers compete to gain and maintain our business. In addition, our national purchasing volumes provide leverage with suppliers as we pursue additional purchasing synergies. The industry is currently experiencing manufacturer supply constraints for some of the materials we purchase due to an unanticipated increase in demand as well as global supply chain bottlenecks caused by manufacturing curtailments due to COVID-19. See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, "Key Factors Affecting our Operating Results" for more information.
SEASONALITY
We typically have higher sales during the second half of the year as our homebuilder customers complete construction of homes placed under contract for sale in the traditionally stronger spring selling season. In addition, some of our larger branches operate in states impacted by winter weather and, as such, experience a slowdown in construction activity during the first quarter of the calendar year. This winter slowdown contributes to traditionally lower sales and profitability in our first quarter. As a result of the aforementioned material supply constraints, some jobs may be temporarily delayed, resulting in lower revenue in the first and/or second quarters of 2022 than we would normally expect. While we anticipate this will not have a significant effect on our business, we cannot predict the full impact on our results of operations at this time.
The composition and level of our working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables, although these changes are generally offset in part by higher trade payables to our suppliers. Working capital levels increase in the summer and fall seasons due to higher sales during the peak of residential construction activity. Typically, the subsequent collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels during the winter months has positively impacted cash flow. In the past, we have from time to time utilized our borrowing availability under our credit facilities to cover short-term working capital needs.
COMPETITION
We believe that competition in our industry is based on quality and timeliness of service, knowledge of local building codes, pricing, relationships and reputation in the market. The building products installation industry is highly fragmented. The markets for our non-insulation installation services are even more fragmented than the markets for insulation installation services. Our competitors include one other large national contractor, several large regional contractors and numerous local contractors. We expect to continue to effectively compete in our local markets given our long-standing customer relationships, access to capital, tenure and quality of local staff, quality installation reputation and competitive pricing.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,500 employees, consisting of approximately 6,700 installers, approximately 700 sales professionals, approximately 600 production personnel and approximately 1,500 administrative and management personnel. Less than 4% of our employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage or strike, and we believe that we have good relationships with our employees. 
Our employees are critical to our continued success and are our most important resource. We focus on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. We consider retaining skilled employees to be a competitive advantage and employ various strategies to improve turnover metrics. In addition, we offer many benefits and resources to most employees, some of which are above and beyond what others in our industry offer. See "Competitive Advantages, Engaged employees” above for further details on turnover metrics and the benefits we offer. 
Our management team supports the development of our existing workforce by establishing a culture of employee engagement, employee appreciation and the opportunity for promotion from within for many leadership positions. We believe this provides increased retention and promotes a long-term focus to our operations.
We respect and support the diversity of all people within our workforce. We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") practices and maintaining workplaces free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, age, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, gender, sexual orientation, gender identification, disability, military status, veteran status, or any other status protected by law. We are proud of our strong and diverse workforce. Our Hispanic/Latino diversity outpaces the construction industry average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and our workforce as a whole is comprised of over 50% ethnic minorities. In addition, based on gender, racial, ethnic and orientation diversity, 50% of our board of directors is diverse, which helps drive our strategies for an inclusive workplace. We are committed in policy and practice to providing equal employment opportunities for all applicants and employees based upon their training, experience, and overall qualifications. Employees across all our branches are invited to participate in our regional and national DE&I committees to determine the standards for how employees should interact with one another and their communities. We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior or harassment. 
The health and safety of our employees is of primary importance. See “Safety and Quality Control” above for details on our policies and practices. Our policy is designed to protect against accidents, injuries, and illnesses, in compliance with applicable safety and health laws and regulations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented enhanced safety protocols to protect our employees’ health and well-being, and to comply with regulations from federal, state and local government agencies. Certain protocols evolved throughout 2021 as vaccines became available and guidelines from public health authorities such as the Centers for Disease Control were updated. See “COVID-19 Impacts” above for more information.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
JobCORE is our web-enabled internal software technology used by the majority of our branches. The system is designed to operate our business in a highly efficient manner and manage our operations. The jobCORE software provides in-depth real-time job-level operational and financial performance data from each branch to the corporate office. JobCORE provides us, our branch managers and our sales personnel with an important operational tool for monitoring branch level performance. It assists management in assessing important business questions, including customer analysis, sales staff analysis, branch analysis and other operating activities.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We possess intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade names and know-how and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. In particular, we maintain registered trademarks and trade names, some of which are the trademarks and trade names under which many of our local branches operate and we own or have licensed rights to use jobCORE and other software used in the operation of our business. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any one of our trademarks or trade names, we believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to the development and conduct of our business as well as to the local marketing of our services. We also maintain domain name registrations for each of our local branch websites. We make efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, although the actions we take may be inadequate to prevent others from using similar intellectual property. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our use of intellectual property and we may be unable to successfully resolve such claims.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS
As part of our commitment to socially responsible corporate practices, we expanded our Environmental, Social, and Governance ("ESG") efforts by releasing our inaugural ESG report in 2021. This ESG report outlines our sustainability targets and objectives and can be found on our corporate website at https://installedbuildingproducts.com/sustainability. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in, or otherwise made a part of, this Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Insulation is a critical component in reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Energy, or DOE, states that over half of the energy used in the average American home is for heating and cooling due to many homes not having proper insulation. Per an insulation fact sheet provided by the DOE, inadequate insulation and air leakage are leading causes of energy waste in most homes. Through insulating homes and commercial structures, our industry promotes energy efficiency. Our loose-fill cellulose insulation is manufactured from recycled waste paper and our fiberglass insulation is made from recycled glass which helps reuse resources and reduce our global carbon footprint.
We are committed to socially responsible corporate practices. Through the Installed Building Products Foundation and other volunteer opportunities, we give back to the communities we serve. We also provide longevity stock awards and financial wellness training to our employees. We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations.
We are responsible for adhering to several federal, state and local regulations covering building codes, compliance with COVID-19 restrictions, labor-related regulations covering minimum wage and employee safety, and transportation procedures. Our transportation operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, which has broad administrative powers. We are also subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the DOT. In addition, vehicle dimension and weight and driver hours of service are subject to both federal and state regulation. Our operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, which has broad administrative powers regarding workplace and jobsite safety.
Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, release, discharge and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, substances, waste and petroleum products and the investigation, remediation, removal and monitoring of the presence or release of such materials, substances, waste and petroleum products, including at currently or formerly owned or occupied premises and off-site disposal locations. We have not previously incurred material costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we could be subject to material costs, liabilities or claims relating to environmental compliance in the future, especially in the event of changes in existing laws and regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement.
As the nature of our business involves the use or handling of certain potentially hazardous or toxic substances, including spray foam applications and lead-based paint, we may be held liable for claims alleging injury or damage resulting from the release of or exposure to such substances, as well as claims relating to the presence of mold, fungal growth and moisture intrusion alleged in connection with our business activities. In addition, as owners and lessees of real property, we may be held liable for, among other things, releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products on, at, under or emanating from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, or any off-site disposal locations, or for any known or newly discovered environmental conditions at or relating to any of our properties, including those arising from activities conducted by previous occupants or at adjoining properties, without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for such release. We may be required to investigate, remove, remediate or monitor the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products and may be held liable by a governmental entity for fines and penalties or to any third parties for damages, including for bodily injury, property damage and natural resource damage in connection with the presence or release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products.
To date, costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to pollution or the protection of human health and safety, the environment and natural resources have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results, and we do not anticipate incurring material expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations in the current fiscal year.
In conjunction with our lease agreements and other transactions, we often provide reasonable and customary indemnities relating to various matters, including environmental issues. To date, we have not had to pay a material amount pursuant to any such indemnification obligations.
In addition, our suppliers are subject to various laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations. With our purchase of a cellulose manufacturer in November 2018, we are subject to similar laws and regulations that apply to our suppliers.
