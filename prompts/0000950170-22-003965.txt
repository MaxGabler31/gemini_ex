Item 1. Business
Overview
    Celsius is a fast-growing company in the functional energy drink and liquid supplement categories in the United States and internationally. We engage in the development, processing, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional drinks and liquid supplements to a broad range of consumers. We believe that we provide differentiated products that offer clinically proven and innovative formulas meant to change the lives of our consumers for the better. We also believe that our brand is attractive to a broad range of customers including fitness enthusiasts.
    Our core offerings include pre- and post-workout functional energy drinks, as well as protein bars. Our flagship functional energy drink and liquid supplement brands are backed by science, being clinically proven to deliver health benefits by six self-funded studies published in various journals including the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, and the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. These studies have concluded that a single serving of CELSIUS® burns 100-140 calories (by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12%, while providing sustained energy for up to three hours.
    Our flagship asset, CELSIUS®, is a fitness supplement drink which accelerates metabolism and burns calories and body fat while providing energy. This product line comes in two versions, a ready-to-drink supplement format and an on-the-go powder form. We also offer a CELSIUS HEAT and a BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS line, catered to both pre- and post-workout consumer needs. Our products are currently offered in major retail channels in the US including conventional grocery, natural, convenience, fitness, mass market, vitamin specialty and e-commerce.
    An integral part of our value proposition is our focus on the functional energy drink and liquid supplement category, ensuring our products have clear and proven benefits. This is why we invest in research and development from the start and utilize our proprietary MetaPlus® formulation in our portfolio, a blend of ginger root, guarana seed extract, chromium, vitamins, and green tea extract.
    Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business
    The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following:
 
•We have experienced some decreases in sales of our products in various distribution channels that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as health and fitness clubs. While some of the restrictions imposed as a result of the initial COVID-19 outbreak have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized, resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in some markets has slowed or reversed the reopening process, and markets are moving through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times. However, we have recently seen a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Northern Hemisphere while cases in the Southern Hemisphere continue to rise. As a result, a number of countries, particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, reinstituted lockdowns and other restrictions, which could further impact customer demand. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches, could be prolonged and may become more severe.
 •Deteriorating economic conditions and continued financial uncertainties in many of our major markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased and prolonged unemployment, decreases in per capita income and the level of disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, public concern among consumers regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 may also reduce demand for our products.
 •The closures of, and continued restrictions on, on-premise retailers and other establishments that sell our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our sales and results of operations.
 •Our advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement activities have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by reduced opportunities for such activities due to measures taken to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellations of or reduced capacity at sporting events, concerts and other events may result in decreased demand for our products. Our product sampling programs, which are part of our strategy to develop brand awareness, have been, and will continue to be, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the changing landscape of advertising, marketing, promotional, sponsorship and endorsement opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our sales, market share, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.
 •Our innovation activities, including our ability to introduce new products in certain markets, have been delayed and/or adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If such innovation activities are disrupted and we continue to delay the launch of new products and/or we are unable to secure sufficient distribution levels for such new products, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 •Some of our suppliers, bottlers/distributors and co-packers may experience plant closures, production slowdowns and disruptions in operations as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This could result in a disruption to our operations.


•We may experience delays in receiving certain raw materials as a result of shipping delays due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed by port authorities, closures of, or congestion at ports, reduced availability of commercial transportation, border restrictions and capacity constraints.
 •Due to increased demand in at-home consumption, the functional energy drink and liquid supplement industries have experienced some shortages of aluminum cans. However, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects on our business, operations and financial condition from such shortage, however we are unable to accurately predict how this might change.
 •As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental measures, restrictions, directives and guidance, many of our office-based employees have worked remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our remote work policy remains in place. If our employees working remotely do not maintain appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and operations from information technology-related disruptions, we may face cybersecurity threats. Employees of our third-party service providers who are working remotely, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar cybersecurity risks.
 •Governmental authorities at the U.S. federal, state and/or municipal level and in certain foreign jurisdictions may increase or impose new income taxes, indirect taxes or other taxes or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations as a means of financing the costs of stimulus or may take other measures to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in direct and indirect tax rates could affect our net income and increases in consumer taxes could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales.
 •We may be required to record significant impairment charges with respect to goodwill or intangible assets whose fair values may be negatively affected by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 •The continued financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause one or more of the financial institutions we do business with to fail or default in their obligations to us or to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, which could cause us to incur significant losses and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 •Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in negative publicity and the Company becoming a party to litigation claims and/or legal proceedings, which could consume significant financial and managerial resources, result in decreased demand for our products and injury to our reputation.
 •The resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic’s lingering effects on our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers, contractors, business partners and/or other service providers.
 
Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition.
 
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in April 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 2424 North Federal Highway, Suite 208, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, and our telephone number is (561) 276-2239. Our website is www.celsiusholdingsinc.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report.
Our Products
    CELSIUS® calorie-burning functional energy drinks were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005.
    According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of CELSIUS® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise.
    We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. CELSIUS® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. CELSIUS® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. CELSIUS® is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda®, which makes our functional energy drinks low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of CELSIUS® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse.
    We currently have five functional energy drink lines:
 •CELSIUS® Originals, our initial product line is currently offered in various flavors which are carbonated and non-carbonated.
 •CELSIUS HEAT, introduced in 2018 is a trainer’s grade functional energy drink. CELSIUS HEAT is also a dietary supplement that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus® formula as CELSIUS®, Originals, which is proven to accelerate metabolism, boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. CELSIUS HEAT, which is packed with 2,000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine, comes in eight carbonated flavors: Apple Jack’d, Orangesicle, Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime, Blueberry Pomegranate, Strawberry Dragonfruit, Tangerine Grapefruit and Jackfruit.


•CELSIUS® BCCA+ENERGY, introduced in 2019, is an innovative branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) functional energy drink that fuels muscle recovery. The CELSIUS® BCCA+ENERGY product line was initially launched in the fitness channel.
 •CELSIUS® On-the-Go is a powdered form of the active ingredients in our functional energy drinks in individual On-The-Go packets as well as multiple serving canisters.
 •CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia is a natural line extension introduced in 2018, targeting the natural products channel. CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia is available in six refreshing flavors: three sparkling - grapefruit, cucumber lime, orange pomegranate and three non-carbonated - pineapple coconut, watermelon berry and strawberries & cream. This product line boasts a clean ingredient panel featuring 100% natural caffeine-from-green-coffee bean extract and Stevia an all-natural sweetener.
    CELSIUS® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold in various packaging units. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink products line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free.
    As a result of completion of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market and in the US. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries.

Clinical Studies
 
It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more functional energy drinks and other beverages are marketed with health claims. CELSIUS® was one of the first functional energy drinks to be launched along with a clinical study. CELSIUS® is also one of very few functional energy drinks that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some functional energy drink and supplement companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product.
    We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for CELSIUS®. Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total CELSIUS® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided CELSIUS® functional energy drinks for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies.
    The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of CELSIUS® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of CELSIUS® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke®. All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank CELSIUS® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis.
    Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy.
 
The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of CELSIUS® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming CELSIUS® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo drink and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant.
 
The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the CELSIUS® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis.
 
Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined CELSIUS® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of CELSIUS® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo

beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion.
 
Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels.
 
Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS®, per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO2 were observed in the subjects that consumed CELSIUS® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects.
 
Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as its ready to drink products.
 
Manufacture and Supply of Our Products
 
Our functional energy drinks and supplements are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of CELSIUS® products is specified as 15 to 18 months.
    Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in CELSIUS® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. CELSIUS® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules.
    Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages.
    We believe that our co-packing arrangements and supply sources are adequate for our present needs.
    Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries.
    Distribution
    Domestic
    In the United States and elsewhere in North America, CELSIUS® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites.
 
We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR).
    We are continuing to emphasize the expansion of our DSD distribution network as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales.
      
Our products are sold online through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As a result of the shift to online purchasing by consumers, including additional growth arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the shutdown of various retail outlets, particularly gyms and health clubs in the fitness channel, e-commerce sales have accounted for a growing percentage of our domestic revenue.
   International
   We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. CELSIUS® intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe.
    We market our products in the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, through local distributors in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the CELSIUS® brand in 2018 through our partnership in Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our CELSIUS® products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize CELSIUS® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $7.0 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by CELSIUS® into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated.
Customer Concentration
    For the year ended December 31, 2021, Costco and Amazon accounted for approximately 12.7% and 10.1% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, those customers accounted for approximately 2.9% and 15.1% of our revenues, respectively. Additionally, Amazon and Publix accounted for approximately 22.7% and 10.3% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and approximately11.3% and 6.0% of our accounts receivable. as of December 31, 2020.
Seasonality of Sales
    As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, sales of our products are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets.
Competition
    We believe that our CELSIUS® brand products are one of the few calorie-burning functional energy drink and supplement lines whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the functional energy drink and supplement markets. However, our products do compete broadly with not only functional energy drinks and supplements, but all categories of liquid refreshments. The functional energy drink, supplement and liquid refreshment markets are highly competitive, and include international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional energy drink and supplement markets include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull.
Proprietary Rights
    We have registered the CELSIUS® and MetaPlus® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks.
    We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas.
 
We maintain our MetaPlus® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula.
    We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future.
    As a result of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we have acquired additional brands and tradenames.
    Government Regulation
    The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an

important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products.
 
Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.
    Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
    The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold.
