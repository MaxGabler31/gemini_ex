ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BUSINESS
 
Incorporated on March 24, 1982, SORL Auto Parts, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. Through its 90% ownership of the Ruili Group Ruian Auto Parts Co., Ltd., a Sino-Foreign joint venture (the “Joint Venture”), SORL Auto Parts, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” or “SORL”) develops, manufactures and distributes automotive brake systems and other key safety related auto parts to automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and the related aftermarket both in China and abroad. The Company’s products are used in different types of commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses. Automotive brake systems and other key safety related auto parts are critical components that ensure driving safety.
 
The Joint Venture was formed in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) as a Sino-Foreign joint venture on January 17, 2004, pursuant to the terms of a Joint Venture Agreement (the “JV Agreement”) between the Ruili Group Co., Ltd. (the “Ruili Group”) and Fairford Holdings Limited (“Fairford”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Ruili Group was incorporated in China in 1987 and specialized in the development, production and sale of various kinds of automotive parts. Fairford and the Ruili Group contributed 90% and 10%, respectively, of the paid-in capital of the Joint Venture, which totaled $7.1 million.
 
On January 19, 2004 the Joint Venture acquired the business segment of the Ruili Group relating to manufacture and sale of various kinds of valves for automotive brake systems and related operations (the “Transferred Business”). The Ruili Group began its automotive air brake valve business in 1987. The acquisition was accomplished by a transfer from the Ruili Group to Fairford of relevant assets and liabilities of the Transferred Business including trade receivables, inventories and machineries, and the assumption of short and long term borrowings for a purchase price of $6,390,000. The consideration was based on a valuation provided by Ruian Ruiyang Assets Valuation Co., Ltd., an independent PRC valuation firm. Fairford then transferred these assets and liabilities to the Joint Venture as consideration for its 90% ownership interest of the Joint Venture. The Ruili Group transferred inventory as its capital contribution for its 10% interest in the Joint Venture. The assets and liabilities transferred to the Joint Venture by Fairford and the Ruili Group represented all the assets and liabilities of the Transferred Business. Certain historical information of the Transferred Business is based on the operation of the Transferred Business when it was owned by the Ruili Group.
 
On November 30, 2006, the Company completed a follow-on public offering of 4,285,714 shares of common stock at $7.25 per share. Gross proceeds were approximately $31.1 million. Net proceeds after approximately $2.2 million of underwriters’ commissions and approximately $0.7 million of related offering expenses were approximately $28.2 million. On December 13, 2006, Maxim Group LLC, the lead underwriter of offering, exercised its over-allotment option in full to purchase an additional 642,857 shares of common stock. After deduction of underwriter’s discount of approximately $0.3 million, the Company received approximately $4.3 million. The aggregate net proceeds to the Company of this offering were approximately $32.5 million, which included the approximate $4.3 million as a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriters.
 
On December 8 and 26, 2006, pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, as revised, through Fairford, the Company invested $32.67 million in its operating subsidiary, the Joint Venture. To maintain its 10% interest in the Joint Venture, the Ruili Group increased its capital investment by $3.63 million. Accordingly, the Company continued to hold a 90% controlling interest in the operating subsidiary. Pursuant to the JV Agreement and the Joint Venture Agreement, as revised, the total paid-in capital of the Joint Venture increased from $7.1 million to $43.4 million.

On November 11, 2009, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Fairford, entered into a joint venture agreement with MGR, a Hong Kong-based global auto parts distribution specialty firm and an unaffiliated Taiwanese individual investor. The new joint venture was named SORL International Holding, Ltd. (“SIH”) based in Hong Kong. Fairford holds a 60% interest in SIH, MGR holds a 30% interest, and the Taiwanese individual investor holds a 10% interest. SIH is primarily devoted to expanding SORL’s international sales network in the Asia-Pacific region and creating a larger footprint in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a target to create a truly global distribution network. In December 2015, due to poor financial performance of SIH, Fairfold sold all of its interest in SIH to the Taiwanese individual investor for US$77 (HK$600), and the share transfer was approved by the Hong Kong authorities on January 14, 2016. After this transaction, SIH ceased to be a distributor of SORL in the international market.
 
On February 8, 2010, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to selected institutional investors at a price of $10.00 per share pursuant to a registered direct offering. This transaction provided net proceeds of approximately $9.4 million. On March 9, 2010, through Fairford, SORL invested approximately $9.4 million in its operating subsidiary, the Joint Venture. To maintain its 10% interest in the Joint Venture, the Ruili Group increased its capital investment by approximately $1.0 million. Accordingly, SORL continues to hold a 90% controlling interest in the operating subsidiary. The total paid-in capital of the Joint Venture increased from $43.4 million to $53.8 million.
 
On August 31, 2010, the Company, through the Joint Venture, executed an Agreement to acquire the assets of the hydraulic brake, power steering, and automotive electrical operations of the Ruili Group, a related party under common control. As a result of this acquisition, the Company’s product offerings expanded to both commercial and passenger vehicles’ brake systems and other key safety-related auto parts. The purchase price was RMB170 million, or approximately $25 million. The transaction was accounted for using the book basis of assets acquired, consisting primarily of machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and patent rights, used or usable in connection with the acquired segment of the auto parts business of the Ruili Group. The Company purchased the machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable at book values of $8.0 million, $8.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively. The Company did not acquire any of the assets of the Ruili Group other than as described above. The excess of consideration over the carrying value of net assets received has been recorded as a decrease in the additional paid-in capital of the Company.
 
The Company accounted for the acquisition as a transaction between the entities under common control because Mr. Xiao Ping Zhang, the Chairman and CEO of the Company owns 63% of the registered capital of the Ruili Group, and, together with his wife (Ms. Shu Ping Chi) and brother (Mr. Xiao Feng Zhang), owns approximately 58.8% of the outstanding common stock of SORL. As a result, the Company accounted for the acquisition using the historical costs of the financial statements of the Ruili Group. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the acquisition took place at the earliest time presented, that is, as of January 1, 2009. The asset purchase was deemed to be the acquisition of a business.
 
On October 30, 2015, Mr. Xiao Ping Zhang, the Chairman and CEO of the Company, together with his wife (Ms. Shu Ping Chi) and brother (Mr. Xiao Feng Zhang) (collectively, the “Consortium”) submitted a non-binding proposal (the “Proposal”) to the board of directors of the Company proposing to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock not already owned by the Consortium at a price of $2.84 per share in cash and if successful in that acquisition, to cause the Company’s common stock to be delisted from NASDAQ and to be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The board of directors subsequently formed a special committee (the “Special Committee”) consisting of independent directors to evaluate the Proposal. On January 8, 2016, the Consortium sent a letter to the Special Committee withdrawing the Proposal citing concerns over recent market conditions.
 
On May 5, 2016, through its principal operating subsidiary, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the Ruili Group, a related party under common control, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase the land use rights and factory facilities located at No. 2666 Kaifaqu Avenue, Rui’an Economic Development Zone, Rui’an City, Zhejiang Province, the People’s Republic of China (the “Development Zone Facility”). In exchange for the Development Zone Facility, the Company agreed to transfer to the Ruili Group the land use rights and factory facilities of the Dongshan Facility owned by the company, plus RMB501,000,000 (approximately $76,533,000) in cash.

The cash consideration in the amount of RMB481,000,000 (approximately $73,478,000) was paid to the Ruili Group in installments before June 30, 2016, and the remaining RMB20,000,000 (approximately $3,016,000) will be paid within 10 days of completion of the required procedures for transferring the title of the facilities and the land use right as specified in the Purchase Agreement. Before the transaction, the Company was leasing 89,229 square meters of the Development Zone Facility from Ruili Group for its brake systems business, which lease was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2017. This lease was terminated upon the completion of the purchase. The transaction was approved by a committee of independent directors of the Company based on the valuation reports of a real estate appraisal firm.
 
STRATEGIC PLAN
 
With the implementation of the Chinese IV Emission Standard, large quantities of used vehicles could not reach the standard requirements and were determined to be replaced, which contributed to substantial increase in auto parts sales for 2018. Additionally, in 2018, the Chinese government strictly enforced the rule that vehicles must not be overloaded above weight limits, which resulted in higher demands in new vehicles that are capable of loading larger weight limits. The higher demands lead to increased sales in auto parts. In 2019, the Company expects the aforementioned law enforcements of emission standards and weight limits will continue to boost the needs in auto parts until demands of new vehicles are saturated. In 2019, the Chinese Central Government will still strengthen the actions to control the excess emission of the diesel vehicle and also include the New Energy Vehicle development as one of its essential works. Based on the above analysis, the management projects the commercial vehicle market will have a slight increase in 2019. In 2019, our strategic plan includes these elements:

● | Enhance the development of new energy products. The management projects that the New Energy Vehicle market will have a moderate growth in 2019. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improve manufacturing technology and further computerize our manufacturing processes. We plan to continue improving our manufacturing process to enhance product quality. We believe that improvement of manufacturing technology will further automate and streamline our manufacturing processes, which could ultimately eliminate human errors, increase manufacturing efficiency, lower production costs and at the same time ensure consistent quality of our products. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The annual reviews for other certifications which we passed include ISO14001 on environmental management and OHSAS18001 for health and safety management, reflecting the Company’s commitment to workplace safety, health and environmental protection.
 
CHINA AUTOMOBILE AND AUTO PARTS INDUSTRY
 
Based on statistics published by the China Association of Automobile Manufactures (“CAAM”) in 2018, China currently is still the world’s biggest automotive market and continued to expand, 2018 is lower than 2017. The automobile industry is one of China’s key industries, contributing significantly to the growth of China’s economy.
 
According to the statistics published by the CAAM in 2018, China’s automobile output and sales volume were 27.81 million units and 28.08 million units, respectively, representing decreases of 4.16% and 2.76% respectively comparing to 2018. The output and sales volume of commercial vehicles increased by 1.69% to 4.28 million units and 5.05% to 4.37 million units, respectively.
 
The Chinese auto parts industry is highly fragmented. Management believes that the future development areas of China’s auto parts industry will likely include:
 

● | To keep pace with the rapid development of new automobile technologies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | To meet the requirements of increasingly demanding OEM customers, such as zero defects, and cost reduction. 
● | To partner with OEM customers in the entire process from product design, development and production to cost control, quality control and final delivery. 
● | To restructure the industry and form large auto parts manufacturing groups which will enhance the overall competitiveness of Chinese auto parts manufacturers when competing with leading international manufacturers. 

MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS
 
We strengthened our sales and marketing efforts in 2018. The sales person headcounts for Chinese sales and international sales were 149 and 73, respectively. Products are sold under the “SORL” trademark, which we licensed on a royalty free basis from Ruili Group. The Company renewed the license from Ruili Group in 2012 which currently expires in 2022. We have an agreement with Ruili Group that the term of the license will be extended beyond 2022 as long as the registration for the trademark is renewed.
 
In general, The Company’s sales can be divided into three segments: Chinese OEM Market, Chinese Aftermarket, and International Market. The above identified markets account for approximately 50.5%, 31.4% and 18.1%, respectively, of the Company’s annual sales for 2018.
 
Chinese OEM Market - We have established long-term business relationships with most of the major vehicle manufacturers in China. We sell our products to approximately 70 major vehicle manufacturers, including a majority of the key truck manufacturers in China. In addition to heavy-duty trucks, our products are also widely used in brake systems on buses. Typically, bus manufacturers purchase a chassis from truck chassis manufacturers which already has incorporated our brake systems.

COMPETITION
 
We conduct our business in a complex and highly competitive industry. The global automotive parts industry principally involves the supply of systems, modules and components to vehicle manufacturers for the manufacture of new vehicles. Additionally, suppliers provide parts to other suppliers for use in the latter’s product offerings and to the aftermarket for use as replacement or enhancement parts for older vehicles. Currently, vehicle manufacturers generally only engage in assembling but not manufacturing non-key automotive parts. Rather, they source these parts through a global network of suppliers. As a result, only those automotive parts manufacturers with large-scale production capacity, advanced technology and the ability to produce system and modules can supply their products to vehicle manufacturers directly. The automotive parts industry in China is fragmented and there are many small manufacturers who mainly target at the aftermarket. However, there are not many companies which have established both nationwide aftermarket sales networks and close relationships with leading OEM manufacturers. As the largest commercial vehicle air brake system manufacturer (by sales volume) in China, we have established long-term business relationships with many major automotive manufacturers in China, such as FAW Group (a.k.a. First Auto Group), Dongfeng Motors Group, Beiqi Foton Motor Co., Ltd., Baotou North-Benz Heavy Duty Truck Co., Ltd. and Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. The management believes that the keys for being a successful commercial vehicle air brake supplier are product quality, price competitiveness, development capability, new product development capacity, and timely delivery. We have strived to improve our competitiveness by recruiting highly qualified managers and employees, improving our product design capability and facilities, and providing better customer services.
 
Domestic Competition - Our major competitors in China are: VIE and CAFF, each as described below.
 

China VIE Group, or VIE: Its principal products are main valves and unloader/governors, majorly supplied to OEMs, such as Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd., and the remaining portion supplied to the aftermarket and export. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Chongqing CAFF Automobile Braking and Steering Systems Co., Ltd., or CAFF: Its main products are air dryers and main valves. Its principal customer is Chongqing Heavy Vehicle Group Co., Ltd. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the Company has the following competitive advantages:
 

● | Brand Name: As one of China’s largest (by sales volume) commercial vehicle air brake systems manufacturer, our “SORL” brand is known nationwide. SORL was awarded as the “Well-Known Brand” issued by Chinese State Administration of Industry and Commerce. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Technology: We take technological innovation and leadership as the critical path to enhance our core competence. Our technology center includes a laboratory specializing in the research of automotive brake controlling technologies and development of air brake system products. We have also established a new state-of-the-art testing center in 2014, which strengthened our testing capability. 
● | Product Development: Because our management has the belief that our products ultimately define our success, we continue to increase our budget for research and development activities. Through our international sales offices in the US, the Middle East and Europe we are able to promptly collect information about current trends in automotive technologies, which in turn is applied to our new product development and used to enhance our ability to provide domestic OEMs with advanced products. In addition, our software systems and strict implementation of ISO/TS16949 standards in the development process greatly shorten our development lead time and improve new product quality. The Company has developed its own independent intellectual property embedded in its air brake spring chambers. The spring chamber’s structure, performance, and quality have made it one of the Company’s key products and it enjoys a great deal of success among domestic auto manufacturers. 
● | China Sales Networks: We have 56 authorized distributors covering seven regions in China. We help train their salesperson and improve their service quality. These authorized distributors in turn distribute “SORL” products through over 2,000 sub-distributors throughout China. 

 
International Competition - In the international market, our largest competitors are Wabco Holdings, Inc. and Knorr-Bremse Group. While management believes our current advantage over Wabco Holdings, Inc. and Knorr-Bremse Group is our lower pricing, management also believes that the Company’s product quality and brand awareness are improving. Our competitive advantages over other competitors in the global market are:
 

● | Performance-Cost Ratio: Our products enjoy lower production costs due to the low labor costs in China. The Company’s technology and manufacturing improvements have strengthened and our products’ performance-cost ratio is increasing. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quick Adaptation to Local Markets: Through our international sales channels in the U.S., the Middle East and Europe, we have been able to timely respond to local market needs. 
● | Diversified Auto Products: In addition to braking system products for commercial vehicles, we also produce key safety products for passenger vehicles and braking system products for railway vehicles. This integrated product offering helps reduce customers’ transaction costs and incentives the customers to purchase such products from us. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND INNOVATION CAPACITY
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 556 technical staff members, 235 of whom possess Engineer or Senior Engineer qualifications. Our technical staff are divided as follows: 39 for information technology, 316 for new product development and design techniques, 46 for measurement and testing, and the remaining 155 for quality control and quality check.

Besides our own technical force, we also have cooperation arrangements with leading universities in the automotive engineering field, including:
 

● | In 2010, SORL created two new post-doctoral research programs. The first program is a partnership with the Automobile Institute of Jilin University. This program was established to conduct research on the recovery of electric vehicle braking energy. The second program is a partnership with the Beijing University of Technology. This program was established to conduct researches on die-casting aluminum oxide film onto auto parts. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We have contracts with both Tongji University at Shanghai and Harbin Institute of Technology for co-development of electronically controlled braking systems and automotive master cable technology. 
● | We have contracts with both Tsinghua University E-Tech Technology Co., Ltd. and Zhejiang University for information technology projects, including the development of application software for product design innovation and production management. 

 
We have priority rights to acquire the intellectual properties that are developed pursuant to the arrangements with these universities. The financial arrangements as to amount and terms of payment vary depending on the type of project. Normally, we make an initial payment in the form of a research grant and then negotiate a payment schedule based upon development of the technology.
 
We also consult with the technical staff of the Ruili Group from time to time at a no-cost basis. We have collaborated with other industry research groups, such as the research centers of FAW Group and Dongfeng Group.
 
We own a full range of processing equipment required for the development of new auto part products, including machines for molding, die casting, cutting, pressing and surface treatment. Furthermore, we are capable of designing and making over 90% of the devices, such as tools, jigs and molds, that are required for producing prototypes. Last but not the least, the partnerships with Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University in developing software for application in our new product design system have leaded to substantial time savings in our new product development cycle.
 
Patented Technologies
 
We continue to invest in research and development (“R&D”) efforts and to pursue patent protection. Currently we own 745 issued patents and 870 patent applications worldwide.
 
Trademarks
 
Our principal trademark is “SORL”, which we currently licensed on a non-exclusive royalty free basis from the Ruili Group. The license currently expires in the year of 2022 and we have an agreement with the Ruili Group that the term of the license will be extended as long as the registration for the trademark is renewed. The Ruili Group obtained the registration for “SORL” from the World Intellectual Property Organization and registered the trademark in the United States in 2007 as well.
PRODUCTION
 
Our production processes include fixture, jig and die making, aluminum alloy die casting, metal sheet stamping, numerical control cutting, welding, numerical control processing, surface treatment, filming, rubber/plastic processing, final assembly and packaging. We have state-of-the-art manufacturing and testing facilities sourced from the U.S., South Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, including computerized numerical control processing centers, computerized numerical control lathes, casting, stamping and cutting machines, automatic spraying and electroplating lines, cleaning machines, automatic assembly lines and three-dimensional coordinate measuring machines and projectors. We are seeking to realize automation to reduce production cost. 
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 
The Company is subject to the applicable requirements of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. authorities, including China’s, environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. The Company has an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support its compliance with these requirements globally. Although the Company intends to comply with all such requirements and regulations, it cannot assure that it is at all times in compliance. The Company has made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, although such expenditures were not material during the past two years. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have the tendency to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not be material.
 
In 2006, we were granted ISO14001 certification on environmental management (ISO 14000 is a family of standards related to environmental management that exists to help organizations minimize the negative impact of their operations on the environment and comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations, and rules) and OHSAS18001 certification on health and safety management, which reflects the Company’s commitment to workplace safety, health and environmental protection. We conduct staff training to enhance awareness of environmental issues. We seek in all phases of our operations to employ practices for environment friendly production, reduction or prevention of pollution, and reduction of energy consumption and manufacturing costs. For example, noise intensity is listed as one of the criteria in the selection of new equipment; waste water is stored, purified and recycled in the production processes; and compressing machines are used in the disposal of aluminum and steel scraps, saving both storage space and power consumption.

During 2018, the Company did not make any material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of our products primarily include steel, aluminum, other metals, rubber and various manufactured components.
 
All of the materials we use generally are readily available from numerous sources. We have not, in recent years, experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or raw materials, and we normally do not carry inventories of these items in excess of what are reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. Critical raw materials are generally supplied from at least two or more vendors to assure adequate supply and reasonable price. We maintain relationships with over twenty material suppliers. In 2018, our three largest suppliers were Shanghai Shougang Steel Trading Co., Ltd., Shanghai Bao Steel Trading Co., Ltd., and Nanjing Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. which together accounted for 9.5% of the total purchase. None of the suppliers accounted for more than 10% of the total purchases.


When planning a purchase order, we compare prices of comparable goods quoted by different suppliers to receive the lowest price. In order to secure a favorable purchase price and subsequently a predictable cost of sales, we generally make a down payment to suppliers.
 
Normally, our annual purchase plan for raw materials, such as aluminum ingot and steel sheet, are determined at the beginning of the calendar year according to our OEM customers’ orders and our own forecast for the aftermarket and international sales. Our purchase plans with key suppliers can be revised quarterly. Our actual requirements are based on monthly production plans. Management believes that this arrangement prevents us from having excessive inventories when the orders from our customers change.
 
For raw materials, other than steel and aluminum, we generally maintain from five to seven days of inventory at our warehouse.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company believes that its engineering and technical expertise, together with its emphasis on continuing research and development, allow it to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for its customers and bring new, innovative products to market. The Company believes that continued research and development activities, including engineering, are critical to maintain its pipeline of technologically advanced products.
DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA
 
China’s Economy
 
Management believes that an important factor that affects the Chinese automobile industry is the country’s economic environment. According to China’s Statistics Bureau, China’s economic growth slowed down during the last three years, with a GDP growth rate for 2016, 2017 and 2018, of 6.7%, 6.9% and 6.6%, respectively.
The Chinese Legal System
 
The practical effect of the legal system in China on our business operations can be viewed from two separate but intertwined considerations. First, as a matter of substantive law, the laws regarding foreign invested enterprises provide significant protection against government interference. In addition, these laws to a large extent protect the full enjoyment of the benefits of corporate organizational documents and contracts to foreign invested enterprise participants. These laws, however, do impose standards concerning corporate formation and governance, which are not qualitatively different from the general corporation laws of the several states of the United States. Similarly, the accounting standards and regulations in China mandate certain accounting practices, which are not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Chinese accounting standards and regulations require that an annual “statutory audit” be performed in accordance with China’s accounting standards and that the books of account of foreign invested enterprise are maintained in accordance with the Chinese accounting standards and regulations.

Second, while the enforcement of substantive rights may appear less certain or reliable than under the legal system in the United States, foreign invested enterprises and wholly foreign-owned enterprises are Chinese registered companies that enjoy the same legal status as other Chinese registered companies in business-to-business dispute resolutions. Because the terms of the respective Articles of Association of the Joint Venture (“Articles of Association”) provide that all business disputes pertaining to foreign invested enterprises are to be resolved by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm, Sweden applying Chinese substantive law, the Chinese minority partner in the Joint Venture should not enjoy a privileged position regarding such disputes. Any award rendered by this arbitration tribunal is, by the express terms of the Articles of Association, enforceable in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). Therefore, as a practical matter, although no assurances can be given, the Chinese legal infrastructure, while different from its United States counterpart, should not present any significant impediment to the operation of foreign invested enterprises.
 
Economic Reform Issues
 
Although the Chinese government controls many productive assets in China, in the past several years the government has implemented economic reform measures which emphasize decentralization and encourage private economic activities. Because these economic reform measures may be inconsistent or ineffectual, there are no assurances that:

● | We will be able to capitalize on economic reforms; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Chinese government will continue its pursuit of economic reform policies; 
● | The economic policies, even if pursued, will be successful; 
● | Economic policies will not be significantly altered from time to time; and 
● | Business operations in China will not become subject to the risk of nationalization. 

 
Since 1979, the Chinese government has embarked reforms of its economic structure. Because many reforms are unprecedented or experimental, they are subject to risks and setbacks. Other political, economic and social factors, such as political changes, changes in the rates of economic growth, unemployment or inflation, or the disparities in per capita wealth between regions within China, could lead to further adjustment of the reform measures. This refining and adjustment process may negatively affect our operations.
 
There can be no assurance that the reforms to China’s economic systems will continue or that we will not be adversely affected by changes in China’s political, economic, and social conditions and by changes in policies of the Chinese government, such as changes in laws and regulations, measures which may be introduced to control inflation, changes in the rate or method of taxation, imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion and remittance abroad, and reduction in tariff protection and other import restrictions.
 
EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
 
The Company currently employs 6,459 employees, all of whom are employed full time and are grouped as follows: 556 technical staffs and quality control and quality check, 222 sales and marketing staffs, 5,547 production workers and 134 administrative staffs. There are employment agreements with all of the employees. We believe that the employment contracts with all our employees comply with relevant laws and regulations of China. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement.
 
The Joint Venture is subject to labor regulations applicable to Sino-Foreign equity joint venture enterprises. Only in compliance with those regulations, may the Joint Venture’s management hire and discharge employees and make other determinations with respect to wages, welfare plans, insurance coverages and disciplinary action with respect to its employees. The Joint Venture has, as required by law, established special funds for enterprise development, employee welfare and incentives, as well as a general reserve. In addition, the Joint Venture is required to provide its employees with facilities sufficient to enable the employees to carry out union activities.
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE JOINT VENTURE
 
General
 
The Joint Venture was established on January 17, 2004, pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement with the Ruili Group. Below is a description of the material terms of the Joint Venture.
 
10

 

Management of the Joint Venture
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, the board of directors of the Joint Venture consists of three directors. We have the right to designate two members of the board of directors and the Ruili Group has the right to designate one member. We also have the authority to appoint the Chairman of the board of directors. The majority of the board of directors is vested with the authority with respect to operating matters. As a result, we maintain operating control over the Joint Venture. However, at this time, three of the directors of the Joint Venture, Messrs. Xiao Ping Zhang, Xiao Feng Zhang and Ms. Shu Ping Chi, are also directors of us and the founders and executives of the Ruili Group, and therefore there is limited independence between the two entities. The term of the Joint Venture has got permission to be Long-Term effective from the Government on March 2018.
 
Distribution of Profits of the Joint Venture
 
After providing social welfare funds for employees and withholding applicable taxes, the profits, if any, of the Joint Venture are available for distribution to the parties in proportion to their respective capital contributions. Any such distributions must be authorized by the Joint Venture’s board of directors. To date, the Joint Venture has not distributed any profits and does not anticipate of doing so in the foreseeable future.
 
Transfer of Interest in the Joint Venture
 
Any assignment or transfer of an interest in the Joint Venture must be approved by the Chinese government. The Chinese joint venture laws also provide for preemptive rights and any proposed transfer to third parties requires the consent of all parties to the joint venture.
 
Liquidation of the Joint Venture
 
Under the Chinese joint venture laws, the Joint Venture may be liquidated in certain limited circumstances, including the expiration of the term of the Joint Venture (including extensions, if any), the inability for the joint venture to continue operations due to severe losses, force majeure, or the failure of a party to perform its obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement or the Articles of Association in such a manner as to impair the operations of the Joint Venture. The Chinese joint venture laws provide that, upon liquidation, the net asset value (based on the prevailing market value of the assets) of a joint venture shall be distributed to the parties in proportion to their respective registered capital in the joint venture.
 
Resolution of Disputes Related to the Joint Venture
 
In the event of a dispute between the parties, attempts will be made to resolve the dispute through friendly consultation or mediation. In the absence of a friendly resolution, the parties have agreed that the matter will first be referred to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission in Beijing, China, whose decisions are final and enforceable in Chinese courts.
Nationalization of Foreign Investments
 
The Chinese joint venture laws provide that China generally will not nationalize enterprises in which foreign funds have been invested. However, under special circumstances, for example, when public interest requires, enterprises with foreign capital may be legally nationalized and appropriate compensation will be made.
