Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company with the near-term goal of becoming a self-sustained, integrated pharmaceutical company that is focused on pediatric health care. In November 2017 we acquired TRx Pharmaceuticals, LLC and it wholly-owned subsidiaries (see "Acquisition of TRx Pharmaceuticals") and in February 2018 we purchased and acquired all rights to Avadel Pharmaceuticals PLC's ("Avadel's") marketed pediatric products (see "Acquisition of Avadel Products"). 
We have a diversified portfolio of products and product candidates in development with a focus on patients with rare neurological disorders or orphan diseases. Our lead marketed products are:
Prescribed Dietary Supplements: Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are prescribed vitamin and fluoride supplements used in infants and children to treat or prevent deficiency of essential vitamins and fluoride, often caused by poor diet or low levels of fluoride in drinking water and other sources. Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor are available in various formulations, including an oral suspension and chewable tablets.
Prescription Drugs: The Company has three prescription drugs,. Millipred®, Veripred® and Ulesfia®. Millipred and Veripred are branded prescription formulations for prednisolone, which is a corticosteroid and is commonly used to treat inflammation of the skin, joints, lungs and other organs. It can also be prescribed for treatments including asthma, allergies and arthritis. Ulesfia (benzyl alcohol) 5% Lotion is indicated for the topical treatment of head lice infestation in patients 6 months of age and older. Our prescription portfolio was expanded in February 2018 (see “Acquisition of Avadel Products) and further consiste of Karbinal™ ER, AcipHex® Sprinkle™, Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, and Flexichamber™
Our strategy is to enhance shareholder value by:

• | Growing sales of the existing products in our portfolio, including by identifying and investing in growth opportunities such as new treatment indications and new geographic markets;


• | Acquiring or licensing rights to clinically meaningful and differentiated products that are already on the market for pediatric use or product candidates that are in late-stage development for pediatric indications that are near market launch; and


• | Pursuing targeted clinical-stage development assets that are differentiated product candidates for rare neurological disorders or orphan diseases.

We apply a disciplined decision making methodology as we evaluate the optimal allocation of our resources between investing in our current commercial product line, our development portfolio and acquisitions or in-licensing of new assets.
Our research and development activities currently include development of new product candidates, activities related to new indications for existing products and the generation of additional clinical data for existing product candidates. A summary of our ongoing development activities is provided below:
CERC-301: Orphan Neurological Indications. CERC‑301 belongs to a class of compounds known as antagonists of the N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate, or NMDA, receptor, a receptor subtype of the glutamate neurotransmitter system that is responsible for controlling neurologic adaptation. We believe CERC‑301 selectively blocks the NMDA receptor subunit 2B, or NR2B (also called GluN2B). We intend to initiate a Phase I study in 2018 for neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”), a condition that is part of a larger category called orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is also known as postural hypotension. nOH is caused by dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system and causes people to feel faint when they stand or sit up. We will continue to explore the use of CERC-301 in orphan neurologic conditions in preclinical and clinical studies.

• | CERC-611: Adjunctive Treatment of Partial-Onset Seizures in Epilepsy. CERC-611, is a preclinical asset that is a potent and selective antagonist of transmembrane alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor regulatory protein (“TARP”)-γ8-dependent AMPA receptor. We believe CERC-611 is the first drug candidate to selectively target and functionally block region-specific AMPA receptors after oral dosing, which we believe may improve the efficacy and side effect profile of CERC-611 over current anti-epileptics. Research also suggests that selectively targeting individual TARPs may enable selective modulation of specific brain circuits without globally affecting synaptic transmission. We intend to develop CERC-611 as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, in patients with epilepsy.

The Company has two preclinical stage development candidates that are selective catechol-O-methyltransferase or COMT inhibitors: 

• | CERC-406 and CERC-425: We believe these compounds have potential for treatments associated with motoric and non-motoric symptoms of Parkinson's Disease as well as other psychiatric and neurological conditions frequently impacted by impaired cognition.

We plan both to evaluate our current portfolio for potential new indications and to identify new product candidates for development. 

Members of our management team have extensive pharmaceutical product development and commercialization experience and they have played key roles in development or commercialization. Collectively, our officers and directors have contributed to the submission of numerous Investigational New Drug Applications (“INDs”) and New Drug Applications (NDAs”) to the FDA, and commercial launch post FDA approval.
Acquisition of TRx Pharmaceuticals
On November 17, 2017, we acquired TRx, including its wholly-owned subsidiary Zylera Pharmaceuticals, LLC and its franchise of commercial medications led by Poly-Vi-Flor® (multivitamin and fluoride supplement tablet, chewable) and Tri-Vi-Flor® (multivitamin and fluoride supplement suspension/drops). Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $18.9 million in cash and $8.1 million in Cerecor common stock. TRx shareholders will be eligible to receive up to an additional $7 million in contingent payments upon achievement of certain commercial and regulatory milestones.
The acquisition of TRx and its subsidiaries is a pivotal move in our strategic shift towards an integrated pediatric pharmaceutical company. Operationally, we believe the transaction adds a highly-effective commercial unit that will drive a solid revenue stream to help us advance our pipeline of drug candidates for rare neurologic or orphan diseases. 
Acquisition of Avadel Products
On February 16, 2018, we acquired all rights in the Avadel U.S. Holdings, Inc’s marketed pediatric products for a nominal cash payment and assumption of certain of Avadel’s financial obligations to Deerfield CSF, LLC, which include a $15 million loan due in January 2021 and certain royalty obligations through February 2026. The acquired products consist of Karbinal™ ER, AcipHex® Sprinkle™, Cefaclor for Oral Suspension, and Flexichamber™. Additionally, Avadel Ireland will develop and provide Cerecor with four stable product formulations of Cerecor’s choosing utilizing its proprietary LiquiTime™ and Micropump® technology. Three of these development projects are already underway.
Related Party Arrangements
Lachlan Pharmaceuticals
In November 2017, we acquired Zylera Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Zylera) as part of the acquisition of TRx. Each of the previous owners of TRx beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Zylera, which is now our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into the First Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement (the “Lachlan Agreement”) with Lachlan Pharmaceuticals, an Irish company controlled by the previous owners (“Lachlan”), effective December 18, 2015. Pursuant to the Lachlan Agreement, Lachlan named Zylera as its exclusive distributor of Ulesfia in the U.S. and agreed to supply Ulesfia to Zylera exclusively for marketing and sale in the U.S. The Lachlan Agreement provides that all trademark rights used in connection with Ulesfia will remain the intellectual property of Lachlan, and all goodwill associated with the use of the trademarks for the marketing and sale of Ulesfia in the territory will inure to the sole benefit of Lachlan. The Lachlan Agreement term continues as long as (i) there exists an issued and unexpired patent right for the product in the United States, or (ii) no generic version of the product is being sold in the United States. The Lachlan Agreement can be terminated by Zylera upon the introduction of a generic product in the territory or upon the expiration or invalidity of all patent rights for the product in the territory.
Pursuant to an amended and restated distribution agreement entered into between Zylera and Lachlan dated, December 18, 2015. Zylera is obligated to purchase a minimum of 20,000 units per year, or approximately $1,177,000 worth of product, from Lachlan, subject to certain termination rights. Zylera must pay Lachlan management handling fees that are equal to $3.66 
2

per unit of fully packaged Ulesfia in 2018, and escalate at a rate of 10% annually, as well as reimburse Lachlan for all product liability insurance fees incurred by Lachlan. The distribution agreement also requires that Zylera make certain cumulative net sales milestone payments and royalty payments to Lachlan with a $3,000,000 annual minimum payment unless and until there has been a “Market Change” involving a new successful competitive product. Lachlan is obligated to pay identical amounts to an unrelated third party from which it obtained rights to Ulesfia. 
On December 10, 2016, Zylera informed Lachlan that a market change had occurred due to the introduction of Arbor Pharmaceutical’s lice product, Sklice®. According to the terms of the distribution agreement if there is a market change, the minimum purchase obligation is void. On June 5, 2017, Lachlan and Zylera entered into joint legal representation along with other unrelated third parties in negotiation and arbitration of dispute with Summers Laboratory, Inc. regarding the ongoing arbitration proceeding with the ultimate recipient of the royalties over whether a Market Change has occurred. The Company has not made any payments to Lachlan in 2017 under the Lachlan Agreement (from the acquisition date through year-end). 
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become an integrated pediatric specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes pediatric nutritional supplements and prescription medicines. We plan to use the proceeds generated from the profits of our portfolio of pediatric products towards the development of drug candidates that have unique mechanisms of action and can be applied towards patients with rare neurological and orphan diseases. We systematically identify potential development candidates, ideally those for which human proof of concept exists in the intended indication, for either the target or the compound. We target conditions where current treatments fail to address unmet medical needs, and where we believe we can apply clinical strategies to increase efficacy signal detection with a view to optimizing the clinical development and regulatory pathway for our product candidates.
Our key strategic objectives include:

• | Generate revenue through sales of marketed pediatric products acquired from TRx and Avadel.


• | Develop other products, including CERC-301 as an adjunctive therapy for Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”), and the product candidates under our development arrangement with Avadel.


• | Pursue opportunistic acquisitions of additional complementary marketed products and development stage companies. We will identify, along with Avadel Ireland, four stable product formulations of Cerecor’s choosing utilizing its proprietary LiquiTime™ and Micropump® technology. Cerecor has chosen three of these development projects which are already underway. 

Product Pipeline
The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates and further detail regarding each product candidate follows:

Product Candidate / Platform | Potential Indication(s) | Stage of Development | Anticipated Milestones

Disease Overview
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension
Disease Overview and Treatment Limitations
While listed as an orphan condition affecting less than 200,000 patients in the U.S., neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) results from failure of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to regulate blood pressure in response to postural change, due to an inadequate release of norepinephrine (NE). This leads to both orthostatic hypotension upon standing and supine hypertension when lying. nOH is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple systems atrophy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and primary autonomic failure. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and nOH is a commonly encountered clinical problem in patients with PD, perhaps affecting up to 40%-60% of patients throughout the multi-decade disease course. nOH constitutes and area in which there is still significant unmet medical need. 
Current treatment options for nOH are targeted towards reduced symptom burdens to increase quality of life such as correcting aggravating factors (i.e. discontinuation of hypotension drugs and correction of anemia and vitamin deficiencies); implementing nonpharmacologic measures such as intravascular volume expansion, increased physical activity, reduction of meal size, compression stocking/abdominal binder, and sleeping arrangement; and drug therapies (i.e. droxidopa, midrodrine, fludrocortisone, pyridostigmine, atomoxetine). 
Unmet Needs
Northera (droxidopa), the most recently approved product, has the following clinical profile, from their product insert, which shows efficacy in patients with a 0.9 unit improvement in an 11 point dizziness scale. The effect of Northera did not persist beyond Week 1 and it had the lowest standing systolic blood pressure within 3 minutes after standing also increased by 5.6 mm Hg. Twenty-eight percent (28%) of patients on Northera discontinued treatment prematurely versus 20% on placebo due to headache, dizziness, nausea and hypertension. 
CERC‑301
Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH)
We acquired MK‑0657, which is now known as CERC‑301, from Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, in 2013 through an exclusive worldwide license. CERC‑301 is an oral and selective NR2B antagonist that we are developing as a novel oral medication for patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypertension (“nOH”). We believe CERC‑301 may have efficacy with greater tolerability and have fewer side effects than the treatments currently available. We expect that a drug with these attributes would lead to improved compliance and outcomes. We believe CERC-301 may have rapid effects and my reduce the hypertension side effects of other treatments.
Our Program
Our plan is to develop, register and commercialize CERC-301 as a therapy for the treatment of nOH. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 safety study for nOH in 2018. If we are successful in demonstrating continued safety and tolerability in these studies we anticipate progressing development into Phase 2 efficacy and dose ranging studies in nOH.
Epilepsy
Disease Overview and Treatment Limitations
It is estimated the epilepsy patient population in the US, Japan, and five major EU markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK) will increase from 4.6 million cases in 2012 to 5.1 million cases by 2020, representing an increase of 10.7%. The US will have the largest number of diagnosed epilepsy cases across the aforementioned markets, with approximately 2.35 million patients by 2020. It has been reported that there are approximately 150,000 new cases of epilepsy diagnosed annually in the US 
4

alone. Epilepsy constitutes an area in which there is still significant unmet medical need, with up to 40% of patients not achieving seizure freedom despite therapy with currently available antiepileptic drugs, or AEDs.
Epilepsy is broadly classified according to whether the contributing seizures are partial-onset or generalized. While the two subtypes produce seizures with different characteristics, the differentiation is most important when deciding upon the appropriate course of treatment. Certain therapies are more effective in partial-onset or generalized seizures, and drugs only gain approval for the seizure subtype in which there is proven efficacy.
Current AED therapies target a variety of mechanisms, including gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, receptor agonism, T-type calcium channel blockers, sodium channel modulators, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, or SV2A, modulation, and inhibition of GABA transaminase. More recently, AMPA receptor antagonists have been investigated and approved for treatment of epilepsy as well. The chosen AEDs are very similar for partial-onset seizures, irrespective of whether patients respond to treatment or remain refractory. The sum of all drugs patient shares in the Datamonitor Healthcare survey is over 200%, suggesting that the typical patient receives two AEDs on average to control their treatment-refractory partial-onset seizures. This trend is apparent in each of the US, Japan, and the five major EU markets.
Unmet Needs
Continuous medication with AEDs is necessary even after the seizures have long been suppressed with treatments. AEDs can prevent seizures from happening but are not effective in stopping seizures once they are underway and do not cure epilepsy; that is, they are anti-seizure, but not anti-epileptogenic. Therefore, currently available AEDs should be classified as symptomatic drugs against ictogenesis.
No marketed or pipeline drugs have yet demonstrated anti-epileptogenic properties in humans. In the past 20 years, many new AEDs have come on to the market with the promise of improved seizure control and minimal side effects. Nevertheless, there remain several key unmet needs in the treatment of epilepsy that pharmaceutical companies can target: effective treatments for refractory epilepsy subtypes, AEDs with safer and more tolerable side-effect profiles, and better treatment options for elderly patients.
CERC-611
Adjunctive Treatment of Partial-Onset Seizures in Epilepsy
We acquired LY3130481, which is now known as CERC-611, from Lilly in June 2016 through an exclusive worldwide license. We believe CERC-611is the first molecule to selectively target and functionally block region-specific AMPA receptors after oral dosing. This selectivity was engineered into CERC-611 by chemical SAR studies to achieve selective blockade of the AMPA receptor regulator protein or TARP γ8 (high density in hippocampus, a region of importance in partial-onset epilepsies) while sparing AMPA receptors associated with TARP γ-2 (high density in cerebellum regulating the ataxia and falling associated with perampanel-Fycompa™). Because of the predominant hippocampal location of TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptors, we believe that the efficacy and side effect profile of CERC-611 may be improved compared to current antiepileptics.
We believe CERC-611 may:

• | Have efficacy in refractory partial-onset seizures as an adjunctive therapy. It may be uniquely qualified to treat temporal lobe seizures, unlike any other current or pipeline therapy, due to its selectivity for the TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptors 


• | Lack sedative, ataxic, or falling side effects of global AMPA receptor antagonists such as perampanel-Fycompa™


• | Have a reduced or absent requirement for multi-week dose titration


• | Potentially mitigate some of the side-effect liabilities associated with other conjointly administered antiepileptic medications.

Emergence of AMPA Receptor Antagonists as Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs)
AMPA receptors are glutamate-sensitive ion channels on postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and are largely responsible for mediating fast neurotransmission across synaptic gaps. AMPA receptor antagonists are known anticonvulsant agents and their ability to down modulate excitatory neurotransmission is key to their anti-epileptic 
5

therapeutic potential. However, because AMPA receptor activity is so ubiquitous in the central nervous system, or CNS, general antagonism affects most areas of the CNS, resulting in undesired effects, such as ataxia, falls, sedation, and/or dizziness, which are shared by all known general or broad spectrum AMPA receptor antagonists, e.g., parampanel, talampanel. Typically, these general or broad-spectrum antagonists have a very narrow therapeutic dosing window, meaning that typically the doses needed to obtain anticonvulsant activity are close to or overlap with doses at which undesired effects are observed.
TARPs are a fairly recently discovered family of proteins that have been found to associate with and modulate the activity of AMPA receptors. Several TARPs are fairly region-specific in the brain, leading to physiological differentiation of the AMPA receptor activity. As for example, TARP γ8 (stargazing)-dependent AMPA receptors are primarily localized in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex and TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptors are localized primarily in the hippocampus, a region particularly relevant to seizures origination and/or propagation. It has been theorized that targeting individual TARPs may enable selective modulation of specific brain circuits without globally affecting synaptic transmission.
Our Program
Our plan is to develop, register and commercialize CERC-611 as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures, in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older. Once an IND has been reviewed and approved we plan to initiate Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical studies. If we are successful in demonstrating continued safety and tolerability in these studies we anticipate progressing development into Phase 2 efficacy and dose ranging studies in epilepsy.
COMTi Platform
In 2013, we acquired rights to our COMTi platform by means of an exclusive, worldwide license from Merck. COMT is an enzyme that is critical for the inactivation and metabolism of dopamine and its inhibition in the brain has potential applicability in treating subjects with neuropsychiatric conditions, including MDD, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and pathological gambling. We believe compounds from this platform increase dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex, or PFC, which is the region of the brain that is responsible for working memory, attention tasks and decision making, all of which are human attributes that we collectively refer to as executive function. We have selected CERC-406 as our first preclinical candidate from the COMTi platform. We anticipate establishing the data set necessary to select additional preclinical lead candidates for treatment of various conditions where impaired executive function is a core symptom, subject to the availability of funding. These programs will target the improvement of working memory and executive function, which are key components of cognition.
Entacapone and tolcapone are two commercially available COMT inhibitors used to treat aspects of Parkinson’s disease. Both drugs inhibit COMT outside of the nervous system, or peripheral COMT, and may be administered, with levodopa, which is the precursor to the neurotransmitter dopamine, multiple times per day. Tolcapone, which has modest brain penetration and inhibits brain COMT, is hampered by side effects including diarrhea and liver toxicity. Entacapone does not penetrate the brain. Because of these factors, neither drug is used clinically to treat executive function impairment. Nonetheless, pilot studies using tolcapone have repeatedly suggested an improvement in aspects of executive function in normal volunteers and in subjects with various conditions that are associated with cognitive impairment. Improvements in aspects of the underlying conditions were also found.
CERC‑406 and CERC-425
CERC‑406 and CERC-425 are orally active small, molecules and are selective COMT inhibitors with low inhibitory activity on peripheral COMT. We intend to develop CERC‑406 as an oral adjunctive medication for patients with residual cognitive impairment symptoms. We selected CERC‑406 as our lead preclinical candidate from our COMTi platform because in preclinical testing we observed that it had lower potential of peripheral, off target side effects, rapid absorption and bioavailability, good brain penetration and a favorable dose‑dependent biomarker profile in rats. We have also observed that CERC‑406 has an off‑rate on brain COMT that is slower than tolcapone, potentially implying a good duration of effect. In preclinical studies it appears that CERC‑406 may have favorable drug distribution and metabolism properties, suggesting that it has the potential to be administered orally on a once or twice daily basis. Similarly, CERC-425 is an orally active small molecule, COMT inhibitor also being explored for neurologic conditions.
We believe that CERC‑406 may:

• | demonstrate efficacy as it is a brain penetrant COMT inhibitor with selectivity for MB‑COMT to target the PFC dopamine deficit in this patient population;

6


• | be more effective in Val homozygotes population, who have higher levels of COMT activity and lower prefrontal dopamine receptor activation; and


• | be safer than existing COMT inhibitors- which are associated with adverse events such as liver toxicity and diarrhea.

Our Program
We anticipate developing CERC‑406 for the enhancement of executive function and working memory in patients with diseases of impaired motoric functions, where we believe a new therapy with efficacy in residual cognitive symptoms may be associated with improved functional outcomes.
We anticipate advancing the characterization of the safety and efficacy of CERC‑406 and CERC-425 in preclinical animal studies, to advance manufacturing of product for potential clinical trials, and to file their IND, subject to the availability of additional funding.
Business Development Activities
We are considering strategic transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and in‑licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including strategic partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, business combinations and investments. We believe we have the ability to identify, evaluate and procure valuable product programs that are consistent with our goal of becoming a leader in the development of innovative drugs for patients suffering from rare and orphan diseases. We plan to continue to evaluate these opportunities to expand our product candidate portfolio in a fashion that fits within our core strategy and enhances our overall value.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, we have issued patents covering the compounds and compositions of CERC-301, CERC‑611, CERC-406 and CERC-425. We also may rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know‑how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know‑how, continuing technological innovation and in‑licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of central nervous system disorders.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post‑grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below.

• | CERC‑301. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell certain NR2B antagonist compounds. The CERC‑301 patent portfolio consists of three patent families. The first family consists of patents that have issued in the United States (U.S.), Australia, Canada, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Japan. The patents in the first family include composition of matter and use claims of varying scope, including picture claims to CERC‑301 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The expiration date of the U.S. patent in the first family is August 31, 2026, not including any patent term extension or market exclusivity period which may apply. The second family consists of patents that have issued in U.S., Germany, France, and United Kingdom.The patents in the second family include composition of matter claims (in U.S. patent only) and use claims that generically cover CERC‑301. The expiration date of the U.S. patent is June 3, 2022, not including any potential patent term extension or market exclusivity period.The third family consists of patent applications in U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan, with claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and methods of manufacture. Any patents issuing from these applications would expire in December 2035 at the earliest, not including any potential patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or market exclusivity period.


• | CERC-611. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell LY3130481, now known as CERC‑611. The CERC-611 patent portfolio consists of two patent families. The first family consists of patents that have issued in U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Ukraine, and Vietnam, and over 20 international patent applications with composition of matter and use claims for CERC-611. The expiration date of the U.S. patent, exclusive of any patent term extension, is November 20, 2033. The second family consists of patents that have issued in U.S., Australia, and South Korea, and international patent applications with composition of matter and use claims of varying scope for additional selective TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptor antagonists. The expiration date of the U.S. patent, exclusive of any patent term extension, is May 21, 2035.


• | CERC‑406, CERC-425 and COMTi Platform. We possess worldwide exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell COMT inhibitor compounds. The COMT patent portfolio consists of two patent families. The first family consists of patents that have issued in U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Russia, and patent applications in Brazil, Europe, and India. The expiration date of the U.S. patent in the first family, exclusive of any patent term extension, is February 28, 2031. The second family consists of patents that have issued in U.S., Australia, China, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Russia, and patent applications in Brazil, Canada, and India. The expiration date of the U.S. patent in the second family, exclusive of any patent term extension, is February 28, 2031. 

The term of any individual patent depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries where we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non‑provisional patent application.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA‑approved drug that contains an active ingredient or salt or ester of the active ingredient that has not previously been marketed may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration to account for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is based upon one half of the time between the IND effective date and a company’s initial submission of a marketing application, plus the entire time between the submission of the marketing application and the FDA’s approval of the application. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non‑United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
For all of our product candidates, we intend to explore at each stage of the drug discovery process opportunities for follow‑on patent filings to maximize patent terms and market exclusivities. Such follow‑on patent filings may be directed to new indications, formulations, combination therapies, manufacturing methods, dosages, routes of administration, patient populations, contraindications, drug interactions (or absence of interactions) or other aspects of drug labels.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to 
8

our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce our drug candidates in accordance with applicable provisions of the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, regulations for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive GMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control.

On September 22, 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”) pursuant to which the Company received exclusive, global rights to develop and commercialize CERC-611, previously referred to as LY3130481, a potent and selective Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Proteins (“TARP”) ã-8-dependent á-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (“AMPA”) receptor antagonist. The terms of the license agreement provide for an upfront payment of $2.0 million, of which $750,000 was due within 30 days of the effective date of the license agreement, and the remaining balance of $1.25 million is due after the first subject is dosed with CERC-611 in a multiple ascending dose study and is recorded as license obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2017. Additional payments may be due upon achievement of development and commercialization milestones, including the first commercial sale. Upon commercialization, the Company is obligated to pay Lilly milestone payments and a royalty on net sales.
Merck CERC-301 License 
In 2013, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) pursuant to which Merck granted the Company rights relating to certain small molecule compounds. In consideration of the license, the Company paid an initial payment of $750,000, and upon achievement of acceptance by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of Merck pre-clinical data and FDA approval of a Phase 3 clinical trial the Company will pay an additional $750,000. Additional payments may be due upon achievement of development and regulatory milestones, including the first commercial sale. Upon commercialization, the Company is obligated to pay Merck milestone payments and royalties on net sales. 
Merck CERC-406 License
In 2013, the Company entered into a separate exclusive license agreement with Merck pursuant to which Merck granted the Company certain rights in small molecule compounds which are known to inhibit the activity of COMT. In consideration of the license, the Company made a $200,000 upfront payment to Merck. Additional payments may be due upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Upon commercialization of a COMT product, the Company is required to pay Merck royalties on net sales.
Poly-Vi-Flor® and Tri-Vi-Flor® Related Contracts
Supply and License Agreement, effective December 1, 2014, by and between TRx and Merck & Cie (“Merck”)
On December 1, 2014 TRx entered into a Supply and License Agreement with Merck. The initial term of the agreement expires on December 31, 2020, and the agreement will automatically continue for subsequent one year terms thereafter until terminated in accordance with its terms. Pursuant to the agreement, Merck agrees to supply a specific compound called Metafolin® to TRx for use in dietary supplements within a defined market, and TRx agrees to purchase 100% of its Metafolin requirements from Merck. Under the agreement, TRx has an exclusive license under a number of U.S. and international patents, as well as related trade secrets, know-how and trademark rights, to make and sell TRx products positioned in the pediatric market (i.e., 
9

targeted for children 0-3 years of age) in the U.S. Under the agreement, TRx also has a non-exclusive license under the same intellectual property rights to make and sell TRx dietary supplement products within the U.S. outside of certain specified fields, including products containing Metafolin in combination with folic acid or any other folate, products positioned for type II diabetes, pharmaceutical drugs, and medical, fortified, and special dietary foods. TRx must also pay Merck a royalty of two-percent (2%) of net sales from TRx products in the pediatric field that contain Metafolin. The royalty payment does not apply to net sales of TRx products marketed as pre-or postnatal vitamins. The royalty payment will continue to apply throughout the initial term and any automatic renewal periods. The minimum annual order quantity for the compound is 1kg. Additionally, the insurance provision in the agreement requires TRx to procure and maintain general comprehensive liability insurance covering each occurrence of bodily injury and property damage in an amount of not less than a $3,000,000 combined single limit. Payments of royalties are made by TRx within 45 days following the end of each calendar quarter.
Settlement and License Agreement, dated February 28, 2011, by and between TRx and Mead Johnson and Company LLC, as amended
TRx entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Mead Johnson and Company LLC, and the parties subsequently entered into an amendment to such agreement on October 6, 2011. Pursuant to the agreement, Mead Johnson granted TRx an exclusive license to the “Poly-Vi-Flor” and “Tri-ViFlor” trademarks and agreed not to oppose TRx’s seeking the marks Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-ViFlor in the United States and in any other countries where Mead Johnson does not have an active rregistration for such marks.  As consideration for such licenses, TRx agreed to pay a royalty to Mead Johnson in the amount of 10% of net revenues received by TRx with respect to products sold under the PolyVi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor trademarks during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement is indefinite and will continue unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of the agreement. The agreement requires that the TRx products sold under the Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-ViFlor trademarks adhere to specified quality requirements, and such products are subject to inspection by Mead Johnson on a periodic basis. The agreement also prohibits TRx’s ability to sublicense the Poly-Vi-Flor and Tri-Vi-Flor trademarks and provides that TRx will use its best efforts to ensure that its products are not displayed or marketed in association with any Mead Johnson products. Payments are made by TRx in arrears on a quarterly basis within 45 days after the end of a given calendar quarter. 
Redemption Agreement with Additional Poly-Vi-Flor® Royalty Obligation
TRx and the Selling Members entered into an Agreement to Redeem Membership Interest on May 31, 2011 with a former Member, Presmar Associates, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement, TRx and the Selling Members agreed to pay to Presmar Associates a royalty payment of 5% of gross sales for Poly-Vi-Flor® branded or authorized generic product and, upon the sale of the Poly-Vi-Flor trademark to a third party, to pay to Presmar Associates 5% of the cash proceeds from such sale transaction. Any future sale of the Poly-Vi-Flor® trademark to a third party would require that 5% of the sale proceeds be paid to Presmar Associates. Payments are made by TRx in arrears on a quarterly basis within 45 days after the end of a given calendar quarter.
Millipred and Veripred Related Contracts
Marketing Agreement between Pharmaceutical Associates, Inc. (“PAI”), and TRx and TRx Corp., effective April 1, 2017
TRx entered into a Marketing Agreement with PAI, effective April 1, 2017. Under the agreement, TRx will promote, market and sell PSP 10 and PSP 20 on behalf of PAI. TRx agrees to maintain the size of its current sales force, 16 salespersons, to perform the services under the agreement. Assuming a salesforce of 16 salespeople, PAI will pay a monthly fee of $62,500 to TRx. PAI and TRx also agree to share the net revenues from sales of the products, after reimbursing certain expenditures, in a manner designed to achieve a 50/50 split of net revenues above the “break even” point, calculated in accordance with the terms and inputs set forth in the agreement. The revenue sharing continues for a period of six months after termination of the agreement, unless the agreement is terminated due to a breach. The agreement has an initial six-month term, which automatically renews for additional six-month terms, unless terminated. Either party may terminate at any time with 90 days’ written notice. 
License and Supply Agreement, dated May 19, 2008, by and between TRx and Watson Laboratories, Inc., as amended
TRx entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Watson Laboratories, Inc. on May 19, 2008, and the parties subsequently entered into amendments of the agreement on July 19, 2013 and April 1, 2016. Pursuant to the most recent amendment, the term of the agreement was extended for an additional five-year period expiring on April 1, 2021. However, TRx has the option to terminate the agreement following the first commercial sale of a generic product. If neither party terminates the agreement prior to April 1, 2021, then the agreement will automatically renew for successive one year periods. The April 1, 2016 amendment terminated the royalty provisions and instead provides that the company make license payments of $75,000 in February and August of each year through April 2021.

Ulesfia® Related Contracts
First Amended and Restated Exclusive Ulesfia Distribution Agreement, dated December 18, 2015, by and between TRx and Lachlan Pharmaceuticals (“Lachlan”)
TRx entered into the First Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Lachlan, effective December 18, 2015. The agreement amends, restates and supersedes all previous agreements between the parties with respect to the Ulesfia® (benzyl alcohol) lotion 5%. Pursuant to the agreement, Lachlan named TRx as its exclusive distributor of Ulesfia in the U.S. and agreed to supply Ulesfia® to TRx exclusively for marketing and sale in the U.S. The agreement provides that all trademark rights used in connection with Ulesfia® will remain the intellectual property of Lachlan, and all goodwill associated with the use of the trademarks for the marketing and sale of Ulesfia® in the territory will inure to the sole benefit of Lachlan. The agreement provides that TRx will retain all trademarks it develops for the distribution and commercialization of Ulesfia®, including promotional and educational materials. The agreement term continues through the end of the “Exclusivity Period”, defined as any period where (i) there exists an issued and unexpired patent right for the product in the United States, or (ii) no generic version of the product is being sold in the United States. The agreement can be terminated by TRx upon the introduction of a generic product in the territory or upon the expiration or invalidity of all patent rights for the product in the territory. Forty days prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter TRx is required to provide written forecasts of its expected Ulesfia® purchases for each of the five subsequent calendar quarters. The first two calendar quarters of each such forecast will constitute a binding purchase obligation of TRx. The remaining three calendar quarters are non-binding. The agreement also requires that TRx make a royalty payment to Lachlan in the amount of 15% of net sales so long as net sales remain below $50 million annually. For annual net sales above $50 million, TRx will owe Lachlan a royalty payment of 20% of net sales, and for annual net sales over $100 million, TRx will owe Lachlan a royalty payment of 25% of net sales. Additionally, in the event TRx’s annual net sales of the product are less than $20 million, other than as a result of a “Market Change,” TRx shall pay Lachlan an amount sufficient to make total product payments equal to the amount that would have been paid if the net sales had been equal to $20 million. The practical effect of this provision is that there is a minimum annual royalty payment of $3,000,000. TRx has asserted that a “Market Change” has occurred pursuant to the terms of this agreement and litigation is pending with respect to that assertion). There are also certain milestone payments which become payable upon the achievement of certain cumulative net sales milestones. Upon the achievement of cumulative net sales amounting to $90,000,000; $180,000,000; $270,000,000; and $400,000,000, TRx will owe Lachlan payments of $3,000,000; $3,500,000; $4,000,000; and $5,000,000, respectively.  TRx is obligated to purchase a minimum of 20,000 units per year, or approximately $1,177,000 worth of product; however, the minimum purchase requirements are void upon the earliest of: (i) Lachlan’s failure to fulfill TRx’s purchase orders for two consecutive quarters or any three quarters in a 12-month period; (ii) the first commercial sale of a generic version of the product, or (iii) termination of the agreement. The purchase price for fully packaged product is the greater of a contractually agree upon price (subject to de minimis annual increases) or 20% of the prior year’s net sales divided by the number of units sold in the prior year. The agreement includes provisions for retroactively adjusting the purchase price for the previous year if the price determined at the end of the year differs from what was actually paid. If Lachlan launches a generic product during the term, TRx will have a right of first refusal to act as the exclusive distributor for such product. TRx will have 30 days’ notice before the launch of the product to negotiate the terms of an agreement with Lachlan. Lachlan entered into a First Amended and Restated Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Concordia on January 1, 2014, and the agreement is substantively similar to the First Amended and Restated Exclusive Distribution Agreement between Lachlan and TRx discussed above (with the exception of the parties thereto, the agreements are substantially identical.
On December 10, 2016, Zylera informed Lachlan that a market change had occurred due to the introduction of Arbor Pharmaceutical’s lice product, Sklice®. According to the terms of the distribution agreement if there is a market change, the minimum purchase obligation is void. On June 5, 2017, Lachlan and Zylera entered into joint legal representation along with other unrelated third parties in negotiation and arbitration of dispute with Summers Laboratory, Inc regarding the ongoing arbitration proceeding with the ultimate recipient of the royalties over whether a Market Change has occurred. The Company has not made any payments to Lachlan in 2017 under the Lachlan Agreement (from the acquisition date through year-end).
Avadel Pharmaceuticals
In February 2018, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Avadel US Holdings, Inc. (“Avadel”) to purchase and acquire all rights in Avadel's pediatric products for a nominal cash payment for the acquired assets, and an assumption of certain of Avadel’s financial obligations to Deerfield CSF, LLC, which include a $15 million loan due in January 2021 and certain royalty obligations through February 2026. 
11

In connection with closing the Purchase Agreement, we entered into a licensing and development agreement with Flamel Ireland Limited (“Avadel Ireland”), a subsidiary of Avadel (the “Development Agreement”), under which Avadel Ireland will develop and provide us with four stable product formulations utilizing its proprietary LiquiTime® and Micropump® technology. We will reimburse Avadel Ireland for any costs associated with the development of these products in excess of $1.0 million in the aggregate. Upon transfer of the product formulations, we will assume all remaining development and regulatory costs. Once approved and marketed, we will pay Avadel Ireland royalties on net sales of such products.
Sales and Marketing

In November 2017, we purchased TRx which included a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure in pediatric health care with plans to build a premier pediatric sales and marketing team in the United States. We promote Poly-Vi-Flor®, Tri-Vi-Flor®, Millipred®, Veripred®, Ulesfia®, Cefaclor®, Karbinal®, Aciphex Sprinkles™ and Flexichamber® through a highly skilled sales force of 30 representatives and four Territory Managers. Our team is comprised of a complete support staff internally and we also partner with numerous world class vendors to increase our effectiveness and efficiency.
     As pediatric specialists, our reach and frequency with key physicians and pharmacies is data driven to maximize our coverage of these important healthcare professionals. Our primary goal is to make a positive difference in the lives of pediatric patients across the country. With established commercial operations, Cerecor is poised to be both flexible and scalable based on opportunities within the market.
Because our drug candidates are still in preclinical or early clinical development, we intend to selectively retain commercialization or co‑commercialization rights in the United States for CERC‑301, CERC-611 and certain indications of our COMTi platform, which we may complement with co‑promotion agreements with partners. For those product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, we will evaluate expanding our sales force into other specialty markets. We may also collaborate with third parties to market the approved product candidates in the United States. We may also seek to commercialize any of our approved products outside of the United States, although we only plan to do so with one or more collaborators.
Competition
We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. We compete, or will compete, with existing and new products being developed by our competitors. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our research and development programs target. Even if we and our potential collaborators are successful in developing our product candidates, the resulting products would compete with a variety of established drugs in the areas of depression, bipolar depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, substance use disorders and pain and impulse control disorders, or ICDs.
There are several generic prednisolone and prednisone preparations available in the market. However, these preparations have a very bitter taste and are of different strengths. Millipred® and Veripred® OS are the only two oral solutions that utilize the proprietary double taste-masking technology to provide a pleasant grape taste with no bitterness. Parents typically prefer Millipred and Veripred OS to other products as it is easier to administer to their children, thereby increasing treatment compliance.
The main competitor for Millipred® and Veripred® OS is Mission Pharmacal Company’s branded prednisolone, which has the same active ingredient, but at a higher concentration (25mg/5ml). Ballentyne believes the current market leader in oral solids (where TRx competes with its Millipred tablet) is Concordia Healthcare’s Ovapred ODT.
CERC‑301
CERC‑301 will compete with other drugs used as therapies for the treatment of nOH. Medication management of nOH is added when patients have persistent symptoms despite these non-pharmacological approaches. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that acts to retain sodium and water. Midodrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that can increase blood pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance. Pyridostigmine has also been used to treat nOH. Pyridostigmine is a peripheral inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, which can cause a mild increase in standing blood pressure without significantly increasing supine blood pressure. Droxidopa (L-threo-3-4-dihydroxyphenylserine [L-threo DOPS]), an oral prodrug converted by decarboxylation to NE in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems.
CERC-611
12

The epilepsy market is crowded with current therapies targeting a variety of mechanisms, including GABA receptor agonism, T-type calcium channel blockers, sodium channel modulators, synaptic vesicle protein SV2A modulation, and inhibition of GABA transaminase. More recently, a new class of AMPA receptor antagonists have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy.
CERC-611, if we are successful in developing it and it gains regulatory approval, would compete with a number of branded and generic AEDs. A few major pharmaceutical companies (GSK (Lamictal/XR), Pfizer (Lyrica)) and specialty players (UCB (Vimpat, Keppra), Lundbeck (Sabril) and Supernus (Trokendi XR)) dominate the anti-epilepsy drug therapy market. New market entrants such as Sage Pharmaceuticals and GW Pharmaceuticals are targeting difficult to treat orphan patient populations such as super-refractory status epilepticus and Dravet Syndrome, respectively. To our knowledge, there are no other TARP γ-8-dependent AMPA receptor antagonist s in development other than CERC-611.
CERC‑406 / CERC-425
There are no approved pharmacologic treatments for cognitive impairment associated in the U.S. at this time. In March 2015, vortioxetine (Brintellix®), marketed in the United States by Lundbeck Pharmaceuticals, which was originally developed and commercialized for the treatment of MDD, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency to expand the label to include information for cognitive function in patients with depression. A supplemental application for the addition of clinical data to the FDA approved product label for Brintellix was not approved by the FDA.
COMT Inhibitor Platform

Our potential products for the treatment of the cognitive and motoric impairment of Parkinson’s disease may compete with existing COMT inhibitors Comtan (entacapone), marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., or Novartis, (licensed from Orion), Tasmar (tolcapone), marketed by Valeant, and Stalevo (fixed combinations of entacapone and levodopa/carbidopa), also marketed by Novartis (licensed from Orion). Comtan, Tasmar, and Stalevo are all generic in the United States. Currently, no treatments are approved for cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease.
Overall Competitive Climate and Risks
In addition, the companies described above and other competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or may be awaiting FDA approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small compound drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:

• | identifying and validating targets;


• | screening compounds against targets;


• | preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and


• | obtaining FDA and other regulatory clearances.

In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:

• | capital resources;


• | research and development resources;


• | manufacturing capabilities; and


• | sales and marketing.

Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, may succeed in developing technologies or drugs that are more effective, safer, and more affordable or more easily administered than ours and may achieve patent protection or commercialize drugs sooner than us. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
13

For additional information on risks regarding our competition, refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export, pricing, and government contracting related to pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, or other actions, such as the FDA’s delay in review of or refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or study termination, issuance of Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, mandated modifications to promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, requests for product recalls, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow product import or export, total or partial suspension of or restriction of or imposition of other requirements relating to production or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by local or central independent institutional review boards, or IRB, before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine GCP compliance; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Additionally, if a drug is considered a controlled substance, prior to the commencement of marketing, the DEA must also determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, among other things, the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. The FDA may raise concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and place the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
14

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and review and approval by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, a central IRB or local IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial, including any changes, while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered through well‑controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk‑benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to GMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as United States export requirements under the FDCA.
Progress reports and other summary information detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if certain serious adverse events occur or other significant safety information is found. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements or the protocol. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. A waiver from the application user fee may be sought by an applicant. One basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have a drug product that has been approved under a human drug application and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first human drug application. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. The FDA aims to review 90% of all standard review applications within ten months of acceptance for filing and six months of acceptance for filing for priority review applications.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and 
15

administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, either during the application process or after the approval of the drug to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Under the FDCA, before approving a drug for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that drug to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the drug to an advisory committee. The external advisory committee review may also be required for other drugs because of certain other issues, including clinical trial design, safety and effectiveness, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP regulations.
The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.

After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has a review goal of completing its review of 90% of resubmissions within two or six months after receipt, depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black boxed warning, require that post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, certain circumstances may require FDA notification, review, or approval, as well as further testing. These may include some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, or new safety information
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
16

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If fast track designation is obtained, drug sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application in six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. These six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life‑threatening illnesses or conditions and that fill an unmet medical need may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post‑marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for the fast track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross‑disciplinary review.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post‑Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, manufacturing, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post‑approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the 
17

FDA. These facilities are further subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with GMP and other regulatory requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and may require prior approval by the FDA or notification to the FDA before or after being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product becomes available in the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | fines, Warning Letters or Untitled Letters, holds or termination of post‑approval clinical trials or FDA debarment;


• | delay or refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;


• | regulatory authority, including the FDA, issued safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such products;


• | mandated modifications to promotional material or issuance of corrective information;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including imprisonment, disgorgement and restitution, as well as consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, deferred prosecution agreements and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside of the approved indications in the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly marketed or promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs debarment from government contracts and refusal of future orders under existing contracts, and mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding drug products. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufactures will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products such that they would result in serious adverse health consequences or death, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
DEA Regulation
While we currently do not know whether any of our product candidates will be considered to be controlled substances, we will be required to evaluate the abuse potential of our product candidates. If any of our product candidates are considered controlled substances, we will need to comply with additional regulatory requirements.
18

Certain drug products may be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration’s, or DEA’s, implementing regulations. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. FDA provides a recommendation to DEA as to whether a drug should be classified as a controlled substance and the appropriate level of control. If DEA scheduling is required, a drug product may not be marketed until the scheduling process is completed, which could delay the launch of the product.
Depending on the Schedule, drug products may be subject to registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation, inventory, quota and other requirements administered by the DEA, which are directly applicable to product applicants, contract manufacturers and to distributors, prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.
Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration and on a periodic basis. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports may be required to made to the DEA for the distribution of certain controlled substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or significant losses of any controlled substance. To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings or consent decrees. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances.
Federal and State Healthcare related, Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse, and other laws regulations, and requirements restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti‑kickback and false claims laws and regulations, state and federal transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care professionals, as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations and other requirements applicable to the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical manufacturers. There are also laws, regulations, and requirements applicable to the award and performance of federal contracts and grants.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain provisions of the criminal health care fraud statute (discussed below) such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may 
19

assert that a claim for payment for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties and damages, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. Conviction or civil judgments are also grounds for debarment from government contracts.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, including payments under a federal grant. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Companies have also been sued for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, or off‑label, uses. In addition, federal health care programs require drug manufacturers to report drug pricing information, which is used to quantify discounts and establish reimbursement rates. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been sued for reporting allegedly false pricing information, which caused the manufacturer to understate rebates owed or, when used to determine reimbursement rates, caused overpayment to providers. Violations of the civil False Claims Act may result in civil penalties and damages as well as exclusion from federal healthcare programs and corporate integrity agreements or deferred prosecution agreements. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. Violations of the criminal False Claims Act can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Conviction or civil judgments and other conduct are also grounds for debarment from government contracts and grants.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As discussed above, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain of HIPAA’s healthcare fraud provisions such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of HIPAA’s fraud and abuse provisions may result in fines or imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, depending on the conduct in question. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The Veterans Health Care Act requires manufacturers of covered drugs to offer them for sale on the Federal Supply Schedule, which requires compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The Affordable Care Act created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. Certain states also require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or the provision of other items of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; impose restrictions on marketing practices; and/or require drug manufacturers to track and report information related to payments, gifts and other items of value to physicians and other healthcare providers.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of 
20

individually identifiable health information. Penalties for violating HIPAA include civil penalties, criminal penalties and imprisonment. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws govern the privacy and security of health and other information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third‑party payers provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our therapeutic product candidates. In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third‑party payers are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage, attempting to limit reimbursement levels or regulate the price of drugs and other medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. For example, in the United States, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. Federal programs also impose price controls through mandatory ceiling prices on purchases by federal agencies and federally funded hospitals and clinics and mandatory rebates on retail pharmacy prescriptions paid by Medicaid and Tricare. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. Moreover, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and other governmental payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies.
In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, competition within therapeutic classes, availability of generic equivalents, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. The cost containment measures that healthcare payers and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third‑party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription, pharmacy drugs pursuant to federal regulations. Part D plans include both standalone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy 
21

and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payers.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third‑party payers do not consider our product candidates to be cost‑effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, most recently, the Affordable Care Act, which became law in March 2010 and substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Affordable Care Act establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; expansion of Medicaid benefits and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; and expansion of the 340B drug discount program that mandates discounts to certain hospitals, community centers and other qualifying providers. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the United States healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates once they are approved.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Hatch‑Waxman Patent Exclusivity
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. 505(b)(2) NDAs generally are submitted for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is required to provide a certification to the FDA in the product application concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

• | the required patent information has not been filed;

22


• | the listed patent has expired;


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new product.

Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except when the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent or if the listed patent is a patented method of use for which approval is not being sought. A certification that the proposed product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or does not indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of notice of the Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant or other period determined by a court.
Hatch‑Waxman Non‑Patent Exclusivity
Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three‑year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent exclusivity period described above. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application owing to regulatory exclusivity or listed patents.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from United States sales. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user‑fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same 
23

drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. While we have not sought to obtain orphan drug designation for any of our products, we may in the future seek such designation if we determine that the relevant criteria are met.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union Drug Approval Process
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAAs, either under the so‑called centralized or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency or EMA that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop‑clocks.
National authorization procedures
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten‑year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the 
24

marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 38 full‑time employees, six of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and two of whom had a Ph.D. degree, 26 were engaged in commercialization activities. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
