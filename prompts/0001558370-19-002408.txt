     ITEM 1. BUSINESS
     Founded in 1989, we are a global merchant acquirer and payment processor servicing more than 550,000 merchants in North America and Europe and processing more than 950 million transactions in North America and 2.1 billion transactions in Europe annually. We operate at the center of global electronic commerce with local operations in 11 countries and the ability to serve 50 markets around the world through our three proprietary, in-house processing platforms that are connected by a single point of integration. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through (1) a highly productive and scaled sales distribution network, including exclusive global financial institution referral partnerships, (2) our three proprietary, in-house processing platforms, and (3) a comprehensive suite of payment and commerce solutions. We believe these points of differentiation allow us to deliver strong organic growth, increase market share, and attract additional financial institution, technology and other strategic partner relationships.
 Our business, both domestically and abroad, is supported by partnerships with independent software vendors (“ISVs”), integrated software dealers, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) software dealers and eCommerce gateway providers which we refer to as our “Tech-enabled” division. These partnerships function by way of a technical integration between us and the third party in which the third party seamlessly passes information to our systems to streamline the merchant boarding process. We have emerged as a preferred partner for these third-party referral partners because of the ease of integration through our proprietary solutions, high merchant satisfaction levels driven by the quality of our service, the ease and speed of our boarding systems for new merchants, and our consistent and transparent approach to risk and underwriting.
 Our business is also supported by our “Direct” division, which includes our referral relationships with fourteen leading financial institutions, many of which are long-term and on an exclusive basis. In the aggregate, these banks represent more than 12,000 branch locations which actively pursue new merchant relationships on our behalf every day. These financial institutions provide us with access to their brands, significantly enhancing our credibility and recognition. We build and maintain a direct relationship with our merchants in order to control our sales, price negotiation, underwriting, boarding and support processes. Our Direct division also includes our extensive direct sales capabilities and relationships. Finally, our “Traditional” division is our heritage U.S. portfolio composed primarily of independent sales organization (“ISO”) relationships.
 We are focused on delivering products and services that provide the most value and convenience to our merchants. Our payment and commerce solutions consist of our own products as well as services that we enable through technical integrations with third-party providers. Our value-added solutions include gateway solutions, online fraud prevention and management reporting, online hosted payments page capabilities, security tokenization and encryption solutions at the point-of-sale (“POS”) and online, dynamic currency conversion (“DCC”), loyalty offers and other ancillary solutions. We offer processing capabilities tailored to specific industries and provide merchants with recurring billing, multi-currency authorization and settlement, and cross-border processing. Our global footprint and ease of integration consistently attract new partner relationships, allowing us to develop a robust integrated solutions partner network and uniquely positioning us to stay ahead of major trends in each of our markets.
 We operate three proprietary, in-house processing platforms, all connected via our EVO Snap solution and each supporting a different geographic region. EVO Snap provides a technical connection to our regional processing systems and a central point of integration for all third-party product partners. Importantly, our platforms allow us to address the specific needs of specific payment markets and to control the entire customer experience. In-house processing also allows us to directly address merchant and regulatory concerns regarding the flow of cardholder data and other sensitive information. Our systems also provide scale efficiencies which minimize our variable costs as merchant counts and transaction volumes increase.

 Organizational structure and corporate information
 EVO, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 20, 2017. On May 25, 2018, we completed an initial public offering of 16,100,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share, of which 15,433,333 shares were sold by us and 666,667 shares were sold by one of our stockholders (the “IPO”). The shares began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market system (“Nasdaq”) on May 23, 2018 under the symbol “EVOP.” In connection with the IPO, we completed the Reorganization Transactions to implement an “Up-C” capital structure. As a result of the Reorganization Transactions and the IPO, EVO, Inc. is the sole managing member of EVO, LLC and a holding company whose principal asset is the LLC Interests. 
 On September 20, 2018, we completed a secondary offering of an aggregate 8,075,558 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $24.50 per share (the “Secondary Offering”). The Secondary Offering consisted of 7,000,000 shares of Class A common stock offered and sold by us, with the net proceeds used to purchase an equivalent number of LLC Interests and shares of Class D common stock (which shares were then canceled) from affiliates of MDP, and 22,225 shares of Class A common stock offered and sold by certain individual selling stockholders.  We also offered and sold 1,053,333 shares of Class A common stock as part of an option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in the Secondary Offering.

We maintain a website with the address www.evopayments.com. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available, free of charge through our website, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our annual proxy statements, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
 Our competitive strengths
 Global footprint enables us to serve clients around the world
 We have operations in 11 countries and the ability to service merchants in 50 markets around the world. Our customers include large national and multi-national corporations as well as small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) spanning across most industry verticals. Our global merchant footprint is diversified among retail, restaurants, petroleum, government, transit and telecom industries, among others.
 We have established sales channels and relationships in large developed economies, such as the United States, Canada and Western Europe, where the penetration of electronic payments is high. In addition, we have investments and partnerships in fast-growing developing and emerging markets with lower penetration rates of electronic payments, such as Mexico and Eastern Europe. 
 We believe our global footprint is a significant competitive advantage as we compete for large, multi-national clients as well as ISVs, integrated software and ERP dealers, and other partners. Large, multi-national merchants choose us because we can act as a single acquirer and processor in the markets in which they operate. Additionally, because of our global footprint, our referral partners can reach new markets by leveraging their connection with us to access our global processing services.
 Due to our broad distribution, diversified product offering, market leading integrated solutions and outstanding client service, we have built “sticky” relationships with our merchants and referral partners. These merchants rely on our “one stop” product offerings, including our payment processing, on-boarding, underwriting, technical support, secure infrastructure and settlement services, and our technology is often heavily embedded in our merchants’ infrastructure. Due to these factors, it is costly and disruptive for our merchants to terminate our products and services and switch their entire payment system to another provider. 
 Strategic distribution partnerships with financial institutions and Tech-enabled referral partners
 Across Europe and Mexico, our exclusive financial institution distribution relationships represent more than 12,000 bank branches, including retail and corporate banking locations. We are highly selective in identifying optimal distribution 

 
  7

 
partners and we seek to align ourselves with financial institutions that have strong networks, a high-quality client portfolio and a trusted brand name. After forming these relationships, we introduce our sales and technology capabilities to the local market, identify new merchant recruitment opportunities and strengthen our relationships with existing merchant clients. We have experienced significant success in all of our financial institution alliances in attracting new customers on behalf of our bank partners. We frequently leverage our financial institutional partners’ brands to provide higher quality services to merchants, thus strengthening the goodwill between our partners and their merchants. We have demonstrated success in integrating and cross-selling our services to this expanded merchant base as well as generating new banking customers for our partners through our direct sales strategies.
 We have also established deep relationships with a large network of Tech-enabled referral partners including ISVs, integrated software dealers, eCommerce providers and other membership or distribution partners that wish to offer payment processing services to their merchant customers. We believe our expertise in serving Tech-enabled referral partners is differentiated and enabled by our three proprietary, in-house processing platforms and service-oriented culture. Through a single, easy integration point, partners gain access to our global processing platform and solutions. Furthermore, our commitment to customer service drives high merchant satisfaction levels and has established our strong reputation as a reliable and trusted partner around the world. We believe our expertise in serving Tech-enabled distribution partners is a competitive advantage and will position us for continued growth.
 Comprehensive suite of payment and commerce solutions
 We are focused on delivering the products and services that provide optimal value and convenience to our merchants. As such, we continuously survey the competitive landscape and our merchants and leverage our experience in markets throughout the world to develop products, services, pricing, promotions and partnering strategies for each region that we believe best suits the current and future needs of each market. Our wide-ranging experience serving multi-national merchants in markets around the world, as well as our close relationships with large merchants and various card networks, including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, UnionPay and other card networks, uniquely position us to stay ahead of major trends in each of our markets.
 We intend to maximize the number of merchants we serve in each of the markets in which we operate. To accomplish this objective, we offer a broad portfolio of products, services and pricing solutions with functionality that appeals to a broad range of merchants and that are specifically designed for particular vertical markets. Our extensive product offerings enable us to provide multiple solutions to each of our merchants, allowing our merchants to tailor our offerings to their needs.
 In addition, because we operate in markets around the world and have a global perspective, we are able to export best-in-class strategies and solutions from one market into another. Specifically, EVO Snap provides a technical connection to our proprietary processing systems and a single point of integration for technology partners and merchants across all our markets and geographies. We believe this capability differentiates us from our competitors.
 Best-in-class technology and security
 Our processing platforms are supported by full back office security and monitoring infrastructures. Our EVO Snap product line is focused on providing a collection of integrated solution offerings, which allow integrated partners to connect to our systems via a simple, single integration, giving them access to our platforms. This product line includes (1) a proprietary eCommerce marketplace solution that allows online merchants to leverage our global suite of products, including paperless reporting and boarding, (2) an ISV platform that offers merchants a variety of direct connections to software companies through various integrated software dealers, and (3) a full eCommerce gateway solution that provides a comprehensive payments solution.
 Our EVO Snap platform is fully EMV compliant and provides an extensive menu of advanced features to our current and prospective integrated software partners, including tokenization, point-to-point encryption and real-time fraud scoring. We believe this platform also allows us to deliver outsized value to our merchants by providing them with access to a broad range of industry-specific business management software tools at the POS (e.g., inventory management, advanced accounting functions and real-time promotions), even if the software vendor that created the tool is located across the

globe. Without EVO Snap, a merchant would have to hire a third party to develop and maintain the software necessary to integrate the merchant’s POS system with a merchant acquirer in order to accept card payments.
 Uninterrupted services are mission-critical to our merchants and bank partners. As such, we have invested in creating a world-class technology infrastructure designed to prioritize both efficiency and security. In addition, everything we bring to market is designed and implemented with security as a primary requirement. Our technology infrastructure is supported by professionals with decades of experience in operating high-volume, real-time processing systems and has been developed around state-of-the-art data centers located in North America and Europe. We have also designed our environments with the ability to redirect processing to the most appropriate operating location at any given time. This flexibility enables us to continue to offer processing services during catastrophic events and disasters that would otherwise adversely affect our clients.
 In addition, we have implemented a formal program, EVO Secure, to address threats to our infrastructure. This multi-layered program, led by a team of dedicated security professionals, ensures that we evaluate, protect against, monitor and react to potential threats in a consistent manner across our global network.
 Proven management team with strong track record of value-creating acquisitions
 Our senior leadership team includes highly experienced payment technology professionals based in the United States and Europe, allowing us to operate successfully both domestically and internationally. Many of our executives have previously worked together in the industry, and have extensive experience in developing and managing a global payments company. As we have expanded our international operations, we have invested substantial resources to attract and retain experienced talent with significant in-country experience to further develop and support our current markets and enter new ones.
 Our senior leadership team has also demonstrated exceptional execution capabilities around developing new markets and sales distribution channels, consolidating and insourcing operations, and leading multi-cultural dispersed teams. They have completed eight platform migrations resulting in over 360,000 merchants being migrated to our proprietary platforms. The team has also successfully structured and maintained complex alliance relationships with many large financial institutions, which provide a significant number of merchant referrals to our business.
 Our growth strategies
 We believe our competitive strengths will continue to generate significant growth opportunities in both existing and new markets. We plan to grow our business and improve our operations by executing the following strategies:
 Organically growing existing markets
 We believe there is considerable opportunity for growth not only in new markets, but in our existing markets as well. Since 2012, our international operations have grown considerably, accounting for approximately 65% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Many of our international markets are less mature than the U.S. with respect to the growth drivers of our business. Specifically, these markets exhibit higher overall consumer expenditure growth, provide more opportunity for cash-to-card conversion, offer more penetration of integrated and eCommerce solutions and present upside growth opportunities with new financial institution partners.
 We believe there is significant growth potential in the U.S. and Canada due to market share shifts stemming from technological advancements in the electronic payments industry. We are focused on integrated payments, business-to-business and eCommerce solutions, all of which currently comprise a significant portion of our business. These solutions currently have a growth rate that is superior to that of traditional POS systems, and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.

 To continue growing our merchant base we focus primarily on the following strategies:

· | Supporting our existing portfolio and adding new customers. Our existing distribution partners currently service merchants that do not utilize our services, which presents new business opportunities within these existing relationships. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Introducing our comprehensive, global set of payment and commerce solutions to our existing markets. With industry leading products and services, such as our proprietary DCC technology, our state-of-the-art integrated platform and our eCommerce gateway solution, we believe we are uniquely positioned to enable our distribution partners to offer their merchants the broadest product offering in the market. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging our global infrastructure to ensure efficiency and competitiveness. As a result of having a single proprietary integrated platform, we are able to efficiently manage, update and maintain our technology, increase capacity and speed, and realize significant operating leverage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customizing solutions to meet in-market needs. We design our products and services to meet the needs of our local customer base and partners. We also enable our systems to utilize local alternative payment mechanisms that are present in particular markets, such as Blik in Poland and Paydirekt in Germany. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By implementing these strategies, we believe we will increase adoption of our payment and commerce solutions, continue to grow our merchant base and offer merchants the broadest set of solutions in the market.
 Expanding our global footprint
 Our partnership strategy has been a source of significant growth, and we believe it will continue to facilitate growth in the future. Since 2012, we have established fourteen exclusive bank partnerships in ten countries. While we have made meaningful headway in penetrating new markets, we believe considerable opportunities remain in both establishing additional partnerships in our current markets, as well as entirely new markets around the world.
 In determining which markets to enter, we evaluate a wide range of factors, including the reputation of our potential bank partner, the size of the domestic economy, card usage penetration, growth prospects, profitability, commerce and technology trends, regulatory and other risks, required investments, management resources and the likely return on investment. This strategy drives us to expand into select international markets that we believe present attractive investment opportunities for long-term, sustainable merchant growth, as supported by factors such as:

· | low penetration of cards-per capita among consumers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | high volume growth supported by cash-to-card conversion;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | regulatory initiatives implemented with an aim to accelerate card acceptance among merchants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | less differentiated competitive landscape, given the prevalence of bank-owned acquiring businesses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increased adoption of integrated point-of-sale, eCommerce and integrated technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | embedded distribution through partner retail and corporate branch footprint; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to launch our product suite and customer-centric services to accelerate end-market growth and acceptance penetration.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We generally enter new markets by creating distribution partnerships with leading financial institutions that possess a high degree of market knowledge, brand recognition and large distribution networks. These distribution partnerships enable us to access a diverse group of merchants and expand the reach of our products and services.

 Broadening our distribution network
 We aim to grow our business and broaden our global reach by generating new distribution relationships that add merchants to our portfolio. We reach new merchants primarily through our direct sales force and referral relationships. Our focus is to build these relationships across all channels, including financial institutions, software vendors, POS dealers, gateway providers and agents. In addition to developing these growth channels, we are able to leverage our infrastructure both in servicing our existing markets and in expanding to new markets. For example, we have introduced EVO Snap into our European operations, extending our ability for merchants to tap into EVO Snap as a single, global integration platform. We also have the ability to support U.S.-based integrated software dealers and distributors as they enter new markets. We plan to continue to broaden our distribution network by identifying and securing new distribution opportunities within both our existing markets and future markets.
 Growing and enhancing our innovative payments and commerce solutions
 We believe our innovative payments and commerce solutions represent one of our competitive advantages. Through strategic acquisitions and internal development, we have made significant investments in both technology and personnel to propel our product innovation forward. In order to continue to expand, we believe we must continue to offer our customers state-of-the-art products and services. Through a combination of building products organically, partnering with leading technology innovators and selectively pursuing acquisitions, we are constantly driving innovation to enhance our products and services.
 Through acquisitions and internal development, we have invested heavily in supporting a diverse network of integrated POS providers, ISVs, and integrated software and ERP dealers. These investments have strengthened our ability to support the software community in the markets where we operate, including POS, mobile and eCommerce developers, by providing these developers with the tools necessary to develop a broader suite of multi-channel, multi-service solutions for merchants. This distribution-centric strategy has created our key, global technology solution, in which software developers can integrate to our proprietary processing platforms and we can sign up Tech-enabled solutions providers as strategic distribution partners.
 Capitalizing on our operating leverage
 Our focus on cost optimization is a part of our culture that allows us to pursue other growth strategies. The deep industry and operating expertise of our management team enables us to identify opportunities to improve the operating efficiencies of our technology, product and operations infrastructure. With in-house processing solutions and proprietary internal systems in North America and Europe, we have significant operating leverage as we grow overall volumes and transactions. With each newly acquired business, we utilize this infrastructure to optimize costs and efficiencies. Through the support and reporting capabilities of our global systems, we eliminate redundancies and improve operating efficiencies post-acquisition.
 Our sales and distribution network
 We have developed a network of highly successful sales distribution channels to drive growth of our merchant portfolio. A central component of our growth strategy is our strategic investment in new products and distribution channels and the seamless introduction of these assets to our global markets.  These proven sales distribution networks consist of our Tech-enabled division, which includes our integrated, business-to-business and eCommerce businesses, as well as our Direct and Traditional divisions.
 Through our diverse channels, we target merchants across a wide variety of industries and sizes. Our network of over 1,500 integrated partnerships allows us to target SME merchants who desire an integrated software solution for their physical locations. We also target larger business-to-business merchants with our differentiated product offerings. Our Tech-enabled division represents approximately 33% of our North America revenue. In Europe, our Tech-enabled division represents approximately 33% of segment revenue as of December 31, 2018.

 
  11

 

 In our direct sales business, we target SME merchants via referrals from our financial institution and other partners. We are also able to utilize our direct sales force to target these merchants. We also target large merchants through a coordinated sales approach with our financial institution partners. Our direct sales business is our largest channel as the Mexico and Europe markets are dominated by referrals from our financial institution partners. This business represents approximately 60% of our total revenue in North America and 67% in Europe as of December 31, 2018.
 Tech-enabled
 Our business, both domestically and abroad, is supported by partnerships with ISVs, integrated software dealers, ERP software dealers and eCommerce gateway providers, which we refer to as our “Tech-enabled” division. These partnerships function by way of a technical integration between us and the third party in which the third party seamlessly passes information to our systems to streamline the merchant boarding process. 
 Over the past several years, we have invested in an infrastructure that allows integrated software providers to offer multiple integrated payment solutions to merchants throughout the markets we serve. For example, software developers can access a simple yet powerful connection point through our EVO Snap platform allowing them to fully leverage their integrated solutions by connecting to all of our processing platforms—thereby expanding their reach to include merchants in all of our geographic markets. Through our acquisition of Sterling Payment Technologies, LLC (“Sterling”) in 2017, we acquired a portfolio of existing integrated software merchants and hundreds of integrated software and dealer partners in the United States. 
 Our integration solutions offering also includes our business-to-business offering, which allows us to target larger merchants operating in this space. We believe that business-to-business merchants are increasingly striving to eliminate paper invoices from receivable collections.  By using our proprietary processing platforms, we can offer various interchange management and reporting solutions specially created for these larger merchants. 
 In May 2018, we acquired Nodus Technologies, Inc. (“Nodus”) which develops proprietary integrations to ERP solutions such as Microsoft AX and Microsoft Great Plains.  The Nodus acquisition enables our merchants to seamlessly integrate payment solutions into third party ERP solutions by leveraging existing Nodus technologies. In October 2018, we acquired ClearONE, S.L. (“ClearONE”), a leading POS payments platform integrated to over one hundred software solutions serving more than 10,000 merchants across Europe.
  Our domestic and multinational gateway partners refer merchants to us and often board merchants utilizing our eCommerce boarding tool. Our eCommerce business accounts for a significant portion of our U.S. business and our eCommerce tools have also been successfully deployed in our European operations. We expect this business to continue to grow as it is deployed across international markets, especially as those markets experience further penetration and growth in eCommerce transactions. We are able to deploy our proprietary eCommerce gateway solution through our various sales channels to reach a diverse base of multi-channel, integrated and eCommerce-only merchants throughout our global footprint.  
     Direct
 Our Direct division consists of our direct sales force and our financial institution partner relationships and we believe these businesses provide substantial growth opportunities. We have a long history of operating as a direct sales organization and have succeeded by aggressively pursuing customers through our direct sales efforts and retaining merchants by delivering high levels of customer satisfaction. We view our direct sales force as complementary to our financial institution relationships, as our direct sales force generates new merchant opportunities in addition to the referrals we receive from our various partners. In addition, our financial institution partners benefit from our direct sales force network, as we regularly refer new banking business to them when we successfully recruit merchants though this network. 

 
  12

 

 Our direct sale capabilities have recently proven beneficial in the support of our integration solutions channel. We offer our sales distribution channels to our Tech-enabled partners, extending their sales reach by actively recruiting merchants on their behalf as well as cross-selling their services to our customer base. As we have expanded internationally, we have exported our direct sale expertise and capabilities into Ireland, the United Kingdom and Mexico, using tools and sales practices developed in the United States.
 Our Direct division includes our bank referral relationships, through which our financial institution partners refer their merchant customers to us, often on an exclusive basis, and we provide payment processing solutions to those merchants. Since 2012, we have established partnerships with leading international financial institutions, including with Deutsche Bank USA, Deutsche Bank Group, Deutsche Postbank, Banco Popular / Grupo Santander, PKO Bank Polski, Bank of Ireland, Raiffeisen Polbank, Raiffeisen Bank, Moneta, Citibanamex, Sabadell, Liberbank, Caixa Guissona and BNP Paribas. Our pending joint venture and exclusive referral relationship with EuroBic in Portugal is expected to be completed in the summer of 2019, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.
 A key component of our Direct division is our highly customized lead management, merchant boarding and risk management software tool. This technology allows us to quickly and efficiently accept leads from sales representatives and bank partners, board merchants online and manage transaction risks.
 Traditional
 In our Traditional division, we partner with traditional, independent feet-on-the-street agents, ISOs and other partners across multiple markets both domestic and international. These partners allow us to further penetrate niche segments, verticals, geographies or selected strategic markets and broaden our merchant base without incremental investment obligations or any cannibalization of our financial institution partner relationships. While most of our relationships are commercial partnerships, in select situations we have retained an equity stake in a partner. Historically, we invested in ISOs and received controlling or non-controlling interests in the companies in exchange for a processing relationship with the ISOs. While our legacy relationships in this division are profitable, we expect this business to decline over time.
 Our products and services
 We offer a comprehensive portfolio of card-present and card-not-present payment solutions for a variety of industry types and business sizes to facilitate merchants accepting credit, debit, prepaid and other alternative payment types. Our portfolio of solutions includes EMV, chip and signature enabled POS terminals, virtual POS terminals for desktops, mobile acceptance and mobile point-of-sale, or mPOS, solutions for mobile devices and tablets, online hosted payments, and PSP for card-not-present bankcard, direct debit and alternative payment scheme processing. We also offer value-added solutions such as online fraud prevention and management solutions, online hosted payments page capabilities, gateway solutions, security tokenization and encryption solutions at the POS and online, DCC, and loyalty offers, among others. Other industry-specific processing capabilities are also in our product suite, such as recurring billing, multi-currency authorization, and cross-border processing and settlement.
 Our solutions enable merchants of all sizes to accept and settle cards, ACH, closed loop gift, pre-paid and other payment capabilities. This spectrum of solutions includes:

· | EMV chip, magnetic swipe readers, contactless, chip and signature, chip debit and gift services for hardware terminals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our mPOS solutions and services for integrators and merchants for global processing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a variety of eCommerce solutions including hosted payments, payment link, shopping cart-plug-ins and gateway/PSP products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | comprehensive real-time digital and signatureless merchant boarding systems (from application to merchant processing);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  13

 


· | market-specific business models for partners, including PSP and referral programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | online reporting systems for partners, integrators and merchants providing access to our platforms worldwide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, as a merchant acquirer, we provide in-house customer service utilizing in-market call centers, as we believe customers need to be served locally in market. We also have developed a consolidated shared services operational capability, for back-office services, including credit underwriting, risk, chargebacks, and terminal deployment and repair. Our capabilities also include a regionally based merchant boarding system, risk management and ISV technology development centers, supporting North America and Europe.
 Our diverse offerings are supported by our two unique underlying global products, EVO Snap and our proprietary customer relationship management (“CRM”) solutions. EVO Snap is a highly customized, EMV compliant technology platform that allows merchants to easily access our products in all of the markets we service with one single integration, including both core (settlement and authorization) and value-added (ACH, Level 3 processing, DCC) services in many of the markets in which we operate. Our merchants and partners benefit from a single global certification and common interface in North America and Europe, a key feature for retail and eCommerce merchants and referral partners with a global customer base. This common application programming interface (“API”) allows ISVs and developers to seamlessly integrate to EVO Snap and access all of its new features.
 Our global, state-of-the-art CRM solutions enable all merchants, whether they are recruited through our financial institutions, direct sales or partner channels, to be seamlessly managed from lead to live. We provide all partners and agents access to these tools to ensure effective digital customer lifecycle management, thus streamlining the boarding and management of customers and complementing our digital payment product and service strategy.
 Technology
 As the rate of innovation has increased dramatically, providing payment and commerce solutions to merchants of all types has become increasingly dependent upon a strong foundation of secure and flexible technology. We have designed our technology, platforms, applications and networks with a singular focus in mind—to provide the products and services our merchants want in the most secure, efficient and effective manner possible.
 Underpinning this focus is a worldwide team of professionals from multiple disciplines, dedicated to continuously improving our service levels while expanding our offerings to merchants across the various regions in which we operate.
 Systems
 Our strategy is to own and operate the technology we use wherever possible. We believe that this approach allows us to deliver the products and services that are most in demand by our merchants throughout our global footprint and differentiates us from our competitors. In many markets, we provide cutting-edge solutions that merchants are unable to obtain from other sources and we constantly seek to leverage successful products, services, platforms and applications across all of our markets—providing a consistent experience for our multinational customers.
 We believe that a key success factor for our technology is its ability to scale efficiently. This ability is built into our technology infrastructure, and we continuously monitor both our current capacity and our forecasted volumes to ensure that we maintain the ability to process peak volumes.
 Additionally, our footprint enables us to adapt to new opportunities and challenges in a manner that many of our competitors are unable to match due to their geographically limited reach. We develop local expertise in key markets and work to identify untapped or underserved opportunities as well as tailor our products and services to the unique needs of our merchants in each region.

 Platforms
 We operate three separate processing platforms located in Poland, the United States and Mexico. These three platforms are all designed with resiliency and security in mind and they are all managed locally with centralized oversight to maintain consistency of delivery. These three processing platforms share a common CRM for boarding and a common reporting infrastructure, and are all accessible in a consistent manner due to their integrations to our EVO Snap platform.
 Our infrastructure is comprised of platforms that have been validated and rigorously tested, while being based upon the most recent technologies and architectural concepts available in the marketplace. Our design engineers are focused on providing environments that our delivery organizations can rely upon to operate their applications in the most efficient and effective manner possible, and our computer operations group monitors our entire platform infrastructure from our command centers located in Europe and North America. This monitoring enables us to plan our delivery capacity efficiently and accurately, resulting in an extremely high focus on service availability levels for our customers. At any time of day or night, dedicated resources split across two continents are capable of responding to any potential issue or event—whether natural or man-made. We regularly shift processing loads between our multiple regional data centers to minimize any possibility of negatively impacting our merchants or their downstream customers—a capability that is even more critical now in the age of round-the-clock eCommerce processing.
 Applications
 We utilize a combination of proprietary and commercial applications in line with our philosophy of using technology as a key differentiator from our competitors. Many customer-facing products and services, from boarding to billing, are applications created or acquired by us, while our core processing engines are a mixture of internal and commercial applications selected for their capabilities and industrial strength. Each application undergoes rigorous review and testing—to ensure that it meets the needs of our customers while maintaining the highest standards of security and availability, and we have delivery teams distributed across our various markets that are experts in providing for the unique needs of each merchant population. This focus results in a portfolio of products and services that provides merchants across the world with the ability to accept the broad range of payment types that customers demand, along with advanced data analytics and reporting options to make managing their businesses as seamless as possible. In all cases, we look to provide the best available functionality to all of our merchants all of the time.
 We have also developed an extensive set of proprietary interfaces that enable our partners to integrate with our systems in multiple ways. Each partner can select the options that best meet their needs and capabilities.
 Networks
 We manage our own network with the help of leading telecommunication partners in each of our markets. This network enables us to provide secure communications for our merchants in whatever form they desire—whether via a dedicated phone line, a wireless connection, a cellular provider, a fixed circuit or the Internet. A critical component of this service is the fact that we provide multiple, locally-based options to all of our merchants so they can process with the confidence that they are using well-known, familiar providers in the most cost-efficient manner possible. Our proprietary encryption offerings, coupled with our diverse security options, allow us to partner with both small and large corporate merchants alike. Security
 We have developed and implemented a formal program, EVO Secure, to address threats to our infrastructure. This multi-layered program, led by a team of dedicated security professionals, ensures that we evaluate, protect against, monitor and react to potential threats in a consistent manner across our global network. We extend our security knowledge and programs to our merchants and partners to ensure a common and mutually coordinated approach to data security. We also collaborate with local, national and international law enforcement, industry experts and cyber threat specialists to leverage the most recent intelligence and best practices concerning potential threats to the financial ecosystem. EVO Secure is supported by an in-house security operations center with round-the-clock staffing that enables us to react quickly to any perceived threats to our systems, networks or data.

 Our markets
 In recent years we have significantly grown our international operations and currently operate in North America and Europe, with the ability to provide processing services to merchants in 50 markets around the world. We experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue, which can vary by region. In North America, our revenue has been strongest in our fourth quarter and weakest in our first quarter. In Europe, our revenue has been strongest in our third quarter and weakest in our first quarter.
 We classify our business into two segments: North America and Europe. The alignment of our segments is designed to establish lines of business that support the geographical markets we operate in and allow us to further globalize our solutions while working seamlessly with our teams across these markets. Both segments provide businesses with merchant acquiring solutions, including integrated solutions for retail transactions at physical business locations, as well as eCommerce and mobile transactions.
 North America
 In 2018, our North America segment, which includes our operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico, processed more than 950 million transactions. We believe the changing trends in payment technologies, including the adoption of more integrated payment solutions and the ongoing cash-to-card conversion will continue to drive growth in this market.
 Card penetration in the United States and Canada is among the highest in the world. The largest growth opportunity in these markets is arising from the shift to integrated payment solutions. This includes integrated solutions, business-to-business and eCommerce, as merchants are making an effort to enhance the payments experience for their customers. Merchant acquirers are capitalizing on this trend by entering into referral arrangements with technology companies and integrating acquiring services into their software. We have been particularly active in this market, including with the development of our EVO Snap platform, through which we provide our partners integrated solutions with a single connection point that is fully integrated with our front-end authorization systems. EVO Snap, along with other innovations in our integrated products, has been accretive to our growth in North America. In addition, the acquisition of Sterling in 2017 provided us with a significant number of new integrated relationships.
 We believe that the merchant acquiring market in Mexico represents a very attractive growth opportunity. As overall card penetration continues to increase, we believe we will enjoy outsized benefits because of our status as the only scaled independent acquirer in the market. We see significant opportunity to differentiate from our competitors, which is principally comprised of financial institutions who view acquiring as a tertiary product necessary to attract core banking business. 
 Europe
 We have significant operations throughout Europe. In 2018, we processed over 2.1 billion transactions through our offices located in Germany, Spain, Ireland, Poland, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic, as well as supporting merchants in France, Austria, Italy, the Nordics and many central and eastern European countries.
 The European merchant acquiring market has certain unique structural characteristics including self-sponsoring with the major card schemes, penetration of local debit networks, terminal-centric SME markets, pooled in-country processing with competitors and a bank-centric acquiring model, which we believe provide us with future opportunities for growth. 
 Europe’s payment infrastructure was historically built upon local debit card networks rather than the credit card based model typical of the United States. In recent years, Europe has instituted a single payments area and has enacted comprehensive interchange reform of the European cross-border pricing schedule with the two major international card networks. These changes have generally lowered the major card schemes’ domestic and cross-border interchange rates across Europe. This has incentivized local in-country debit schemes and banks to lower their rates to levels at or below these new interchange rates as a defensive move to protect their businesses. This “leveling of the playing field” across European markets encourages seamless cross-border international credit and debit acquiring. It has also caused local in-country schemes to evolve or face elimination in the face of direct competition from the two primary international card

networks. This market shift, which continues as follow-on legislation further encourages a consistent approach to payments throughout Europe, provides us with the opportunity to leverage our existing technology and product infrastructure without the burden of certifying to a myriad of local schemes. Prior to these changes, acquirers seeking to offer merchants a global acceptance model would have needed to invest significantly greater resources to certify to these in-country debit networks. While still evolving, we anticipate this developing uniformity to continue to be a positive, long-term change for the European market.
 We believe these factors, our positioning across Europe, the organic cash-to-card conversion in many markets and the opportunity to launch new products and services at the early stage of merchant adoption of market innovations such as gateway integrations and ISV solutions, provide significant opportunities for existing in-market growth coupled with future investment opportunities in adjacent countries.
 Many financial institutions across Europe entered the acquiring business decades ago by pooling their capital with their direct, in-country bank competitors to set up “captive” shared processing businesses. These businesses were generally owned by the same banks that utilized the processor services, and the processors were therefore designed to provide each of the owners/users with common card issuing and merchant acquiring processing solutions. While financially efficient and initially successful, over time this structure has caused a lack of innovation and investment in payments generally. As such, the banks find themselves with limited differentiating solutions given the evolution of their local markets and now face stiffening competition from cross-border mono-line acquirers. Our European-based platform, coupled with an array of market leading payments products, including integrated solutions for all of our operating markets, allows our partners and customers to access these solutions as part of our long-term exclusive relationships.
 We are an authorized Payments Institution (“PI”), under the European Payment Services Directive of 2007, which enables non-financial institutions to participate in the payments industry provided they can meet the regulatory requirements of the licensing jurisdiction’s regulators. We currently hold PI licenses in three markets: Germany, Poland and Spain, which enable us to operate as a direct member of the payment card networks. In some markets outside the EU, applicable regulations and the local and international networks generally require non-financial institutions similar to us to be sponsored by a bank to become an acquirer. The ability to participate in the EU payments industry with direct licenses and without the requirement for third-party sponsorship provides us with greater flexibility and control of our European business.
 Competition
 We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets are trust, brand, data security, product features and functionality, strength of financial institution partnerships, technology, price and servicing capability.
 We compete with a variety of merchant acquirers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities in the markets in which we operate. Our competitors range in both size and geographic reach. In the United States and Canada, we compete with independent merchant acquirers including First Data, Global Payments, Worldpay, TSYS and many others, in addition to financial institutions that provide acquiring and processing services on their own, including Chase Paymentech Solutions and Elavon (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp). We also face competition from ISOs that resell products of independent merchant processors, as well as earlier stage integrated software providers. In Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) and Mexico, financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment processing services to merchants, although outsourcing is becoming more prevalent. In the United Kingdom, we compete primarily with Worldpay, Barclaycard, Global Payments, First Data and Elavon.
 Our broad and differentiated product offerings, service proposition, pricing and distribution strategies in our geographically diverse markets drive our ability to compete effectively through the acceptance and use of our payment and commerce solutions by merchants. We specifically focus on the primary customer needs of speed, reliability and reconciliation, ensuring that at a minimum, our systems, solutions, products and service models are designed to put these customer expectations at the top of the priority list.

 Intellectual property
 Our products and services utilize a combination of proprietary software and hardware that we own and license from third parties. Our owned intellectual property is protected by federal patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law, as well as state trade secret laws, as appropriate. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with both our employees and third parties.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had one patent application pending related to our EVO Snap product. In addition, we own a portfolio of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including for our primary mark, EVO.
 Regulatory
 Various aspects of our service areas are subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and banking and other authorities as more fully described below. The Dodd-Frank Act
 In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act established a new, independent regulatory agency known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) to regulate consumer financial products and services. The CFPB enforces prohibitions against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the Dodd-Frank Act and may have authority over us as a provider of services to regulated financial institutions in connection with consumer financial products. Separately, under the Dodd-Frank Act, debit interchange transaction fees are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and must be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. In particular, the Federal Reserve Board has capped debit interchange rates for card issuers operating in the United States with assets of $10 billion or more at the sum of $0.21 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuer’s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuers, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that ban debit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements, prohibit card issuers and card networks from imposing transaction routing requirements and require card issuers to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card.
 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (while federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education may set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards) and to provide discounts or incentives to consumers who pay with alternative payment methods, such as cash, checks or debit cards.
 Association and network rules
 We are subject to the rules of Mastercard, Visa, INTERAC and other credit and debit networks. In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa or Mastercard as service providers for member institutions. Various subsidiaries of ours are also processor level members of numerous debit and electronic benefits transaction networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable network rules. Card networks and their member financial institutions regularly update, and generally expand, security expectations and requirements related to the security of cardholder data and environments. We are also subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association relating to payment transactions processed by us using the Automated Clearing House Network and to various state federal and foreign laws regarding such operations, including laws pertaining to electronic benefits transactions.

 Financial services regulations
 As a result of the implementation of the Payment Services Directive of 2007 in the European Union (the “EU”), a number of our subsidiaries in our European segment hold a PI license which allows them to operate in the EU member states in which such subsidiaries do business. As a PI, we are subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU member states, which includes, among other obligations, a requirement to maintain specified regulatory capital and adhere to certain rules regarding the conduct of our business. In July 2013, the European Commission proposed legislation in two parts, covering a wide range of proposed regulatory reforms affecting the payments industry across the EU. The first part was an EU-wide regulation on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions (the “Interchange Fee Regulation”). The Interchange Fee Regulation (2015/751) went into effect in June 2015. The second part consisted of a recasting of the Payment Services Directive (the “PSD2”). The European Commission’s PSD2 proposal has been considered by the two other main EU legislative institutions, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament. The PSD2 entered into force in January 2016 and replaced the current Payment Services Directive in January 2018.
 Further, several of our international subsidiaries provide services that make them subject to regulation by local banking agencies and other regulatory authorities.
 Privacy and information security regulations
 We provide services that may be subject to various state, federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations, including, among others, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the “Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act”), Directive 95/46/EC (the “Data Protection Directive”), and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada. These laws and their implementing regulations restrict certain collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for the safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. Certain federal, state and foreign laws and regulations impose similar privacy obligations and, in certain circumstances, obligations to notify affected individuals, state officers or other governmental authorities, the media and consumer reporting agencies, as well as businesses and governmental agencies, of security breaches affecting personal information. In addition, there are state and foreign laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers. In July 2016, the European Parliament adopted an EU-wide directive on security of network and information systems (the “NIS Directive”). The NIS Directive provides legal measures intended to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU and required that EU member states enact national laws to enforce certain cybersecurity obligations in 2018. 
 As a processor of personal data of EU data subjects, we are also subject to regulation and oversight in the applicable EU member states with regard to data protection legislation. The existing Data Protection Directive, contains various obligations on the processing of personal data in the EU including restrictions on transferring personal data outside of the EU to countries which have not been recognized as having adequate data protection standards, unless specific conditions are met. Our EU operations are currently operating in accordance with these standards. In May 2018, a new European-wide Regulation on data privacy came into force. The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), contains additional obligations on data controllers and data processors operating in the EU or offering services to consumers within the EU. While the core rules contained in the Data Protection Directive are retained in GDPR, there are significant enhancements with regard to the rights of data subjects (which include the right to be forgotten and the right of data portability), stricter regulation on obtaining consent to processing of personal data and sensitive personal data, stricter obligations with regard to the information to be included in privacy notices and significant enhanced requirements with regard to compliance, including a regime of “accountability” for processors and controllers and a requirement to embed compliance with GDPR into the fabric of an organization by developing appropriate policies and practices, to achieve a standard of data protection by “design and default.” The GDPR includes enhanced data security obligations (to run in parallel to those contained in NIS regulations), requiring data processors and controllers to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data they process and their systems. Organizations that process significant amounts of data may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer responsible for reporting to the highest level of management within the business. There are greatly enhanced sanctions under GDPR for failing to comply with the core principles of the GDPR or failing to secure data.

 Unfair trade practice regulations
 We and our clients are subject to various federal, state and international laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices, such as Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Various regulatory agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, various consumer protection agencies in Europe and other international markets, the CFPB, and state attorneys general, have authority to take action against parties that engage in unfair or deceptive trade practices or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments for a client that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions by those agencies.
 Anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, sanctions and counter-terrorist regulations
 We are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including certain sections of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other laws, that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures and include anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Many other jurisdictions where we conduct business also have similar anti-corruption laws and regulations. We have policies, procedures, systems, and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations.
 We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, or dealings with, specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.
 Similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to electronic currency transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in certain other countries. These laws require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process and our businesses in those jurisdictions are subject to such data retention obligations. For example, in the EU, certain of our businesses are subject to requirements under the Fourth Money Laundering Directive ((EU) 2015/849).
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,200 professionals. A majority of these employees are located in the United States, however many are also concentrated outside the United States, primarily in Mexico, Poland, Germany and Ireland. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
