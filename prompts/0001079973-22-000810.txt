ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Business Overview
 We are a medical technology company that has developed sugarBEAT®, a non-invasive, flexible, continuous glucose monitoring system, for adjunctive use by persons with diabetes, and any person wishing to determine factors influencing their blood glucose profiles. SugarBEAT® consists of a disposable adhesive skin-patch containing a sensor, which is connected to a rechargeable wireless transmitter. The sensor takes a measurement of the glucose reading every 5 minutes and sends the data by low energy blue tooth to a smart device such as mobile phone (both android and iOS). An app on the smart device uses a proprietary algorithm to display true glucose values, after the data is calibrated using a minimum of one finger stick calibration. SugarBEAT® works by extracting glucose from the skin into a chamber in the patch that is in direct contact with an electrode-based sensor. The data is recorded on the application and can be viewed in real time as well as storing all historic data for later evaluation as desired. We believe sugarBEAT® may be utilized by any person with diabetes, whether Type 1 or Type 2 and also by any persons wishing to determine factors affecting their blood glucose profiles, and therefore their state of metabolic health in terms of insulin resistance.
 On May 29, 2019, we announced that we had been awarded CE approval to allow sugarBEAT® to be legally sold in the European Union. CE approval is disclosed by the use of the CE mark, a manufacturers' declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European laws. The European clinical trial program for sugarBEAT® evaluated 525 patient days across 75 Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients and was completed in December 2017. CE approval is the process to achieve a mandatory conformity marking for the sugarBEAT® device to allow it to be legally sold in the European Union. It is a manufacturers' declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European laws. This approval is subject to an annual review of the underlying ISO 13485 accredited Quality Management System. The accreditation was successfully renewed in November 2021.
 We also submitted a PMA (Premarket Approval) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) with the same label claim as achieved for CE approval, an adjunct device for glucose trending for persons with diabetes. The PMA is currently under review.
 In July 2020, we filed a PMA application with the FDA to use sugarBEAT® as an adjunct to finger prick testing for blood glucose trending. We, along with other applicants, were then informed by the FDA that the approval process was subject to delays as a result of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”) being actively engaged in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in staff being reallocated to other approval requests associated with COVID-19. In April 2021 the FDA confirmed that it was recommencing its review of the PMA application, and in December 2021, the FDA’s Bio-monitoring research division conducted an audit of the clinical program submitted in support of the PMA application. A single 483 observation was raised, and the Company submitted a full response in January 2022. The FDA subsequently scheduled a pre-market inspection for the second calendar quarter of 2022, intended to cover the FDA’s Quality System/Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for Medical Devices (21 CFR Part 820).
 In addition to this, Nemaura established that proBEATTM, which is based on the sugarBEAT® platform, can be classified under the Wellness guidance when it is used according to the FDA Wellness guidance notes, to provide prompts and educate users on factors affecting their blood sugar profiles. Nemaura launched proBEAT™ in the U.S. in December 2020, as part of a diabetes prevention and reversal program branded BEATdiabetes.life, having licensed a clinically validated weight loss program for the management of diabetes from Healthimation, LLC, which was originally developed at the Joslin Diabetes Center, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. This program, together with proBEATTM, forms the BEATdiabetes.life program that is currently being developed for commercialization in the U.S. Key opinion leader (“KOL”) studies are ongoing and are intended to provide additional validation of and marketing support for the program in preparation for a broader U.S.-wide roll-out. We continue to monitor and respond to feedback received from these user-groups.
 We believe there are additional applications for sugarBEAT® and the underlying BEAT technology platform, which may include:
 
· | a web-server accessible by physicians and diabetes professionals to track the condition remotely, thereby reducing healthcare costs and managing the condition more effectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a complete virtual doctor that monitors a person's vital signs and transmits results via the web;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | other patches using the BEAT technology platform to measure alternative analytes, including lactate, uric acid, lithium and drugs. This would be a step-change in the monitoring of conditions, particularly in the hospital setting. Lactate monitoring is currently used to determine the relative fitness of professional athletes and we completed preliminary studies demonstrating the application of the BEAT technology for continuous lactate monitoring;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a continuous temperature monitoring system which could have various applications, including use for individuals to monitor their temperature in connection with diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms of novel coronavirus (COVID-19);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | monitoring disease progression in COVID-19 patients using continuous lactate monitoring (CLM).

Our Business Strategy
 We intend to lead in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative and targeted diagnostic medical devices, and data-driven digital platforms, that improve disease monitoring, management and overall patient care. Specifically, we intend to focus on the monitoring of molecules that can be drawn out through the skin non-invasively using our technology platform. In addition to glucose, such molecules may include lactic acid monitoring and the monitoring of prescription drugs and blood biomarkers that may help in the diagnosis, prevention, or management of diseases, such as diabetes. We plan to take the following steps to implement our broad business strategy. Our key commercial strategies post-approval will first be implemented in Europe and then in parts of the Middle East and Asia, and then the U.S., as follows:

- | Commercialize sugarBEAT® in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. We intend to commercialize sugarBEAT® in the United Kingdom, and Republic of Ireland with MySugarWatch Limited (previously known as Dallas Burston Ethitronix Limited) (“MSW”), with whom we have an exclusive marketing rights agreement for these two countries. We have also signed a full commercial agreement with MySugarWatch (Europe) Limited (previously known as Dallas Burston Ethitronix (Europe) Limited) in May 2018 for all other European territories as part of an equal joint venture agreement. The joint venture intends to seek sub-license rights opportunities to one or more leading companies in the diabetes monitoring space, to leverage their network, infrastructure and resources.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Establish licensing or joint venture agreements with other parties to market sugarBEAT® in other geographies. We are in detailed discussions and negotiations with several other parties worldwide for licensing or joint venture agreements for the sale of the sugarBEAT® device and have signed commercial agreements with TP MENA for the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Al-Danah Medical for Qatar.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Seek FDA PMA approval of sugarBEAT®. The PMA application is currently in review by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Expand the indications for which the sugarBEAT® device may be used. We believe that the sugarBEAT® device may offer significant benefits as compared to those found in the non-acute setting for the monitoring of other diseases. This includes monitoring of lactic acid for performance athletics, and the monitoring of drugs. We have completed initial proof of concept for lactate monitoring and now plan to explore the route to commercialization for well-being applications in athletic performance training, and plan to undertake further clinical programs to support clinical use of the device for lactate monitoring.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Expand our product pipeline through our proprietary platform technologies, acquisitions and strategic licensing arrangements. We intend to leverage our proprietary platform technologies to grow our portfolio of product candidates for the diagnosis of diabetes and other diseases. This includes digital platforms driven by data gathered by our sensors within the medical and wellbeing markets, such as for metabolic health monitoring. In addition, we intend to license our product and acquire products and technologies that are consistent with our research and development and business focus and strategies. This may include drug delivery products for the improved management of diabetes, for example improved insulin injector systems, and/or combination drug products for diabetes related drugs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product Development
 Management has extensive experience in regulatory and clinical development of diagnostic medical devices. We intend to take advantage of this experience in the field of diagnostic medical devices in an attempt to increase the probability of product approval. The overall regulatory process for diagnostic medical devices for diabetes is currently similar to those governing other diagnostic devices. The timelines are shorter than, for example, when new drugs or completely invasive diagnostic devices are trialed in clinics. We have successfully tested and evaluated the device for its clinical output, in this case the accuracy and safety with which it can trend blood glucose levels, based on which CE approval was granted by the Notified Body BSI. A PMA (pre-market approval) application was also submitted to the FDA and is currently under review. We continue to seek collaborations with future licensees and marketing partners to achieve our commercial growth milestones.
Market Opportunity for the Company's Products

According to the International Diabetes Federation Atlas 10th Edition 2021 (the "IDF"), there are approximately 537 million adults living with diabetes, representing 10.5% of the world’s population in this age group. This number is predicted to rise to 643 million (11.3%) by 2030 and to 783 million (12.2%) by 2045. Additionally an estimated 240 million people are living with undiagnosed diabetes worldwide, meaning almost one-in-two adults with diabetes are unaware they have the condition. The IDF identifies that almost 90% of people with undiagnosed diabetes live in low-and-middle income countries.
 Statistics published by the IDF evidence the fact that diabetes is a huge and growing problem, and that whilst the costs to society are already high, they continue to escalate. In addition, the IDF also notes that Europe has the highest prevalence of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, as well as the highest incidence annually. Europe is also reported as having the second highest average cost per person with diabetes ($3,086), with only North America and the Caribbean being higher ($8,208).

Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. The far more common Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin or doesn't make enough insulin.
 Various factors may contribute to Type 1 diabetes including genetics and exposure to certain viruses. Although Type 1 diabetes typically appears during childhood or adolescence, it also can develop in adults.
 Despite active research, Type 1 diabetes has no cure, although it can be managed. With proper treatment, people who have Type 1 diabetes can expect to live longer, healthier lives than they did in the past. Type 1 diabetes includes autoimmune Type 1 diabetes (Type 1a) which is characterized by having positive autoantibodies, as well as idiopathic Type 1 diabetes (Type 1b) where autoantibodies are negative, and c-peptide is low. Patients with Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) require long term treatment with exogenous insulin and these patients perform self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to calculate the appropriate dose of insulin. SMBG is done by using blood samples obtained by finger sticks but frequent SMBG does not detect all the significant deviations in blood glucose, specifically in patients who have rapidly fluctuating glucose levels.
 Type 2 diabetes, once known as adult-onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose), your body's main source of fuel. With Type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin, a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level. Untreated, Type 2 diabetes can be life-threatening.
 More common in adults, Type 2 diabetes increasingly affects children as childhood obesity increases. Whilst there is currently no acknowledged cure for Type 2 diabetes, there is increasing evidence to suggest that it can be effectively managed by eating well, exercising and maintaining a healthy weight. If diet and exercise don't control the blood sugar, diabetes medications or insulin therapy may be required.
 Each year, millions of patients undergo diabetes testing in the European Union and in the U.S. The main reason for this testing is to detect and evaluate diabetes in patients with symptoms of diabetes. These studies provide clinical benefit in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected but unproven diabetes, and in those patients in whom a diagnosis of diabetes has been established and information on prognosis or risk is required.
 We believe that our market opportunity is a direct function of the number of persons tested, diagnosed and treated for Type 2 diabetes. The IDF indicates that the total world market opportunity for a continuous glucose monitoring device is in the billions of dollars and is projected to grow annually as incidences of diabetes continue to grow.
 We do not believe it is possible to estimate the number of diabetes patients that undergo finger pricks or other types of invasive glucose monitoring. However, we are unaware of any product currently on the market that may allow for non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring. We believe the sugarBEAT® device may be readily adopted by the medical community for the assessment of a patient continuously.
 We believe our non-invasive sugarBEAT® device possesses many significant advantages and may represent an ideal device for the detection of discordances in an individual's blood sugar levels. We believe the CE approved sugarBEAT® device may represent a best-in-class non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring device to reach those afflicted with diabetes. While we cannot estimate the market share that our sugarBEAT® device may capture, we believe that the sugarBEAT® device will capture a significant share of the non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring market, in-particular the market that has been established by the Abbott Freestyle Libre device for glucose trending, as well as be adopted by non-insulin dependent diabetics who have not historically used continuous glucose monitoring devices due to their invasiveness.

Commercialization Plan 
 Throughout the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we have continued to work with our UK Licensee, MSW, to provide support in the development of their go-to-market strategy which incorporates the utilization of our sugarBEAT® device into their own branded product offering. While COVID-19 did result in some short delays to MSW’s user assessment program, the overall feedback was positive, albeit the anticipated timetable for purchase orders to be placed by MSW was extended out, with the first order for 5,000 sugarBEAT® transmitters and 200,000 sugarBEAT® sensors not being placed until April 2021. Our focus continues to be to support and optimize MSW’s launch program, in line with which, we took the following actions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022: 

· | Entered into a new leased facility to provide additional capacity for commercial assembly to commence.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased headcount of production operatives to facilitate product manufacture.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Placed forward orders for raw materials to support scale-up and secure inventory of those items that are currently in short supply globally i.e. semi-conductors etc.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Appointed Benchmark Electronics Inc.as our CMO partner to facilitate future volume scale up of transmitter production via its FDA approved facility in Thailand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Signed a new global agreement for the provision of our sugarBEAT® device with MySugarWatch DuoPack Limited (“MSW-DP”). Under the terms of the agreement, our CGM and sensors will be provided as Duo-Packs with prescription only medicines that are widely prescribed for people with Type 2 diabetes. The initial Duo-Pack presentation will be launched as the first of these medicines loses its patent protection in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Commenced phased delivery of transmitters against the purchase order received from MSW in December 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also advanced our plans to develop our go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., which included:
 
· | Development of a US based standalone team is ongoing and this activity will continue for the foreseeable future.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In July 2020, we submitted a PMA application to the FDA for the sugarBEAT® device for glucose profiling as an adjunct to a finger-stick measurement. We, along with other applicants, were then informed by the FDA that the approval process was subject to delays as a result of the CDRH being actively engaged in responding to the pandemic caused by COVID-19 which resulted in staff being reallocated to other approval requests associated with COVID-19. In April 2021, the FDA confirmed that it would recommence its review of the PMA application and this is now ongoing and in-progress.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In December 2021, the FDA’s Bio-monitoring research division conducted an audit of the clinical program submitted in support of the PMA application. A single 483 observation was raised, and the Company submitted a full response in January 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The FDA subsequently conducted a pre-market inspection for during the second calendar quarter of 2022, covering the FDA’s Quality System / Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for Medical Devices (21 CFR Part 820). Once again a single 483 observation was made, and this was responded to within the mandated time frame. The company continues its dialogue with the FDA with respect to the PMA submission and plans to provide further material updates as they arise in due course.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to this, we continue to explore commercialization opportunities in other key geographic markets, which includes engaging with the German regulatory authority (GBA) to establish how best to proceed with achieving reimbursement for sugarBEAT® in Germany, as well as continuing to engage in dialogue with additional potential licensees / distributors in other geographical territories. 
 Competitive Landscape
 To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no other competing devices on the market that offer continuous glucose monitoring and profiling, non-invasively, with a single day sensor wear. We believe this positions us uniquely in a market where we can target persons with diabetes as well as those that are pre-diabetic. Additionally, we believe that this can also be used to improve outcomes in weight management and wellbeing markets. There are companies, such as Dexcom and Abbott, that currently offer Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors with 10 and 14 continuous day wear, respectively. These companies could be deemed future competitors were they to:

– | develop and market products that are less expensive or more effective than our current and/or future products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may compete for market share against these companies and potential newcomers in this general field. These potential competitors, either alone or together with their partners, may develop new products that will compete with ours, and these competitors may, and in certain cases do, operate larger research and development programs, or have substantially greater financial resources than we do.
 As noted, while it is difficult to analyze our major competitors since currently there are no non-invasive diagnostic medical devices to continuously monitor blood glucose levels, we anticipate that specific companies may compete with us in the future.
 Regulatory Requirements 

Our device has undergone the applicable electrical safety testing and biocompatibility has been demonstrated against the relevant European Directives, Regulations and Standards. If and when new materials are introduced, they will undergo a biocompatibility risk assessment, and further testing where necessary. Batches of the device and patches were manufactured for human clinical studies that took place between November 2014 and December 2015. This was a functional watch device with a wire connection to a skin adhered sensor and electrode. Subsequent to studies conducted in India the device received a CE mark approval in February 2016. The device has since been upgraded to reduce it in size, include an enhanced sensor system and allow wireless communication from a body worn transmitter. This miniaturized wireless device achieved CE approval in May 2019, and a PMA was submitted to the U.S. FDA in July 2020 and is currently in review. An application for CE mark approval requires the Company to have an ISO13485 Quality Management System, covering the design, development and manufacture of a medical device. Nemaura Medical does not have this accreditation, and instead under the terms of a service contract dated April 4, 2018, with Nemaura Pharma Limited (“Pharma”), Nemaura Medical has outsourced the CE approval registration process to Pharma. Pharma, a related company, is controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder, Dr D.F.H. Chowdhury. Under the terms of the service contract Pharma has undertaken all required activities to register the product for CE approval under a fee for service arrangement, while Nemaura Medical will retain full title and beneficial ownership of the CE mark, and all related intellectual property without any further payments or royalties becoming due other than the fee for service. 
Intellectual Property
 We believe that clear and extensive intellectual property relating to our technologies is central to long-term success and we intend to invest accordingly. This applies to both domestic and international patent coverage, and trade secrets, and trademarks.
 The sugarBEAT® technology is protected by our portfolio of intellectual property comprised of issued and pending patents and trade secrets covering a range of claims, including the methods and apparatus for measuring glucose extracted from human skin in a non-invasive manner, devices for extracting glucose from the skin is a stable manner, devices for reducing background noise signals, algorithm for converting raw data in to glucose values to calibrate the device, and the formulation and process for preparation of the enzyme solution used in the sensor.
 On May 8, 2014, NDM Technologies Limited, a related company, assigned the UK patent application 1208950.4 and International (PCT) patent application PCT/GB2013/051322 entitled "Cumulative Measurement of an Analyte" to Dermal Diagnostics Limited (“DDL”) for a nominal consideration.
 Two additional patents were filed in 2018 relating to the sensor and device application, which are expected to provide further strength to the intellectual property position. Additional patents are intended to be filed in the future relating to the device and sensor, providing new intellectual property protection. Some of the recently filed patents and future patents may supersede previous intellectual property.
 Additionally, we retain substantial trade secrets relating to aspects of the sensor manufacture process and the sensor formulation, which have taken over five years to develop, and will prove challenging to reverse engineer as it consists of formulation components in addition to processing methods in complex combinations that are unique to the final functional sensor. Patents will not be filed on this aspect of the technology to avoid any public dissemination of the know-how.
 These patents and know-how cover aspects of the technology platform. Furthermore, the trademarks BEAT® and sugarBEAT® have been registered in multiple key global territories. Accordingly, all intellectual property essential to the sugarBEAT® product is owned by us, and not subject to royalty payments. We intend to take the lead in the preservation and/or prosecution of these patents and patent applications going forward as required. We intend to file additional patents as the development progresses, where deemed to be of value to protecting the technology platform and future modifications and improvements. Where patents cannot be secured, the intellectual property will be limited to know-how and trade secrets, and these will be diligently guarded.

Clinical Trials
 Our clinical testing is conducted by contract clinical research organizations in various centers around the world to cover a wide demographic – including Asia and Europe – and is managed by our in-house management team.
 We had 2 pre-submission meetings with the FDA in June 2016, to define the clinical roadmap. As a result, a detailed clinical plan was developed and approved internally and a clinical site in Europe was selected and audited and approved for commencement of clinical studies using the body worn transmitter device version of the sugarBEAT®. The study was completed, and a PMA application submitted to the FDA in July 2020.
 The data from these studies was also submitted as part of the CE approval in Europe was received in May 2019.
 Research and development
 We spent $1,556,988 and $1,554,603 during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on research and development; management currently anticipated that spend in this area will remain reasonably consistent in the coming fiscal year.
 Manufacturing
 The manufacture and sale of CE certified medical devices are controlled and governed by guidelines stipulated in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), more specifically ISO13485; sugarBEAT® will be manufactured and marketed according to ISO13485 quality standards.
 In support of commercial sales of sugarBEAT® in the UK and EU we have worked with our manufacturing partner Nemaura Pharma, to scale-up manufacturing of the various sugarBEAT® components alongside facilities for final assembly and packaging. As part of this process, we have expanded our manufacturing and assembly capabilities by occupying additional space within our existing headquarters site at Loughborough University Science and Enterprise Park (LUSEP) in the UK.
 We have entered into the following types of agreements with various manufacturing partners:
 
– | Manufacturing agreements for the sensor manufacture
--+----------------------------------------------------


– | Manufacturing agreements for the patch manufacture
--+---------------------------------------------------


– | Manufacturing agreements for the CGM transmitter device and re-charging station manufacture

Sales and Marketing
 An Exclusive Marketing Rights agreement for the UK and Republic of Ireland was signed on March 31, 2014 with Dallas Burston Pharma, a Jersey (Channel Island) based company (“DB Pharma”) (subsequently updated in 2018 and again in 2021 to include a change in the company name to MySugarWatch Limited “MSW”), who has pharmaceutical product marketing operations in the UK and has demonstrated a very successful model for the marketing of prescription medical products directly to general practitioners. We received a non-refundable upfront payment of £1 million ($1.67 million at the then exchange rate) in return for providing MSW with the exclusive right to sell the sugarBEAT® device in the UK and Republic of Ireland, both direct to consumer and through prescriptions by general practitioners. The key terms of the Exclusive Marketing Rights Agreement were concluded in a Commercial Agreement signed in August 2015. This agreement was updated and re-issued in October 2019 to cover new IP / improvements to the technology.
 In addition, a joint venture agreement was entered into with MySugar Watch (Europe) Limited (previously known as Dallas Burston Ethitronix (Europe) Limited) in May 2018, whereby we will share equally the costs and net profits of the sales of our sugarBEAT® system in all territories in Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, which is the subject of a separate agreement with MSW. This agreement was updated and re-issued in October 2019 to cover new IP/ improvements to the technology. Commercial agreements were signed in 2018 with TPMENA and Al-Danah Medical, for the Gulf Region (GCC) and Qatar respectively.
Regulatory matters
 Government Regulation
 Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, and health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change, or new laws may be enacted.
 Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business.
 United Kingdom and Wales and the European Union regulations
 Government authorities in the United Kingdom and Wales and the European Union as well as other foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labelling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export of medical devices, including patches and other pharmaceutical products. Our body worn transmitter devices in the United Kingdom and Wales will be subject to strict regulation and require regulatory approval prior to commercial distribution. The process of obtaining governmental approvals and complying with ongoing regulatory requirements requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new legislation or regulations may be issued that could delay such approvals. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the authority's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawals of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The European Commission on Public Health (the "ECPH") provides the regulation for the development and commercialization of new medical diagnostic devices. Any medical device placed on the European market must comply with the relevant legislation, notably with Directive 93/42/EEC for medical devices, with the active implantable devices Directive (90/385/EEC) or with the in vitro devices Directive (98/79/EC). From 26th May 2021, all newly approved medical devices must comply with the Medical Device Regulation (2017/745). Before manufacture / import, it must be determined whether the device in question falls under any of these Directives. All medical devices must fulfil the essential requirements set out in the above-mentioned directives. Where available, relevant standards may be used to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements defined in the devices Directives.
 Manufacturers also need to determine the appropriate conformity assessment route. For devices falling under Directive 93/42/EEC / Regulation 2017/745, other than custom-made devices and devices intended for clinical investigation, the conformity assessment route depends on the class of the device, to be determined in accordance with certain rules set forth in the directives / regulations. Once the applicable class or list has been determined, manufacturers need to follow the appropriate conformity assessment procedure. Subject to the type of the device, this may require manufacturers to have their quality systems and technical documentation reviewed by a Notified Body before they can place their products on the market. A Notified Body is a third-party body that can carry out a conformity assessment recognized by the European Union. The Notified Body will need to assure itself that relevant requirements have been met before issuing relevant certification. Manufacturers can then place the CE marking on their products to demonstrate compliance with the requirements.

The CE approval is the process of achieving a mandatory conformity marking for the sugarBEAT® device to allow it to be legally sold in the European Union. It is a manufacturers' declaration that the product meets the requirements of the applicable European laws. The process for the sugarBEAT® device CE submission and approval involved the following:
 1. The device is classified depending on certain categories described by the European Directive with Class I products being low risk (e.g., band aid plasters), with Class III devices being the highest risk. The classes are Class I, IIa, IIb and III. Risk is based upon the potential harm to the patient should a problem arise with a product or its use. The sugarBEAT® device is classified as a IIb device.
 
2. A 'technical file' containing all of the information required to demonstrate that the product meets the essential requirements of the European directive will be prepared. This includes information relating to performance and safety of the device such as product specifications, labelling, instructions for use, risk analysis and specific test information/clinical evidence relating to the product that support the claims being made for the product.
 
3. Clinical evidence included in the technical file is expected to demonstrate that the device is safe and meets defined performance requirements. This clinical evidence can be in the form of literature data where substantial published data exists that utilizes the same technique for glucose extraction and measurement (albeit in a different device format), or data from actual clinical studies performed using the sugarBEAT® device. The first CE mark submission was based on literature evaluation of 3rd party published clinical data available in the public domain. The final CE mark submission has claims based on the clinical performance of the device, based on clinical studies described earlier herein. The clinical data showed that the sugarBEAT® device can trend blood glucose levels in a human subject by taking measurements every 5 minutes. The clinical trial data demonstrates the sugarBEAT® device blood glucose trend can be used to supplement normal finger prick measurements.
 
4. The technical file has been assessed by an independent inspector (the Notified Body), regulated by the competent authority, (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA in the United Kingdom). The Notified Body (an organization in the European Union that has been accredited by a member state to determine whether a medical device complies with the European medical device directives), will then notify The European Commission on Public Health (the "ECPH") of the approval and a certificate will be issued to the Company by the notified body and we will then be able to apply the CE mark to the device, and legally offer the product for sale in the European Economic Area (EEA). The CE mark has been issued as of May 2019 and the company is now able to offer the device for commercial sale in the EU.

5. The review of the technical file commenced in August 2018, and the final review and sign off was received in May 2019. Since the CE mark was approved, we have undergone routine inspections of our ISO 13485 Quality Management System in order to maintain our CE mark accreditation. An addendum was also submitted to the notified body and approval obtained, to include within the approved CE marked device, the iOS version of the smart device app that the transmitter connects to.
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulation of medical devices
 The US Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. sugarBEAT® is a medical device that is subject to these, as well as other federal, state, local and foreign, laws and regulations. The FDA is responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations governing medical devices in the United States.
 The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, Class II, or Class III) depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment is a factor in determining the type of premarketing submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the United States. SugarBEAT® falls under Class III.
 
– | Class I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to "general controls" (e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing practices, labelling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all classes of medical devices.)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Class II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and "special controls" (e.g., special labelling, compliance with performance standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (510(k)) process.)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Class III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, or for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to determine that application of special controls would provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require FDA approval of a PMA application before marketing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially marketed, distributed or sold in the United States. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance and PMA. After preliminary discussions with the FDA in June 2016 as part of a pre-submission meeting it was determined that the pathway for sugarBEAT® would be a PMA approval.

Premarket approval pathway
 The PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process.
 After a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, in reality, the review time is normally longer (e.g., 1-3 years). During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to whether the data provides a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, which imposes comprehensive development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements for the design and manufacturing of a medical device.
 Based on its review, the FDA may (i) issue an order approving the PMA, (ii) issue a letter stating the PMA is "approvable" (e.g., minor additional information is needed), (iii) issue a letter stating the PMA is "not approvable," or (iv) issue an order denying PMA. A company may not market a device subject to PMA review until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval, the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labelling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
 Most modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labelling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA supplement and the FDA's time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification.
 In February 2020 Nemaura announced that following discussions with the FDA, it was established that Nemaura may sell its CGM product with a digital service offering in the U.S. without FDA approval as a non-medical wellbeing application. Nemaura further announced that it intended to launch this product under the brand proBEATÔ in the U.S. in October to December 2020. The product enables users to wear the CGM device from which data will be sent to Nemaura’s servers in the cloud, from where data will be processed to provide users with educational material and insights into factors that can affect their sugar levels and tips for healthy lifestyle and diet, with a view to helping pre-diabetics and diabetics alike live healthier lives. A limited product launch commenced in the U.S. in December 2020 to enabled potential customers to register their interest utilizing proBEATÔ in conjunction with a digital program for weight loss targeted at persons with diabetes, under the brand BEATdiabetes.life.
 Clinical trials
 Clinical trials of medical devices in the U.S. are governed by the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") regulation. This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc.
 Clinical trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health) require FDA and Institutional Review Board ("IRB") approval prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is obtained through submission of an IDE application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk ("NSR") devices (i.e., devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) only require IRB approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or NSR; however, a reviewing IRB and/or FDA may review this decision and disagree with the determination.
 An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 As noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post-market setting.
 The collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. The FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post-market surveillance study for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved.

Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
 After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include, but are not limited to:


– | Establishment registration and device listing requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


– | Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labelling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Labelling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labelling, and generally require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier ("UDI"), and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., "off-label," uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Medical Device Reporting ("MDR") regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be non-reportable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions:


– | Untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


– | Fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


– | Recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------


– | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Refusing a request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | Criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------


We would be subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers' facilities.
 Other Regulation in the United Kingdom and Wales and the EU
 Healthcare Reimbursement
 Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the United Kingdom and Wales. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical products. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for products. Some third-party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the product until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.
Environmental Regulation
 We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the United Kingdom and Wales. Like many other medical device companies, our operations involve the use of substances, including hazardous wastes, which are regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. These laws and regulations are all subject to change, however, and we cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Regulation

Whether or not we obtain regulatory approval for a product, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for EC approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country.
 In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States. We face the risk that the prices which result from the regulatory approval process would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our collaborators.

EU General Data Protection Regulation 

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) came into force in all EU Member States from May 25, 2018 and replaced previous EU data privacy laws. Although a number of basic existing principles will remain the same, the GDPR introduces new obligations on data controllers and rights for data subjects, including, among others:

– | accountability and transparency requirements, which will require data controllers to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and to provide more detailed information to data subjects regarding processing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | enhanced data consent requirements, which includes “explicit” consent in relation to the processing of sensitive data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | obligations to consider data privacy as any new products or services are developed and limit the amount of information collected, processed, stored and its accessibility;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | constraints on using data to profile data subjects;
--+----------------------------------------------------


– | providing data subjects with personal data in a useable format on request and erasing personal data in certain circumstances; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


– | reporting of breaches without undue delay (72 hours where feasible).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


The GDPR also introduced new fines and penalties for a breach of requirements, including fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20m and fines of up to the higher of 2% of annual worldwide revenue or €10m (whichever is highest) for other specified infringements. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when imposing fines (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement).
 The Company has assessed the implications of the GDPR on all personal data it holds and has implemented measures to ensure that personal data shall be:
 
- | Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Collected for a specified, explicit and legitimate purpose and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Maintained accurately and up to date and that every reasonable step is taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At the current stage of the Company’s development and, with being pre-revenue at this stage, the scope of data held, and consequently the impact of GDPR, is limited. Increased application of GDPR will be assessed and implemented prior to further Company developments that warrant additional GDPR measures. As the Company progresses with product commercialization, the extent to which GDPR will affect the Company will increase, which will require additional changes to the Company’s procedures and policies which could adversely impact operational and compliance costs. Further, there is a risk that the measures will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within the business will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are breaches of these measures, the Company could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition, and prospects.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Board of Directors assessed the adequacy of the group’s organizational structure and concluded that an intermediary holding company, Region Green Limited, was no longer required as the entity had been effectively dormant since inception and no longer represented a requirement to be maintained. It was therefore determined that Region Green Limited should be unwound, with the assets held by Region Green Limited being transferred up to Nemaura Medical Inc. following which Region Green Limited would be dissolved.

The transfer of assets took place on March 5, 2021 and Region Green Limited was formally dissolved as of April 23, 2021.
 In December 2013, we restructured the Company and re-domiciled as a domestic corporation in the United States. The corporate re-organization was accomplished to preserve the tax advantages under the laws of the England and Wales tax laws for the benefit of the shareholders of both Dermal Diagnostics Limited and Trial Clinic Limited.
 DDL is a diagnostic medical device company headquartered in Loughborough, Leicestershire, England. DDL was founded on January 20, 2009, to engage in the discovery, development and commercialization of diagnostic medical devices. The Company’s initial focus has been on the development of a novel CGM device.

ATM Offering
 On July 23, 2021, Company entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time to or through the Agent shares of the Company’s common stock.
 The offer and sale of shares of common stock through the Agent will be made pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-230535), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 8, 2019, and a related prospectus supplement pursuant to which the Company offered shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000.
 Under the ATM Agreement, the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock through the Agent by any method deemed to be an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through The Nasdaq Capital Market, sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange or otherwise, directly to the Agent as principal, in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to such prevailing market prices, and/or in any other method permitted by law. If the Company elects to utilize the ATM Agreement, the Agent would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulations to sell such shares in accordance with the Company’s instructions (including as to price, time or size limit or other parameters or conditions the Company may impose). The Company will pay the Agent a commission of 3.0% of the gross sales price of any shares of common stock sold under the ATM Agreement. The Company has also provided the Agent with customary indemnification rights and has agreed to reimburse the Agent for certain specified expenses up to $20,000 plus up to $2,500 per quarter while the ATM Agreement remains in effect.

The Company is not obligated to sell, and the Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement. The Company or the Agent may terminate the ATM Agreement by providing notice to the other party. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from any ATM offering for general corporate purposes, which include, but are not limited to, the targeted launch of sugarBEAT® into other European markets outside of the UK; the development of the subscription-based service for the U.S. under the Wellness category that was launched in December 2020; establishing a business-to-consumer offering for a metabolic health program; research and development of our BEAT platform for other, non, CGM purposes, such as Lactate monitoring, as well as potential acquisition of other companies, products or technologies that are complementary to the delivery of our mission. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion as to the use of the net proceeds from any ATM offering under this agreement.
