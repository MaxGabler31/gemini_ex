ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless otherwise stated in this Annual Report, references to "AppFolio," "we," "us," and "our" refer to AppFolio, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We were formed in 2006 with a vision to revolutionize the way that small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, grow and compete by enabling their digital transformation. Today we provide industry-specific, cloud-based software solutions to the real estate market, which comprises a significant majority of our revenue, and the legal market, and we intend to enter new vertical markets over time. In 2008, we entered the real estate market with our first product, AppFolio Property Manager, or APM, a property management solution designed to address the unique operational and business requirements of property management companies. Recognizing that our customers would benefit from additional business-critical services that they can purchase as needed, we launched a series of Value+ services beginning in 2009. In 2012, we entered the legal market by acquiring MyCase, a legal practice and case management solution primarily for solo practitioners and small law firms. 
SMBs face a common set of challenges that divert limited time and resources away from serving their clients and growing their businesses. Day-to-day operations are often managed through inefficient manual processes and disparate software point solutions. This lack of automation and integrated technology results in a significant administrative burden on these businesses, particularly in industries that involve unique workflows, relationships among multiple industry participants, significant data inputs and management, and compliance or regulatory requirements. While larger enterprises and consumers have been experiencing a transformational shift into the digital age, the legacy systems and manual business processes currently used by many SMBs are lagging behind in terms of technological sophistication and ease of use. 
Our mission is to revolutionize vertical industry businesses by providing great software and services. We accomplish this mission by delivering software solutions and services that provide our customers with a system of record to automate essential business processes, a system of engagement to enhance business interactions between our customers and their clients and vendors, and, increasingly, a system of intelligence to anticipate, influence, and optimize customer experiences using data to take action in real time. We have built our software solutions using a modern cloud-based architecture, and our mobile-optimized software solutions are designed for use across multiple devices and operating systems. 
Although specific functionality varies by product, our core solutions address common business operations and interactions of SMBs in our targeted verticals by providing key functionality, including accounting, document management, real-time interactive search, data analytics and communication options. In addition to our core solutions, we offer a range of optional, but often business-critical, Value+ services. Our Value+ services are available on an as-needed basis and enable our customers to adapt our platform to their specific operational requirements. Over time, we anticipate offering additional Value+ services across our targeted verticals as appropriate for each particular market. We apply our disciplined market validation approach and customer-focused philosophy to select and develop additional Value+ services, as well as new core functionality, and to identify the most suitable adjacent markets and new verticals to target. 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $143.8 million, $105.6 million and $75.0 million, respectively. During each of these years we have derived more than 90% of our revenue from our solutions serving the real estate market. Our revenue has limited seasonality as discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report, within the section entitled "Quarterly Revenue and Cost Trends." We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, heavily in our business to capitalize on our market opportunity.
Our Solutions 
AppFolio Property Manager - Core Solution
APM is a cloud-based software solution for the real estate market that provides property managers of various sizes (including both third-party managers and owner-operators) innovative tools and services designed to streamline their property management businesses. Our software solution serves a variety of property types, including single- and multi-family residential, commercial, community association, and student housing, and is continuously evolving to help our customers more effectively market, manage and grow their businesses. Core functionality addresses key operational issues, including posting and tracking vacancies, efficiently leasing vacant properties, facilitating tenant, owner and vendor communications, and accounting, among other things.

AppFolio Property Manager - Value+ Services
In addition to our core solution, we offer the following optional Value+ services to our APM customers. These Value+ services are integrated with our software solution and built to support workflows essential to our customers’ businesses.
Website Services. We deliver and maintain professionally designed and architected websites that showcase our customers’ businesses. Our websites are fully-integrated with APM functionality, including vacancy postings, payment options, owner portals, and maintenance requests. Property managers can track and analyze site traffic and lead generation and identify prospects by evaluating guest cards that are completed by prospective tenants who visit the websites in connection with posted vacancies.
Electronic Payment Services. Our payments platform allows property managers to streamline their payables and receivables online. Our customers can collect rental application fees, rent payments, and other tenant charges all through a secure online portal, as well as receive owner contributions. They can quickly and conveniently pay owners, vendors and even their own management companies through APM.
Tenant Screening Services. We offer instant background screening and credit checks for use in connection with the rental application process, leveraging an automated nationwide eviction and criminal records search. Customers also have the option to access and/or contribute to Experian Rent Bureau rental payments history data, updated every 24 hours, to identify quality residents and reduce the risk of bad debts.
Insurance. We offer two insurance products — legal liability to landlord insurance and renters insurance — that can be tailored to help property managers get the maximum protection for their properties and meet renters’ needs, whether proof of insurance is required or not. Customers can instantly enroll residents in legal liability to landlord, which offers owners and investors increased protection against resident-caused damage. Individual renters also have the option to purchase renters insurance to protect their personal belongings, as well as the property itself from unexpected damages.
Contact Center. Our contact center is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and serves as an extension of our property manager customers’ offices to resolve or route incoming maintenance requests. Contact center agents are able to enter non-emergency work orders directly into APM’s property maintenance software for a property manager’s approval and dispatch vendors immediately in case of an emergency.
Premium Leads. Our customers have the option to upgrade a property vacancy listing to premium status, thereby instantly syndicating it to dozens of pay-to-list websites, including featured placement on many free sites. Customers also receive advanced call tracking and only pay for verified leads that they receive through the service.
Tenant Debt Collections. Our customers may choose to utilize a nationwide contingency-based debt collection service provided by a nationally-licensed third party provider. Property managers are able to electronically send past due tenant debt from their APM database directly to the collections service for processing. The service also includes reporting unpaid balances to three major credit bureaus.
MyCase - Core Solution
Our legal software solution, MyCase, enables solo practitioners and small law firms to more efficiently administer their practice and manage their caseload. MyCase is continuously evolving to help our customers more effectively market, manage and grow their businesses, and contains core functionality that addresses key operational issues, including managing calendars, contacts and documents, time tracking, billing and collections, communicating with clients and sharing sensitive and privileged materials.
MyCase - Value+ Services
In addition to our core solution for MyCase, we offer the following optional Value+ services to our legal customers.
Website Services. We deliver and maintain professionally designed and architected websites that practitioners and their clients can utilize to access case and matter information, communicate, and manage bills. Our websites are fully-integrated with the MyCase platform and designed to improve the effectiveness of law firm marketing, streamline daily business tasks, and increase mobile presence.

Electronic Payment Services. Our payments platform allows practitioners to streamline billing and receivables online. Our customers can quickly and conveniently bill their clients and receive payments electronically through MyCase's secure online portal.
Our Customers 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 11,708 property manager customers that directly and indirectly accounted for more than 90% of our annual revenue. Our property manager customers typically manage portfolios ranging from 50 to 3,000 units, and include third-party managers and owner-operators who manage single- and multi-family residences, commercial properties, community associations and student housing, as well as mixed real estate portfolios. 
We also had 9,349 solo practitioners and small law firms - the latter typically with fewer than 20 lawyers - that directly and indirectly accounted for less than 10% of our annual revenue. 
We define our customer base as the number of customers subscribing to our core solutions, exclusive of free trial periods with respect to MyCase. No individual customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Our Culture and Employees 
We believe our people are at the heart of our success and our customers’ success, and have worked hard not only to attract and hire quality individuals but also to nurture and develop our valuable human resources. We believe in the strong team we have cultivated, particularly in our deep bench of leaders who continue to execute our strategic plans and encourage innovation across the organization. We further believe that our company culture, driven by a dedication to the following six core values, provides us with a significant competitive advantage: 

▪ | Simpler Is Better


▪ | Great, Innovative Products Are Key To A Great Business


▪ | Great People Make A Great Company


▪ | Listening To Customers Is In Our DNA


▪ | Small, Focused Teams Keep Us Agile


▪ | We Do The Right Thing Because It’s Good For Business

As of December 31, 2017, we had 672 employees, and we consider our relationship with them to be very good. We also hire temporary employees and consultants, and feel similarly about our relationships with them. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
Our Growth Strategy
We have managed, and plan to continue to manage, our business towards the achievement of long-term growth that we believe will positively impact long-term stockholder value, rather than the realization of short-term financial or business metrics, or short-term stockholder value. Our growth strategy is to provide increasingly valuable cloud-based business management software solutions to SMBs within each specific vertical we choose to target. Key components of our growth strategy include:
Maintain Product and Technology Leadership. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and product development to expand our core functionality and add new Value+ services in existing and/or new vertical markets. We intend to continue using our market validation techniques and close relationships with our customers as a key source of feedback to inform and direct our product roadmap. We may also choose to acquire rather than build certain functionality to serve our existing verticals or facilitate our entry into adjacent markets or new verticals. 
Keep Our Existing Customers Happy. Customer success is essential to our long-term success. We place significant emphasis on customer service to differentiate our software solutions from competing products and this will continue to be a critical component of our business strategy in the future. We believe that maintaining our focus on customer satisfaction will drive greater adoption and utilization of our software solutions over time. 
Expand Adoption and Use By Existing Customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments that expand our core functionality and add new Value+ services in existing vertical markets to meet the evolving needs 
4

and requirements of our customers. We expect our customers will continue to use our technology to manage their businesses and increasingly adopt and use additional Value+ services. 
Target New Customers. We plan to grow our customer base with our sales and marketing programs, including evolving industry thought leadership and education, and the referral power of satisfied customers promoting our software solutions within our targeted verticals. 
Enter New Adjacent Markets. We continue to evaluate adjacent markets based on our market validation strategy and customer feedback. We firmly believe that, while we are continuously developing our software solution within one market, we can apply certain relevant product enhancements and learnings from that market as we extend our platform into each successive adjacent market. 
Expand into New Verticals. We continue to review potential opportunities to expand into additional vertical markets. In that regard, we use market validation techniques to assess the scope and nature of business challenges in any potential new vertical, as well as the likelihood that our target customers may purchase a cloud-based solution to solve their problems in that vertical, and their potential spend on such solutions. Any new vertical also must fit within our overall business strategy, including our management team's assessment of available alternatives, such as the number and size of potential adjacent market opportunities, and the relative risk and return of these opportunities. 
Sales and Marketing
We leverage a modern marketing approach along with marketing automation technology to build brand recognition and our reputation as an industry leader in our targeted verticals.
We participate in and drive industry thought leadership and education with both online and offline activities, and use a variety of marketing techniques to promote our software solutions. Our sales development team acts in partnership with our marketing organization to reach potential customers, generate additional sales opportunities and speed the time from evaluation to close. Our sales representatives then assist prospective property manager customers as they evaluate APM, while prospective law firm customers generally sign up for a 30-day free trial on a self-service basis (with additional support from a live sales development representative as needed).
Our interactive sales methodology allows our sales team to quickly build relationships, assess our customers’ business challenges, and demonstrate the benefits of our core functionality and Value+ services. Throughout the customer relationship, we continue to promote adoption and usage of our Value+ services through a variety of channels, including email, webinars, training, sales outreach and from within our software solution via in-app messaging.
Customer Service
Our success is based on long-term customer retention, not a one-time sale, and we partner with our customers throughout the life of the relationship to help them navigate their digital transformation. We design our software solutions to be simple and easy to implement, use and manage, and offer unlimited training and support at no extra charge. We pride ourselves on being customer-centric and strive to educate our customers on the additional core functionality and Value+ services they can use to improve business efficiency and productivity.
Our onboarding team strives to ensure that customers are prepared to run their businesses on our platform and provide a seamless onboarding experience. As a result of our assistance with data migration matters, we are able to provide valuable insights into data integrity and work diligently with our customers to help resolve any issues in their underlying business processes. We also assist our customers with the configuration of our platform for particular property types or cases, as appropriate. We provide a dedicated team throughout the onboarding process and beyond, and share insights on best practices in both of our targeted verticals. In addition, certain members of our Value+ teams are focused on guiding our customers through the adoption and utilization of our Value+ services.
Technology and Operations
Data Security and Availability
We use Ruby-on-Rails as our web application framework for both APM and MyCase. Our software solutions run on a combination of both public and private cloud infrastructure, consisting of both our own servers and Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud platform. Our servers are located in state-of-the-art data centers operated by third-party service providers. Physical security 
5

at these facilities includes a variety of access controls, including electronic keycards, pin codes, biometric hand scans and mantraps, and policing by high resolution, motion sensitive video surveillance. These facilities provide redundant power and a system of heating, ventilating and air conditioning, as well as fire-threat detection and suppression. We utilize a system of redundant routers, switches, server clusters and back-up systems to help ensure high availability. Amazon is widely recognized for operating state-of-the-art, highly available data centers.
With respect to Internet security, sensitive data, such as passwords, Social Security and tax identification numbers, are encrypted before being written to disk. In addition, all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Data is backed up using Amazon’s Simple Storage Service providing high durability, and we also perform regular backups of all customer data. We evaluate our Internet security regularly, including through third-party penetration testing.
In addition, our software solutions allow our customers to define roles that provide different levels of access to users, allowing them to view and modify specific items depending on their role. Supervisors can distribute work to on-site staff in a secure and controlled environment, while leadership retains visibility across the entire system.
Research and Product Development
We entrust product design, development and testing to our team of engineers, who coordinate closely with our product management team to launch new core functionality and Value+ services. Our engineers are organized in smaller groups to foster agility and continued innovation in responding to the evolving needs of our customers. We leverage a collaborative, team-based and test-driven approach to engineering in order to release new code frequently. We believe that it is easier for our customers to adjust to continuous updates to our software solutions, which incrementally change and improve their user experience, than it is to adapt to infrequent, but more drastic upgrades of legacy on-premise software.
We rely heavily on input from our customers in developing products that meet their needs and in anticipating developments in their respective industries. Our product management team leads our research and market validation efforts and provides guidance to management and our engineering team based on our collective domain expertise and in-depth knowledge and understanding of our customers. As a result, our product management team engages regularly with customers, partners and other industry participants, as well as our customer service and sales and marketing organizations. Our product management team manages our development projects generally and serves to align separate functions within the company with a single strategic vision.

Our research and product development expenses were $16.6 million, $12.6 million and $9.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Competition 
The overall market for business management software is global, highly competitive and continually evolving in response to changes in technology, operational requirements, laws and regulations. While we focus on providing software solutions to SMBs in each of our targeted verticals, we believe our competitors fall into the following primary categories: 

• | On-premise or cloud-based vertical market business management software providers that serve companies of all sizes in our markets; and


• | On-premise or cloud-based horizontal business management software providers that offer broad solutions across multiple verticals.

We also see competition from numerous cloud-based solution providers that focus almost exclusively on one or more point solutions. For example, in the property management vertical, we compete with listing services, tenant screening applications and specialists in lease forms. In the legal vertical, we compete with time tracking, legal billing and payment services. Continued consolidation among cloud-based solution providers could lead to significantly increased competition. 
We believe the principal competitive factors in each of our vertical markets include the following: 
▪ease of deployment and use of software solutions and applications; 
▪total cost of ownership; 
▪data security and availability; 
▪breadth and depth of functionality in software solutions and applications; 
▪nature and extent of mobile interface; 
6

▪level of customer satisfaction; 
▪size of customer base and level of user adoption and usage; 
▪brand awareness and reputation; 
▪ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; 
▪ domain expertise with respect to our targeted verticals; and 
▪ability to leverage a common technology platform and business strategy. 
We believe that we compete favorably on the factors described above. However, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors. 
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our core solutions and Value+ services. As of January 31, 2018, we had twelve issued United States patents that directly relate to our technology and expire between 2026 and 2033. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. 
We registered “AppFolio,” "MyCase" and "RentLinx" and certain other marks as trademarks in the United States and several other jurisdictions. We also filed trademark applications and renewals in the United States and certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include “appfolioinc.com,” “appfolio.com,” “mycase.com” and similar variations. We also license software from third parties for use in our solutions, including open source software and other software available on standard commercial terms. 
We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our software solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. 
Seasonality
We experience limited seasonality in our Value+ services revenue, primarily with respect to the screening services we provide to our property manager customers. These customers historically have processed fewer applications for new tenants during the fourth quarter holiday season; therefore, revenue associated with our screening services and new tenant applications typically declines in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result of this seasonal decline in revenue, we have typically experienced slower sequential revenue growth or a sequential decline in revenue in the fourth quarter of each of our most recent fiscal years. We expect this seasonality to continue in the foreseeable future.
Segments
We have one operating and reportable segment consisting of various products and services that are all related to our cloud-based business management software and Value + platforms for various vertical markets. For our revenue, net loss and total assets, see our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
