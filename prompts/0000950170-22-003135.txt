Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company dedicated to improving the vision of patients following cataract surgery. Our proprietary RxSight Light Adjustable Lens system (“RxSight system”), comprised of our RxSight Light Adjustable Lens (“LAL”), RxSight Light Delivery Device (“LDD”) and accessories, is the first and only commercially available intraocular lens (“IOL”) technology that enables doctors to customize and optimize visual acuity for patients after cataract surgery. Our LAL is made of proprietary photosensitive material that changes shape in response to specific patterns of ultraviolet (“UV”) light generated by our LDD. With the RxSight system, the surgeon performs a standard cataract procedure to implant the LAL, determines refractive error with patient input after healing is complete, and then uses the LDD to modify the LAL with the exact amount of visual correction needed to achieve the patient’s desired vision outcomes. Alternative IOL technologies, in contrast, are not adjustable following the cataract procedure and therefore require patients to make pre-operative choices about their visual preferences, which can often result in patient dissatisfaction when visual outcomes fail to meet expectations. We designed our RxSight system to maximize patient and doctor satisfaction through superior visual outcomes. In the pivotal study that formed the basis for our FDA approval, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity for our LAL was 70.1%. This compares favorably to the results of pivotal studies with similar study designs and patient populations that supported FDA approval of Alcon’s Acrysof Toric (38.4%), and J&J’s Tecnis Toric (43.6%). We began commercializing our solution in the United States in the third quarter of 2019 and are focused on establishing the RxSight system as the standard of care for premium IOL procedures. As of December 31, 2021, we had an installed base of 206 LDDs in ophthalmology practices and since our inception though December 31, 2021, surgeons have performed almost 17,000 surgeries with our RxSight system.
 Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the world, with approximately 29.7 million cataract surgeries performed worldwide in 2021, including 4.7 million in the United States. A cataract is a loss of transparency in the normally clear lens of the eye that can cause blurry or hazy vision, significantly interfering with daily activities and affecting quality of life. Cataracts increase in prevalence with age and develop in approximately 50% of individuals by age 60 affecting both eyes 80% to 90% of the time and requiring surgery to restore vision in most cases. During cataract surgery, the patient’s natural lens is replaced with a clear artificial lens called an intraocular lens (“IOL”). There are two broad categories of IOLs used, conventional and premium. Based on the category of IOL used, cataracts surgeries can be differentiated as either conventional or premium procedures. In conventional cataract surgery, patients receive conventional monofocal IOLs that are designed to provide vision at one distance, and do not correct for corneal astigmatism and presbyopia. Nearly all conventional IOL patients therefore will need spectacles to attain their best vision after surgery. With premium cataract surgery, patients receive premium IOLs designed to correct for corneal astigmatism and/or presbyopia and therefore to provide for reduced spectacle dependence. Because 60% of cataract patients rate being spectacle free after cataract surgery as extremely important, we believe the premium IOL market is underpenetrated. During 2021, according to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report (the “Market Scope 2021 Premium Report”), premium IOL procedures performed were approximately 15% of all procedures performed in the United States and approximately 9% of the total procedures performed worldwide. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, total worldwide procedures increased approximately 36% from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacting procedures in 2020. Revenue for the premium IOL market was estimated to be $1.5 billion, or 31% of the total IOL market for 2021, due to higher lens pricing and increased procedures from 2020. In addition, the premium IOL market is projected to grow significantly faster as worldwide cataract procedure volumes return to pre COVID-19 levels. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, global premium cataract procedures are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10% from 2021 to 2026, however revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% from $1.5 billion in 2021 to a $2.7 billion in 2026 as compared to a 4% CAGR revenue growth for the conventional IOL market. Premium cataract procedures are between 10 and 15 times more profitable for the doctors and ophthalmology practices than conventional cataract procedures. The premium IOL market is also less impacted by changes in reimbursement rates because patients in most markets are required to pay out-of-pocket to cover the full or incremental costs of premium cataract procedures (depending on the country), while healthcare payors typically only cover the full cost of conventional cataract procedures.
 We believe that the premium cataract surgery market remains underpenetrated due to both doctors’ reluctance to recommend premium IOL offerings to the full universe of eligible patients and patients’ confusion in assessing

the tradeoffs associated with the wide range of competitive premium IOL offerings. We believe competitive premium IOL offerings often cannot deliver on patient expectations with respect to the patient’s ability to see at near and intermediate distances without reliance on spectacles. Once a patient has selected a competitive premium IOL, the surgeon must rely on a series of pre-operative diagnostic tests and predictive formulae to choose a lens that delivers the accuracy and outcomes desired by the patient. According to published clinical data from the pivotal studies of competitive premium IOL technologies, the percentage of patients that achieved 20/20 vision with both eyes at all distances was only 40%. As a result, doctors often lack confidence with competitive premium IOL offerings given their inability to meet patients’ expectations consistently.
 We designed our RxSight system to address the shortcomings of existing competitive premium IOL technologies and provide a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes. In contrast to competitive premium IOL solutions, for which patients are required (before surgery) to specify their visual priorities and willingness to accept optical trade-offs associated with those choices, our RxSight system offers peace of mind that patients can iterate their final vision characteristics with customized post-surgical adjustments. The surgeon first performs a standard cataract implant procedure, replacing the patient’s natural lens with the LAL. Approximately three weeks post cataract surgery, after healing has occurred, the patient undergoes a standard post-operative refraction to determine the refractive error and the prescription required to give the patient the best vision. This prescription is much like that used for spectacle lenses, but instead is used as an input to the LDD. To adjust the LAL, the patient is positioned at the LDD for a treatment that lasts between approximately 30 seconds and 2.5 minutes, depending on the required prescription. The patient returns after approximately three to five days, at which time they can undergo another refraction and adjustment, if needed, to “dial in” their best vision. Once the patient and the doctor are satisfied, then the adjustment is locked in for life with another light treatment. While up to three post-surgical adjustment visits are offered by the doctor, in our pivotal clinical study, patients had an average of 1.6 adjustments. While many patients choose to have both eyes corrected for distance, approximately 75% elect for what is called a blended vision approach that takes advantage of the LAL’s depth of focus to deliver a customized blended vision solution. By titrating the correction for near, intermediate or far in each eye, this approach provides the highest rates of excellent vision with both eyes at all distances.
We believe the RxSight system offers significant advantages over other commercially available conventional and premium IOLs that will drive its broad adoption. The primary benefits of our solution include:
 •first and only IOL that can be customized after surgery and healing of the eye; 
 •provides doctors and patients with confidence in better visual outcomes and a low risk of side effects; 
 •provides a precise treatment range and excellent vision rates with both eyes at all distances; 
 •uses a familiar industry standard IOL implantation procedure and an IOL adjustment procedure that is easy-to-learn; 
 •allows patients to preview their vision selection prior to LAL adjustment; and 
 •provides a premium IOL alternative that can help doctors grow their practice revenues and profits. 
 Our RxSight system has FDA approval for the reduction of residual astigmatism to improve uncorrected visual acuity after removal of the cataractous natural lens by phacoemulsification and implantation of the intraocular lens in the capsular bag, in adult patients with pre-existing corneal astigmatism of > 0.75 diopters and without pre-existing macular disease. Our system has also received the CE mark and marketing approval in Mexico for improving uncorrected visual acuity by adjusting the LAL power to correct residual postoperative refractive error, including for -2.0 to + 2.0 diopters of sphere and -3.0 to -0.50 diopters of cylinder and by changing lens curvature to introduce controlled amounts of spherical aberration (+/- 1 micron) and center near add (up to 2.0 diopters). We are currently focusing our commercial efforts in the United States. Our commercial strategy is focused on a “razor and razor blade” model through which we aim to drive new customer adoption, which generally begins with the sale of an LDD, and then help the customer incorporate the LAL into their practice to drive utilization and premium procedure growth. We believe this commercial strategy over time may provide a degree of predictability in terms of our commercial growth and a consumable revenue stream from sales of our LALs. We are currently focused on driving adoption with surgeons performing a high volume of premium cataract procedures. According to the 2021 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report approximately 10,000 surgeons perform cataract surgeries in the United

States and we estimate that as many as 3,000 surgeons performed approximately 70% to 80% of the premium procedures in the United States in 2021. We believe this provides an attractive and concentrated market opportunity addressable with a focused sales force. We currently employ a sales team that, as of December 31, 2021, includes 18 LDD sales personnel and 14 LAL sales personnel, and a group of 55 clinical specialists, field service, customer service, and marketing personnel. While we intend to initially focus our growing commercial efforts in the United States, in the future, we may selectively pursue commercial expansion in Canada, Japan, Europe, Australia or other geographies with significant market opportunity for premium IOLs.
Our near-term research and development activities are focused on enhancements to the RxSight system to improve the patient and doctor experience, expand the range of patients that can be treated as well as expand its indications. We believe that over time, our adjustable lens solution can be used to address a broad range of cataract surgery patients, including those that would otherwise elect for a conventional cataract procedure today. Our vision is that a vast majority of the patients and surgeons that undergo or perform a cataract surgery procedure, will elect to use our RxSight technology that provides a customizable solution delivering better visual outcomes.
Our success factors
We are focused on establishing our RxSight system as the standard of care for premium cataract surgery and providing a solution that doctors and patients can trust to deliver optimal visual outcomes without unwanted visual side effects. We believe our key success factors include:
•First and only commercially available IOL technology that allows customization and optimization of patient vision after surgery. We have developed our RxSight system over the last 20 years and have incorporated expertise and proprietary technologies across multiple disciplines, including optics, material science, chemistry, software and hardware engineering. Our LAL uses a proprietary silicone formulation that enables changing the mechanical and optical properties of the lens following implantation. Unlike other currently available IOLs, the vast majority of which are made from acrylic, the LAL contains both long and short silicone polymers, along with other photo-active compounds that enable permanent polymerization of the silicone post-operatively using UV light. Our LDD uses proprietary software and algorithms to deliver a short UV exposure treatment that polymerizes specific portions of the lens that allows doctors to adjust spherical and cylindrical refraction in 0.25 diopter increments, similar to the adjustment increments used to refract patients for glasses or contact lenses, as well as in other refractive procedures like LASIK. We believe our commitment to innovation, extensive technical capabilities, and world-class engineering teams will enable us to deliver future product enhancements and expansion of indications for our platform. Certain aspects of our RxSight system are protected by our portfolio of patents. As of January 31, 2022, we owned or exclusively in-licensed approximately 24 issued U.S. patents, 19 issued patents outside the United States, 10 pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications, 20 pending foreign patent applications and four pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications. 
 •Superior visual outcomes and premium IOL experience for patients. In the pivotal study that formed the basis for our FDA approval, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity for our LAL was 70.1%. This compares favorably to the results of pivotal studies with similar study designs and patient populations that supported FDA approval of Alcon’s Acrysof Toric (38.4%), and J&J’s Tecnis Toric (43.6%). Additionally, LAL patients reported a low rate of glare or halo, visual side effects that are frequently reported with presbyopia correcting IOLs. We believe our system also delivers a premium experience for patients by shifting patient decisions from before surgery (after which they are difficult to change) to after surgery, when patients work with their doctors to dial-in their optimal visual acuity, thereby lowering the likelihood for remedial or secondary corrective procedures. We believe these qualities will lead to broad commercial adoption of the RxSight system.
 •Attractive value proposition for doctors. We believe the RxSight system provides a myriad of benefits for doctors that will help facilitate adoption and incorporation into their clinical practice. The clinical benefit of “dialing-in” to achieve superior visual outcomes after the procedure will give doctors more confidence to recommend a premium IOL solution that can meet patients’ expectations. This can provide economic benefits by empowering doctors to grow their practice by increasing the number of premium IOL surgeries, which generally have higher revenue and profit margin than conventional procedures. Over the longer term, we also believe that using our technology can help drive patient 


referrals to the practice. We designed and are offering our LDD at a price to create an attractive return on investment for our customers over a reasonable period of time. For example, an online, third-party survey by Haffey & Company of 15 practices that use the RxSight system revealed that LAL procedures were sourced from all other categories of other IOLs and were well balanced across monofocal, astigmatism-correcting and presbyopia-correcting IOLs. Based on an average of 16 LAL cases per month at these practices, a payback period of five months for the purchase price of the LDD was seen. Using lower national average selling prices for astigmatism-correcting and presbyopia-correcting IOLs and a monthly procedural volume of only six cases resulted in a payback period of 18 months for such practices. Following the payback period, practices continue to reap the financial benefits of converting patients to the higher revenue RxSight procedure. Our RxSight system also offers several practice and workflow benefits. Because the RxSight is a versatile lens that can be used to address a wide variety of different patients and their needs, we believe doctors can use the LAL as their primary and first choice of premium IOL, rather than having to choose between, and hold in inventory, different IOLs to address different patient needs. The RxSight implantation procedure is a familiar industry standard IOL implantation procedure and the light adjustment procedure is easy to learn, which we believe will help lower barriers to adoption.
 •Large and growing IOL market underpenetrated within broader IOL industry. Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the United and worldwide, with over 29.7 million procedures performed globally and 4.7 million procedures performed in the United States in 2021. While 60% of cataract patients rate being spectacle free after cataract surgery as extremely important, in 2021 premium procedures were 9% and 15% of the total procedures performed worldwide and in the United States, respectively. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, revenue for premium IOLs was approximately $562 million in the United States and $1.5 billion worldwide in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 12%, respectively, through 2026. We believe our RxSight system addresses key limitations that have slowed adoption of premium cataract procedures and premium IOL market growth. We believe there is an opportunity to not only gain share in the premium IOL segment of the market but also increase penetration of premium IOLs in the broader IOL market, by converting doctors as well as patients with astigmatism currently electing for conventional cataract surgery. 
 •Primarily out-of-pocket, cash-pay procedure, which we believe makes the premium IOL market less sensitive to reimbursement. The premium IOL market benefits from well-established and attractive payment dynamics with, we believe, limited reimbursement risk. In the United States, healthcare payors typically reimburse the surgeon and facility fee, which represent a fraction of the total procedure cost, while patients pay the surgeon an additional fee, which accounts for a significantly larger component of the total cost. Patients have traditionally demonstrated a willingness to pay the incremental out-of-pocket fee to achieve differentiated visual outcomes associated with premium IOLs and premium-cash pay ophthalmic procedures, such as LASIK, are well established. Given the unique benefits and advantages of the RxSight system, we believe customers will find our value proposition to be compelling and affordable in the context of other premium IOL offerings available today. 
 •Concentrated potential customer base, addressable with a focused commercial organization. We are initially focusing our commercial efforts in the United States and on driving adoption with doctors performing a high volume of premium cataract procedures. According to the 2021 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report approximately 10,000 surgeons perform cataract surgeries today in the United States, and we estimate that as many as 3,000 surgeons performed approximately 70% to 80% of premium IOL procedures in the United States in 2021. We believe this concentrated nature of the premium IOL customer base is easily addressable with a focused sales force and lends itself well to our “razor and razor blade” business model, which is focused on winning customers and driving increased utilization of our LALs. Our direct sales team currently includes 18 LDD sales personnel, 14 LAL sales personnel, and a group of over 55 clinical specialists, field service, customer service, and marketing personnel that covering the United States.
 •Proven management team with a track record of establishing adoption of multiple innovative technology platforms in ophthalmology. Our leadership team has extensive experience in scaling ophthalmology businesses, guiding them through the development, approval, launch and commercialization of transformative medical devices. The team is well complemented by leaders with 


extensive experience in the full product lifecycle including designing and developing new technologies, collaborating closely with regulatory agencies, identifying the appropriate path to market and subsequently attracting and effectively managing sales and marketing talent. Members of our team have previously worked with leading ophthalmology medical technology companies including Chiron, IntraLase Inc., eyeonics Inc. and LenSx Lasers Inc.
 Our growth strategies
Our vision is that a vast majority of the patients and doctors that undergo or perform a cataract surgery procedure will elect to use our RxSight technology that provides a customizable solution delivering better visual outcomes. Our growth strategies to achieve this vision include:
 •Strategically expanding our salesforce and marketing activities. We launched the RxSight system in the third quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we have grown our commercial team to include 18 LDD sales personnel, 14 LAL sales personnel, and a group of over 55 clinical specialists, field service, customer service, and marketing personnel. Our LDD sales personnel are focused on selling the LDD and establishing doctor relationships, and our clinical specialists, field service and customer service personnel are responsible for installing and training on the use of the LDD, and the LAL sales personnel are focused on continuing fostering patient and doctor education, increasing penetration in each account and assisting with patient flow processes for our RxSight system. While we believe a large proportion of our target market is concentrated within a group of high volume cataract surgeons and addressable with a focused commercial effort, we plan to continue to add highly qualified personnel to our commercial organization, with a strategic mix of sales personnel, clinical specialists, to drive further awareness and penetration within our target doctor base performing premium cataract surgeries. As our customer base continues to grow, we also expect to accelerate marketing initiatives and professional education, including training on best practices and techniques.
 •Establishing new customers and growing our installed base of LDDs. We believe our novel technology provides a differentiated value proposition to doctors as well as patients and provides us the opportunity to both gain market share in the premium IOL market as well as increase the penetration of premium IOL surgery in the broader cataract surgery market. Our initial focus is to grow our market share by winning customers within the as many of the 3,000 cataract surgeons that perform a high volume of premium IOL procedures in the United States. To do so, we aim to convert these doctors to the RxSight system by highlighting the clinical, economic and workflow benefits of our solution over other premium IOL technologies. We also intend to address the broader universe of the remaining approximately 7,000 doctors that may perform only a small portion of premium procedures or only perform conventional cataract surgery. We will address this customer universe by promoting broader awareness at industry conferences and tradeshows and highlighting the practice building and economic benefits of our solution, its ease of use, as well as the improved visual outcomes. We are investing in professional education, additional clinical studies and registries that expand our evidence base, facilitating peer-to-peer dialogue and forums and communicating the benefits of our technology through marketing initiatives, publications and podium presentations. We believe that as more patients and doctors gain confidence in our technology, this will drive broader adoption, awareness and confidence amongst the industry to adopt, use and recommend our technology.
 •Increasing the utilization of our LALs by empowering doctors to grow their practices. Following winning a customer account, we aim to drive increased utilization of our LALs by helping our customers build their practices. We believe this will ultimately result in a growing consumable revenue stream from sales of our LALs. Our team of clinical specialists, field service and customer service personnel are focused on helping our customers be successful with our solution. In addition to personnel support, we provide doctors with marketing materials, such as patient brochures, literature and digital content for website and social media promotions. We also provide ongoing training to doctors on new technology features and developments and education on the benefits of our solution for patients.
 •Investing in system enhancements to meet the evolving needs of doctors as well as patients.  We will continue to enhance our RxSight system to improve the patient and doctor experience, which we expect will help drive adoption. Since our commercial launch, we have implemented a number of impactful product enhancements across our hardware and software platforms, including increasing the range of 


available LAL powers, modifying the LAL to improve image quality, reducing the margin of residual refractive error, developing new UV spectacles with improved aesthetics and usability and adding a photosensitive anterior layer to help protect the lens from unwanted UV exposure. Our near-term product enhancement efforts are focused on improving ease of use, functionality, cost and efficiency. For example, we are at an advanced stage of development with a working prototype of a lower cost version of the LDD, which we believe will help increase its affordability to lower volume premium IOL practices and facilitate broader adoption across the ophthalmic surgery community. It is anticipated that this lower cost LDD would require a 180 day PMA Supplement for approval in the United States and will require CE Mark certification through a notified body for registration in the European Union.
 •Expanding the RxSight system’s indications to address additional patients and procedures. We believe our RxSight system is a platform technology that can be used to address a substantial portion of the IOL market. Since our initial FDA approval in November 2017, we have received eighteen supplemental approvals that enable the RxSight system to meet evolving customer needs. These approvals include increasing the range of LAL powers, treatment of lower amounts of residual astigmatism, allowing an optional third refractive adjustment, the introduction of ActivShield to provide additional UV protection from ambient UV sources and improved surgical tools. 
 •Growing our commercial operations in international markets. While our current commercial focus is on the large opportunity within the United States, we believe the RxSight system offers compelling benefits for the large population of cataract patients in international markets. According to the 2021 Premium Cataract Surgery Market Report, over 70% of the premium IOL procedures in 2021 were outside the United States. Our system has CE Mark approval and approval in Mexico for improving uncorrected visual acuity by adjusting the LAL power to correct residual postoperative refractive error. We may selectively pursue commercial expansion in these or other geographies that accept these approvals in the future, with a priority on markets where we see significant potential opportunity. New approvals may also be sought in large cataract markets with more complex regulatory processes in Asia. 
 •Scaling our business to achieve cost and production efficiencies. We expect to realize operating leverage through increased scale efficiencies as our commercial operations grow. We have executed a number of design and manufacturing process improvements to streamline both LAL and LDD production, and have developed a lower cost to manufacture LDD, which has been submitted to the FDA for approval. We are also concurrently executing on our strategy to optimize our diverse supply chain and to develop second sources from less expensive suppliers. We anticipate that the combination of these strategies will drive margin improvement in the future when introduced into production and offered for sale. 
 Our market and industry
Overview of cataracts
Cataracts are an irreversible and progressive ophthalmic condition in which the eye’s natural lens loses its original transparency and increasingly obstructs or otherwise interferes with the passage of light to the retina, leading to loss of vision and (in advanced cases) to blindness. While there are multiple causes of cataracts, most are age-related. Cataracts affect approximately 50% of all adults by the age of 60 with prevalence continuing to increase with age. As cataracts progress, they also can increase the eye’s sensitivity to light, particularly at night. Cataract

formations occur at different rates but affect both eyes in most cases. According to the National Eye Institute, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide, despite the availability of effective surgical treatment.
 


Cataract patients are also often burdened by other common visual disorders, such as refractive error and presbyopia. Refractive errors, caused by mismatches in the focusing power of the anterior structure of the eye (cornea and lens) that prevents proper focus of light onto the retina, includes myopia (near-sightedness, or the inability to see clearly at distance), hyperopia (far-sightedness or the inability to see clearly at close up) and astigmatism (distorted vision at all distances). Astigmatism generally is caused by an imperfection in curvature of the cornea. Presbyopia typically occurs in middle age and is caused by the loss of accommodation (flexibility) of the lens of the eye, resulting in the gradual loss of the eyes’ ability to focus on nearby objects.
 Amongst the common visual disorders, cataracts are unique in that they cannot be treated non-invasively with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Most patients are typically diagnosed with cataracts during a routine annual visit to their optometrist (“OD”) or ophthalmologist. Once a patient has been diagnosed with cataracts, eyeglasses may help improve vision temporarily; however, surgery is usually recommended to replace the affected natural lens and the OD may refer the patient to a cataract surgeon.
Overview of cataract surgery
Cataract surgery is the most common surgical procedure in the world. In 2021, according to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, 29.7 million cataract surgeries were performed globally, of which 4.7 million were performed in the United States. The number of cataract surgeries performed globally and in the United States is expected to continue to expand as the population over 60 years old is expected to double by 2050, increasing from 962 million (13% of the total population) in 2017 to two billion (21% of the total population) by 2050.
Cataract surgery involves replacement of the patient’s natural cloudy lens with a clear artificial IOL. Cataract surgery is often bifurcated into two procedure categories, conventional and premium, delineated by the type of lens used during surgery. In conventional cataract surgery, the patient receives a monofocal IOL implant, which is designed to provide vision at one pre-defined distance without correction for other visual problems that often affect cataract surgery patients such as corneal astigmatism and presbyopia. Nearly all patients undergoing conventional cataract surgery will need to rely on glasses to achieve the best distance, intermediate and near vision. Premium cataract surgery involves the use of premium IOLs which are designed also to correct for corneal astigmatism and/or presbyopia. The most commonly used premium IOLs in the market today include multifocal, EDOF and toric lenses. These product offerings reduce the need for spectacles relative to conventional IOLs, but still impose trade-offs with respect to their ability to provide spectacle-free near, intermediate and distance vision.
When preparing patients for cataract surgery, surgeons must have a comprehensive understanding of available IOL options and how to best match a patient to the technology that fits their priorities. Patient decisions are based on a number of factors and tend to be heavily influenced by surgeon recommendations as well as the individual patient’s motivation for spectacle independence as well as willingness to tolerate side effects. During an initial consultation, cataract surgeons often ask patients to fill out a survey regarding their vision experiences and expectations to determine if the patient is a good candidate for a premium IOLs. If the patient is deemed to be a

candidate, the surgeon then helps select the appropriate IOL based upon the patient’s lifestyle and therefore the type of vision they most value (i.e., near, intermediate or distance). Significant time is often required to educate patients on the various trade-offs with respect to the visual outcomes associated with each type of premium IOL. Following the patient consultation, surgery is usually scheduled within several weeks or months.
 Prior to surgery, the surgeon will have the patient’s eyes measured using one or more diagnostic devices that help the surgeon predict the lens focusing power best suited to achieve the optimal postoperative outcome. Focusing power, expressed in diopters (D), refers to how a lens focuses light to a point (spherical power) or a line (cylindrical or astigmatic power). Accurately predicting lens power is critical to reducing postoperative residual refractive error and delivering the best possible visual outcome.
 Once surgery begins, the clouded lens is usually removed through a process known as phacoemulsification. During phacoemulsification, an ophthalmic surgeon makes a small surgical incision in the cornea and inserts an ultrasonic probe that breaks up, or emulsifies, the clouded lens while a hollow needle removes the pieces of the lens. After the cataract is removed, the surgeon inserts the replacement IOL through the same surgical incision. In the United States, cataract surgery is commonly performed in the outpatient setting, such as an Ambulatory Surgery Center (“ASC”), by an ophthalmologist specializing in cataract surgery and often requires only 5 to 15 minutes to complete the procedure. Typically, the patient returns a day after surgery to have their eye evaluated and ensure healing is underway. After approximately one month, patients that received a conventional lens usually return to their optometrist to be fitted for glasses. Patients that selected premium IOLs but are unsatisfied with their visual results may be fitted for glasses or elect for a secondary, remedial procedure.
 Illustrated below is an eye before cataract surgery. In Image #1 the surgeon has made a small surgical incision in the cornea and has inserted an ultrasonic probe to break up the clouded lens while the hollow needle (at the tip) removes the pieces of the lens. Image #2 illustrates the eye after the cataract is removed and the surgeon inserts the replacement IOL through the same surgical incision. Image #3 illustrates the new lens before the surgical incision is closed.
 


In the United States, a healthcare payor (primarily Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)) typically provides reimbursement of approximately $500 for a surgeon fee and approximately $1,000 for a facility fee, which includes a conventional IOL. Accounting for reductions in CMS reimbursement and for inflation, reimbursement has decreased two thirds since 1991. The surgeon fee covers all pre-operative cataract testing, the cataract operation and follow-up care for three months. In premium cataract surgery the healthcare payor (primarily CMS) also reimburses the same surgeon and facility fees, but the patient pays the surgeon an additional fee of approximately $1,500 for a toric IOL and an average of up to $6,500 for other premium lenses, which includes the cost of the premium IOL.
Our market opportunity
In 2021, conventional cataract surgery represented 90% of procedures worldwide and 85% of procedures in the United States; however, revenue for the premium IOL market is approximately 31% of the total IOL market, due to higher lens pricing, and is expected to grow significantly faster. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, the conventional IOL market revenues were approximately $4.8 billion worldwide in 2021 and is expected

to grow to $6.8 billion in 2026, a CAGR of 7.2%. In 2021, premium IOL revenue was approximately $562 million in the United States and $1.5 billion worldwide and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% and 12%, respectively, through 2026. The premium cataract surgery market is expected to grow at a meaningfully higher rate than the conventional cataract surgery market due to a number of factors including the growing number of patients who prefer to be spectacle-free post-surgery, technological innovations in premium IOLs, increased access to healthcare and rising disposable income. Premium cataract procedures are also between 10 and 15 times more profitable for doctors and ophthalmology practices than conventional cataract procedures and less impacted by changes in reimbursement because patients are required to pay out-of-pocket to cover the full or incremental costs of premium cataract procedures (depending on the country), while healthcare payors typically cover the full cost of conventional cataract procedures.
 We believe there is an opportunity to not only gain share in the premium IOL segment of the market but also increase penetration of premium IOLs in the broader IOL market, by converting doctors and patients currently electing for conventional cataract surgery. While 60% of cataract patients rate being spectacle free after cataract surgery as extremely important, in 2021, premium IOLs represented approximately 9% and 15% of the procedures worldwide and in the United States, respectively. We believe that the premium cataract surgery market remains underpenetrated due to both doctors’ reluctance to recommend premium IOL offerings to the full universe of eligible patients and patients’ confusion in assessing the tradeoffs associated with the wide range of commercially available premium IOL offerings. Furthermore, we believe current premium IOL offerings often cannot deliver on patient expectations with respect to the patient’s ability to see at near, intermediate and far distances without reliance on spectacles.
 We are currently focused on further driving awareness and penetration of our system in the premium cataract surgery market, and in the near term, are primarily focusing our commercial efforts on our RxSight system within the United States. We believe this is the most compelling market given the large population of individuals above the age of 60 that are covered by health insurance, the concentrated base of cataract surgeons experienced with premium IOL offerings, the high gross domestic product per capita and the favorable US healthcare reimbursement system which has a well-established history of covering a portion of the cost for cataract surgery.
Overview of non-adjustable premium IOLs and their limitations
Premium IOLs are designed to correct for the shortcomings of conventional monofocal lenses by correcting for the additional visual problems of astigmatism and/or presbyopia. Astigmatism occurs when there is imperfection in the curvature of the cornea, resulting in blurred distance and near vision. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of the eyes’ ability to focus on nearby objects. Individuals usually begin to experience the effects of presbyopia in their early 40s.
The two primary categories of alternative premium IOLs are presbyopia-correcting IOLs, which include multifocal and EDOF lenses, and astigmatism-correcting, or toric, lenses. Each type of lens offers its own unique set of benefits but also trade-offs.
•Presbyopia-Correcting IOLs
•Multifocal Lenses. Multifocal lenses have two or more corrective zones, which allow the patient to receive focused light from different distances. Although multifocal lenses provide patients with a wider range of vision compared to the standard monofocal IOLs, multifocal lenses split light across the multiple corrective zones on the lens, sometimes impacting the patient’s visual quality. For example, approximately 2-3 times as many patients who choose a multifocal lens over a monofocal lens experience side effects such as glare and halos, as well as reduced contrast vision, which are especially problematic in dim and low light situations such as driving at night. For some patients these become more pronounced and can lead to explantation (removal of the IOL and replacement with another type of IOL). 
 •EDOF Lenses. Unlike multifocal lenses, EDOF lenses have only one corrective zone; however, they create an elongated focal point that allows for a broader range of vision, although patients will still often require glasses for distance and near vision. EDOF lenses will still typically result in glare and halos, as 


well as reduced contrast vision, although generally less severe than those experienced with multifocal lenses.
• Astigmatism-Correcting or Toric Lenses. Toric lenses correct for astigmatism, a condition in which the cornea is not uniformly curved leading to distortion of near and distance vision. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, approximately 70% of the population has clinically significant astigmatism of 0.5 diopters or more. Corrective toric lenses can provide additional distance, intermediate or near vision correction depending on the power of the lens selected and if their optical design incorporates either multifocal or EDOF features. However, according to the same the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, surgeons only attempt to correct astigmatism approximately 70% of the time and approximately 60% of cases use toric lenses. Survey results on the reason for the low adoption rate include poor precision in correcting astigmatism and the requirement of expensive diagnostic equipment.
 On the two most recently published by the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (the “ESCRS”) clinical trend surveys, 44% of surgeons and 36% of surgeons reported factors that discourage them from offering premium IOLs due to concern over nighttime vision and loss of contrast sensitivity, respectively. A key limitation of alternative premium IOLs is that they cannot be adjusted after the surgery and, as such, require the patient to commit to a desired visual outcome prior to the procedure. However, in discussing vision optimization options with patients ahead of the procedure, it is not easy to demonstrate different visual outcomes to patients with cataracts. Once a premium IOL is selected, another key limitation is the ability of the surgeon to implant the IOL with the level of accuracy required to deliver the patient’s expected outcome. Because the lens power of alternative premium IOLs cannot be changed after implantation, doctors typically spend a great deal of time on preoperative measurements to estimate the most suitable lens power for the patient; however, the same diagnostic tests and predictive formulae used for selecting the spherical power of the premium IOL are also used for conventional IOLs. Additionally, the incision made to remove the cloudy lens and insert the IOL along with the resultant healing process often results in the creation of additional levels of astigmatism, which cannot be predicted with precision before cataract surgery. A separate LASIK procedure is the most common surgical procedure to correct any residual visual errors following the cataract procedure.
We believe that the need to commit to a visual outcome before surgery combined with the limited ability to adjust following the procedure are key factors contributing to the low levels of penetration of premium cataract surgery. When expectations regarding postoperative visual acuity and spectacle independence are not met, patients are often disappointed. As a result, surgeons are often less willing to recommend existing premium IOLs to their patients.
Our solution
We designed our RxSight system to address the shortcomings of existing premium IOL technologies and provide a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes. We began commercializing our solution in the United States in the third quarter of 2019 and are focused on establishing the RxSight system as the standard of care for premium IOL procedures. As of December 31, 2021, we had an installed base of 206 LDDs in ophthalmology practices, and since our inception almost 17,000 surgeries have been performed with our system.
 Overview of the RxSight system
Our RxSight system is the first and only FDA-approved IOL technology that enables doctors to customize and optimize visual acuity for patients after cataract surgery. With the RxSight system, the doctor performs a standard cataract procedure to implant the LAL, determines refractive error with patient input after healing is complete, then

uses the LDD to reshape the LAL to achieve the patients’ desired vision outcomes. Our RxSight system is comprised of two key components, along with other intraoperative and postoperative accessories:
 •RxSight Light Adjustable Lens: The LAL is our proprietary IOL that can be adjusted postoperatively to improve uncorrected visual acuity. Our novel IOL is made of special photosensitive material that changes shape and power when a specific pattern of UV light is delivered from the LDD.
 

•RxSight Light Delivery Device: The LDD is our proprietary office-based light treatment device that delivers UV light in a precisely programmed pattern to induce a predictable change in the shape and refractive properties of the LAL, enabling surgeons to precisely modify the LAL based on the visual correction needed to achieve the patient’s desired vision after cataract surgery. 
 


Our foundational technology
We have developed our RxSight system over the last 20 years and have incorporated expertise and proprietary technologies across multiple disciplines, including optics, material science, chemistry, software and hardware engineering. The proprietary RxSight technology that enables post-operative adjustability is based on the principles of photochemistry. The LAL is made of a photosensitive material that changes shape and power when a specific pattern of UV light is delivered to the LAL.
Our LAL, which we manufacture using our proprietary silicone formulation, leverages the unique material properties of silicone. A silicone molecule consists of an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone, which is a chain of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with an attached side group, which is a pair of organic molecules bonded to each silicon atom in the chain. Through a process called polymerization, silicone monomers (short chain molecules) are reacted together to form silicone polymers (long chain molecules), which may be cross-linked at multiple points resulting in three-dimensional, rather than linear, structures. By varying chain length, attached side group and cross-linking design, silicone polymers can be tailored to have unique properties, leading to their broad use across a wide array of applications. We have developed a novel application of silicone to optimize the mechanical and optical properties of IOLs in order to improve vision in patients following cataract surgery.
To create the LAL, we use a composition of silicone polymers and monomers, the latter which we call “macromers”, mixed with photo-active molecules and other compounds. The initial composition of our lens material

is a viscous liquid that is thermally cured in a lens mold. Thermal curing and photopolymerization use temperature and ultraviolet light, respectively, to initiate and propagate a polymerization reaction. To avoid polymerizing the macromers in the composition, the thermal curing is performed at a low temperature. The partial polymerization of the LAL results in a solid but soft silicone lens, leaving the photosensitive macromers unpolymerized and distributed throughout the lens. While the resulting lens is optically clear, the macromers and photo-active molecules remain free to continuously move within the lens.
After packaging and sterilization, the LAL is ready to be implanted as part of a standard cataract surgical procedure to replace the patient’s natural lens. Once wound healing is complete, a short exposure of UV light is applied to the LAL to adjust the refractive properties of the lens. When the UV light is directed to a specific portion of the lens, the exposed macromers in that portion of the lens are polymerized and become stationary. This creates an excess concentration of free macromers in the unexposed portion of the lens and sets up a diffusion gradient over which the unpolymerized macromers move from the concentrated area to the less concentrated area. Over the next one to two days, the unpolymerized macromers redistribute across the lens to achieve a uniform distribution. The redistribution of the macromers causes the exposed portion of the lens to swell relative to the unexposed portion of the lens, enabling refractive power change.
The movement of the macromers causes a highly predictable change in the curvature of the lens. If the central portion of the lens is exposed to UV light, unpolymerized macromers in the periphery of the lens move into the central portion. As a result, the central portion of the lens swells, creating a lens shape for correction of hyperopia. Conversely, if the periphery of the lens is exposed to UV light, unpolymerized macromers in the central portion of the lens migrate into the periphery. As a result, the periphery of the lens swells, creating a lens shape for correction of myopia. In addition to spherical correction for myopia or hyperopia, customized cylinder adjustments along any axis of the lens can be targeted to correct for astigmatism.
The table below illustrates the photopolymerization process that results in the change to the curvature of the lens:



To achieve the desired refractive change in the LAL, our LDD uses proprietary software and algorithms to deliver a short UV exposure treatment that polymerizes specific portions of the lens according to a predefined pattern of light, called a nomogram. Nomograms allow for adjustment of spherical and cylindrical refraction in 0.25 diopter increments, like the adjustment increments used to refract patients for glasses or contact lenses, as well as in other refractive procedures like LASIK, which has similar refractive accuracy. Designed for placement in the doctor’s office, the LDD is a combination of a standard slit lamp and a digital light projector. The slit lamp portion allows the doctor to see inside the patient’s eye and align the light beam with the LAL. The digital light projector portion projects an image onto the LAL using DLP technology that has approximately 250,000 micro mirrors that are electronically activated to represent an image stored in memory.
Each UV light treatment consumes only a portion of the macromers in the lens, allowing the LAL to be adjusted multiple times. This process can be repeated up to 3 times over a period of several weeks, until the patient and

doctor are satisfied. The entire lens is then polymerized to provide a stable correction. After adjustment light treatments are completed, one or two lock-in light treatments are applied to consume all remaining macromers and photo-active compounds. After the final lock-in treatment, the lens power can no longer be adjusted.
Our approach
With the RxSight system, the surgeon first performs a standard cataract implant procedure, replacing the patients’ natural lens with the LAL. Following the surgery, after a healing period of 2 to 3 weeks, the patient returns to the doctor’s office and undergoes a standard post-operative refraction. Using a traditional phoropter and vision chart, the clinician determines the refractive error and the prescription required to give the patient the best vision. However, rather than giving the patient a prescription for glasses, the clinician inputs the prescription into the LDD’s graphical user interface. The patient’s eye is then dilated, and a contact lens is applied to the eye when they are seated in front of the LDD for a light treatment. Based on the prescription input, the LDD generates a programmed, predetermined exposure of UV light. For a period of between 30 seconds and 2.5 minutes, the light painlessly and non-invasively re-shapes the LAL IOL in the eye, to correct the measured refractive error. The entire procedure takes approximately 3 to 5 minutes. The patient then returns approximately three to five days later for additional possible light treatments to adjust their vision as desired or to lock-in the lens. Although a patient can receive up to three adjustments, the average number of adjustments in our clinical trial was 1.6.
The RxSight system enables a fully interactive and iterative process to optimize visual acuity with patients able to compare possible vision outcomes based on their unique preferences and lifestyle requirements before selecting a final prescription for their adjustable lenses. In clinical practice since FDA approval, approximately two thirds of patients undergoing multiple adjustments have requested a change from their original spherical target highlighting the importance of adjustability and customization. From the time of surgery until 24 hours after the LAL is locked in, the patient is required to wear ultraviolet (UV) light protective glasses, as unprotected exposure to light can cause uncontrolled changes in the LAL. The patient may remove the glasses for sleeping, showering and applying eye drops as long as they are not exposed to sunlight.
Blended vision approach with RxSight
In clinical practice, doctors often use the enhanced accuracy and precision of the LAL, as well the ability to customize the correction in each eye after surgery, to improve upon the commonly used blended vision approach to presbyopia treatment. Blended vision (sometimes referred to as monovision or mini-monovision) is commonly selected by presbyopic patients without cataracts as a means to achieve spectacle independence. When used with contact lenses or LASIK, the vision in one eye is corrected more for far-distance, while the other eye is corrected more for near and intermediate distance. This approach is also commonly employed in conventional (monofocal) cataract surgery patients, with nearly 30% of patients receiving blended vision, about three times the rate for presbyopia correcting IOLs. While blended vision using conventional monofocal IOLs can provide improved near and intermediate vision for patients, it is susceptible to the same limitations of accuracy and precision as these IOLs have for distance vision, particularly for astigmatism correction. In addition, patients are very sensitive to which eye is used for near, as well as the difference in focusing power between the two eyes, neither of which can be fully evaluated prior to cataract surgery due to the presence of reduced vision (from the cataract). For all these reasons, doctors often stagger surgery in the two eyes to evaluate outcomes in the first before proceeding to the second.
We believe the LAL offers a number of potential advantages when taking a blended vision approach. First, because the LAL is going to be adjusted postoperatively, there is no refractive benefit to delaying surgery on the second eye. Doctors often choose to perform surgery in each eye within a week so that the LALs can be adjusted together to optimize vision with both eyes simultaneously. Additionally, the LAL reduces residual astigmatism more effectively (even for the most common low levels), which is known to improve blended vision performance. Finally, the LAL’s spherical power can also be adjusted to customize the vision in both the near and distance eye, as well as to minimize the difference between the two. While this difference usually ends up being within a diopter or less, a level that is generally well accepted by patients, there is considerable variability between individuals. For all these reasons, approximately 80% of LAL patients in clinical practice receive some form of blended vision.

Key Benefits for Patients
We believe RxSight offers significant patient benefits relative to other commercially available premium IOLs:
•Superior vision outcomes. In the pivotal study that formed the basis for our FDA approval, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity for our LAL was 70.1%. This compares favorably to the results of pivotal studies with similar study designs and patient populations that supported FDA approval of Alcon’s Acrysof Toric (38.4%), and J&J’s Tecnis Toric (43.6%). 
 •Post-operative customization. In contrast to alternative conventional and premium IOL solutions, our system enables patients to preview and compare possible vision outcomes after surgery based on their unique preferences and lifestyle requirements before they select a final prescription for their adjustable lens. With up to 3 possible light treatments, patients can dial-in their optimal visual acuity through an interactive and iterative process. After the initial light treatment, patients trial their vision for 3 to 5 days. Patients may then return for additional light treatments to adjust their vision as desired or to lock-in the lens. 
 •No increase in glare and halo. Our LALs do not induce higher rates of glare and halos compared to monofocal IOLs. In contrast, multifocal IOLs, generally relied upon to improve near vision, are associated with a higher incidence of unwanted side-effects including reduced contrast sensitivity and increased glare and halos around bright lights. This is true for both multifocal and EDOF IOLs resulting in a significant rate of lens removal of the IOL and replacement with another type of IOL. In FDA studies for the Alcon Panoptix, J&J Symfony and Alcon Vivity lenses, 48.8%, 59.2% and 17.0% of subjects, respectively, reported being bothered by halos postoperatively. 
 •Minimally invasive procedure. The RxSight system can reduce the potential for secondary surgical procedures by correcting residual refractive error after surgery using our office based LDD to shape the LAL. With other premium IOLs, a separate LASIK procedure is generally the only way to correct for residual visual errors following the primary cataract procedure. 
 Key benefits for doctors
We believe RxSight offers significant benefits to doctors relative to other commercially available premium IOLs, the primary benefits of which include the following:
 •Clear value proposition for patients, allowing doctors to build their premium cataract practices. Rather than having to explain to patients the complicated trade-offs with respect to visual outcomes as well as predict refraction before surgery, the surgeon is able to simply tell the patient that their vision will be corrected post-operatively, similar to receiving a pair of glasses. The doctor can also share the clinical results with the patient, which we believe are compelling and give the patient reassurance that the procedure will provide them with the desired results. 
 •Doctor confidence. The clinical benefit of “dialing-in” to achieve superior visual outcomes after the procedure will give doctors more confidence to recommend a premium IOL solution that can meet patients’ expectations. The doctor does not need to decide prior to surgery whether the patient will be particularly sensitive to sub-optimal visual outcomes or side effects (such as glare, halo and loss of contrast). The patient is also unlikely to need a post-operative adjustment such as LASIK to improve the patient’s vision. 
 •Fewer intraoperative measurements. Doctors can spend a great deal of time on intraoperative measurements to better estimate the most suitable lens power to implant since the lens power of existing premium IOLs cannot be changed after implantation. With the RxSight system, surgeons are not as dependent on intraoperative equipment for measurements. Instead, the surgeon can focus on the surgical procedure as residual refractive error can be corrected post-operatively with the LDD adjustment. 
 •Broad application across different patients’ needs. We offer a single IOL that can address a broad range of patient types and needs, while providing a solution that doctors can trust to improve visual outcomes. For example, according to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report, surgeons only use Toric 


lenses in approximately 44% of astigmatism cases, citing poor precision in correcting astigmatism and the requirement of expensive diagnostic equipment. With the ability to correct down to 0.5 diopters of astigmatism in 0.25 diopters steps, the LAL can address a much wider portion of the underserved astigmatic market.
•Satisfied patients leading to potential referrals. While patients need to wear UV protective glasses for a few weeks, and return for adjustment visits, patients ultimately have reduced dependence on glasses and few side effects. Improved visual outcomes can drive patient referrals and increase the number of premium IOL surgeries, which generally have higher revenue and profit margin than conventional procedures. 
 We believe these compelling points of differentiation relative to other commercially available premium IOLs offer key benefits for patients and doctors that will drive broad adoption of the RxSight system.
Clinical results and studies
The LAL has close to twenty years of clinical history, dating back to first human implantation in 2002. Prior to FDA approval at the end of 2017, most of the early clinical work was completed outside the United States. During this period, RxSight demonstrated the safety, long term stability and usability of this technology. These early clinical and commercial results led us to formally initiate US clinical studies. We have completed one phase 2 study and our phase 3 pivotal randomized clinical study.
Phase 2 study
In 2010, we completed an FDA Phase 2 study, where 74 subjects had one eye randomly mistargeted during cataract surgery to either -1.00, 0.00, or +1.00 D. Light treatments were performed to address spherical refractive error and 80.8% of the subject eyes achieved a manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) within 0.50 diopters of target. Three-year follow-up demonstrated excellent long-term safety of the LAL.
Phase 3 pivotal study
Based on these results and the development of light profiles that reduce residual astigmatism, a Phase 3 Pivotal randomized clinical study of 600 subjects was initiated to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of performing light treatments to correct postoperative spherical and cylindrical refractive error. One-year follow-up of subjects from 17 investigational sites was completed on July 20, 2016.
In this study, 391 subjects had the LAL implanted in one eye and the results were compared at the six-month post-operative visit against 193 subjects with a monofocal control IOL implanted in one eye. The LAL met all primary effectiveness endpoints and was approved by the FDA on November 22, 2017 as the first commercially available adjustable IOL. 70.1% of LAL subjects achieved monocular uncorrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 or better compared to 36.3% of the eyes implanted with the monofocal control IOL. In addition to being statistically significantly better than the control IOL, the observed rate of eyes with 20/20 or better uncorrected distance visual acuity was the highest reported for any approved intraocular lens and approximately twice what was observed by the two most popular astigmatism correcting IOLs (38.4% by Alcon’s Acrysof Toric, and 43.6% by J&J’s Tecnis Toric) in similar patient populations in the pivotal studies that led to their approvals by the FDA.
Residual astigmatism was dramatically reduced in the LAL subjects, with 82.4% of LAL subjects having 0.50 diopters or less of manifest astigmatism 6 months after cataract surgery compared to 51.3% of eyes with the monofocal control IOL. This is also significantly better than the performance of both the Acrysof Toric (61.6%) and Tecnis Toric (72.3%) IOLs in similar patient populations in the pivotal studies that led to their approvals by the FDA.
In addition to correcting residual astigmatism, LAL subjects received a correction of residual error in MRSE. 92.1% of LAL subjects were within 0.50 diopters of target (compared to 83.4% observed in the control group). In 2018, the European Database of Cataract Surgery (EUROQUO) showed that of 175,503 subjects, 74.0% of eyes were within 0.50 diopters of target. A survey of 97 LASIK research papers published between 2008 and 2015 showed that out of 65,974 subjects, 90.9% were within 0.50 diopters of target. Thus, the LAL demonstrated superior accuracy to conventional cataract surgery and equivalent performance to LASIK.

During the pivotal study, the residual astigmatism was treated using light treatments that corrected between 0.75 and 2.00 diopters per treatment. After completion of this study, a low astigmatism treatment of 0.50 diopters was developed. Under FDA guidance, we conducted a clinical study of 25 subjects who had exactly 0.50 diopters of residual astigmatism 3 weeks after implantation of the LAL. These subjects were treated with the new light treatment and effectiveness was evaluated 3 months after cataract surgery. On August 7, 2020, the FDA granted us approval to distribute this device improvement based on a mean manifest astigmatism of 0.14 diopters compared to a historical control of 0.40 diopters from a monofocal control IOL.
Reduction in “Outliers”
We believe it is important to interpret the results of clinical studies in the context of the premium lens market. Typically, customers will receive conventional monofocal IOL implantation with a relatively small out of pocket expense. For all premium lenses, however, the patient incurs a significant additional cost, with the expectation of an improved outcome. Therefore, when a patient receives a mediocre or poor outcome (i.e., “outlier” patients), they can be especially disappointed. The three FDA studies presented in Table 1 were conducted to support FDA approval of the listed IOL. While these studies were conducted independently of each other and not as a head-to head comparison, we believe a comparison of the results of these studies is meaningful as they included similar patient populations, study design, follow-up period and study endpoints, as shown in Table 1 below. Importantly, the proportion of these “outlier” patients in the studies was reduced with the LAL with the chance of having significant residual astigmatism (> 1.00 D) or degraded visual acuity (worse than 20/32) ranging from 1.3%-1.5% for the LAL compared to 5.9-16.6% for the other toric IOLs.

Application to blended vision
Light treatment data from the first 2,325 commercially treated LAL’s indicated that nearly 80% of commercial patients received some form of blended vision with a mean target of 1.00 diopters of add in their “near” eye. One of the unique aspects of the LAL is that patients undergo post cataract surgery light treatments during which they can provide feedback to their doctor about their visual preferences as the amount of refractive difference that is well tolerated between the two eyes is very patient dependent. Importantly, LDD data indicates that nearly two thirds of LAL patients elect to change the target refraction in either the near or distance eye compared to the originally selected target treatment, something that would not be possible with a conventional IOL (except through a second

surgical procedure such as LASIK). The graph below shows a histogram of initial and final near add targets in LAL subjects.

Sales and marketing
We sell our RxSight system to cataract doctors and are initially focused on establishing commercial adoption in the United States. We commenced a limited launch in the third quarter of 2019 and full commercial launch in the first quarter of 2020 and are initially focused on surgeons that perform a high volume of premium cataract surgery procedures. The market is relatively concentrated as there are as many as 3,000 cataract surgeons that performed approximately 70% to 80% of the premium cataract procedures in the United States in 2021. These surgeons are typically part of larger ophthalmology practices with multiple cataract surgeons. According to Market Scope, there are approximately 10,000 surgeons that perform cataract surgery in the United States. These surgeons typically have refractive surgery practices offering LASIK and are skilled at selling premium procedures to patients on the basis that they offer better vision outcomes. When establishing new customer relationships with cataract surgeons, we typically enter into a sales contract for our LDD for approximately $120,000 and the LAL for approximately $1,000 and a consignment agreement for our LALs. We are initially focused on selling in the United States, we have also received the CE Mark and regulatory approval in Mexico for improving uncorrected visual acuity by adjusting the LAL power to correct residual postoperative refractive error and may selectively pursue future commercial expansion in Europe or other geographies that represent significant volume opportunity, including key markets in Asia. Market Scope estimates that the United States represents approximately 26% of the global premium IOL procedures and 39% of the global premium IOL market value.
We commercialize our products in the United States through our direct sales team which as of December 31, 2021 includes 18 LDD sales personnel, 14 LAL sales personnel, and a group of over 55 clinical specialists, field service, customer service, and marketing personnel. Our sales personnel generally have relevant experience selling cataract surgery products, as well as medical device service and clinical experience. Our commercial strategy involves a “razor and razor blade” sales model, through which we aim to drive adoption of our RxSight system by increasing our installed base of LDDs, which enable consumable revenues from the sale of our LALs. Our LDD sales personnel, all of whom have previous experience selling IOLs and capital equipment to cataract and refractive surgery practices, are responsible for establishing relationships with doctors and winning new customers. After training at our facility in California our sales personnel are generally proficient to sell the LDD after two to three weeks, assisted, if necessary, by our clinical applications specialists. Our LAL sales personnel are focused on

driving utilization of our LALs by helping customers succeed with our products and build their premium procedure practices. These team members are responsible for educating doctors, training the clinic staff, ophthalmologists and surgeon on selling the benefits of our RxSight system to patients, assisting with patient flow processes for our light adjustable lens system, and providing ongoing customer support. Our clinical specialists will train customers on the use of the LDD and follow initial patients at new customers from implant to completion of LDD treatments, ensuring the surgery center, clinic, ophthalmologists, and surgeons are comfortable with the benefits of our RxSight system. While we believe we can cover this concentrated market with a focused sales force, we plan to continue to add highly qualified personnel to our commercial organization, with a strategic mix of sales personnel and clinical specialists, to drive further awareness and penetration with cataract surgeons.
 In addition to efforts focused on the high-volume cataract surgeons, we also aim to drive broad adoption with cataract surgeons and to make the RxSight system the standard of care for premium cataract surgery. To achieve this, our commercial organization is focused on driving awareness of the RxSight system through marketing efforts which include promotions at industry and society conferences, podium presentations, publications, social media, and educational webinars focused on highlighting the differentiated benefits of our system. While we believe that most doctors who are experienced with premium IOLs require minimal training to utilize our system, we have also developed a robust education capability for doctors, including tools, training programs and peer-to-peer support to facilitate adoption across doctors with all levels of experience. Because cataract surgery using LALs is largely equivalent to the same surgery used for other IOL products, surgeons only require a one-time training on implantation of our LAL. The surgeon, optometrist and technicians are trained on the use of the LDD. Our clinical training specialist attends the first day the staff conducts the LDD treatments to answer questions and direct the process. The clinical training function is an essential component to properly onboard new customers in the United States and to help existing customers utilize the technology to its full potential. For this reason, all customer operations team functions are fully integrated with our sales team and collaborate on new customer onboarding as well as supporting customers with training of their new personnel, upgrades and new indications for use and on-call questions.
 We believe providing ongoing support post-installation is critical to our success in commercializing the RxSight system. We maintain a team of field service engineers, distributed amongst our three core regions, who are responsible for the LDD installation, preventive maintenance and repairs when needed. This team is also responsible for conducting site surveys and ensuring a smooth installation process, typically over a four to five-hour window. The LDD’s reliability has an MTBF (Mean-time-between-failure) of over 215 days, providing a stable uptime. In addition to our field service team, we have an internal customer experience department that directly supports the customer, clinical training specialists and the field service team. We measure our customers’ onboarding satisfaction with an automated customer survey to all participants in the on-boarding training, after the surgeon has completed their first LAL surgery. The survey asks the customer to rate their satisfaction with the overall support and guidance provided by us during the product integration period. Our cumulative surveys, with 268 respondents, compiled as of Q4 2021 indicated 82.5% “Strongly Agree,” and 16.0% “Agree” and 1.5% “not sure” that they were satisfied with the overall support and guidance provided by us during the product integration period. We also elicit, in an open-ended question, suggestions for improvement, with no comments noting a material dissatisfaction with the RxSight system or training. In addition, we conduct a customer satisfaction survey of all customers approximately every 12 months.
Research and development
Our research and development activities are focused on improving clinical outcomes, improving customer experience, expanding our indications for use, reducing manufacturing costs and lifecycle management. Since our initial FDA approval in November 2017, we have received fifteen supplemental approvals including:
•increasing range of available LAL powers (4.0 — 30.0 diopters from a previous range of 10.0 — 30.0 diopters); 
 •corrections of 0.50 diopters of residual refractive error (initial capability was for correction down to 0.75 diopters of residual refractive error); 
 •new LAL injector and cartridge for customer ease of use and smaller cataract incision size (less likely to induce corneal astigmatism); 


•new UV spectacles with improved aesthetics and usability; 
 •addition of a photosensitive anterior layer that protects the lens from unwanted UV exposure (ActivShield); and 
 •Various manufacturing improvements for the LAL and LDD. 
 Ongoing future development activities are expected to include:
•reduced dependence on UV protective glasses and patient visits; 
 •cost reductions to the LDD; and manufacturing and supply;
 •continued LAL injector and cartridge improvement for surgeon and technician ease of use. 
 Research and development expenses were $24.5 million and $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 Manufacturing and supply
We currently manufacture, assemble, test, and ship our LAL and LDD, and various accessory products including a custom injector system for use with our LAL at our campus of four facilities and approximately 121,000 square feet total in Aliso Viejo, California. We have intentionally pursued a vertically integrated manufacturing strategy offering critical advantages, including control over our product quality and rapid product iteration using strong R&D and quality groups. We believe our current manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our current expected demand for at least the next 12 months.
We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and are licensed by the State of California to manufacture and distribute our medical devices. We are required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR (21 CFR 820). The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections and may also inspect the facilities of our suppliers. We moved to our current Aliso Viejo, California facilities starting in April 2016, all of which have been registered with the FDA, the State of California, and the European Notified Body (British Standards Institution) for the manufacture and distribution of medical devices. The FDA conducted its most recent inspection of our facilities in December 2021.
We have received International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 13485:2016 certification for our quality management system. ISO certification generally includes recertification audits every third year, scheduled annual surveillance audits and periodic unannounced audits. The most recent recertification and surveillance audit was conducted in December 2021. The last unannounced audit on our facilities was performed in May 2018. We have also received quality system certification to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) to cover the jurisdictions of United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and Australia from the British Standards Institution. The MDSAP certification follows the ISO 13485:2016 certification schedule.
 The LAL is a silicone intraocular lens made from a proprietary blend of custom chemical components. Chemical component vendors produce the raw materials, which we inspect, blend, further purify, and process, and formulate into uncured silicone blend. Using this uncured silicone, we mold the lens in one of our two Class 7 clean rooms. After curing, the molded lens is inspected and packaged and then sent to a third-party ethylene oxide sterilization vendor. After sterilization, the lens is returned to us for final inspection, packaging, and shipment to customers.
Our LDD is a UV projector medical device, which consists of an anterior segment biomicroscope, computer controllers for performing light treatments, and a biometrically designed patient interface and table. The optics are bonded into their mounts using epoxies, which are then oven cured, assembled into the main optical housing and optimized on a proprietary precision alignment station. The completed optical head is integrated into the table, along with a computer, power supplies and other electro-mechanical parts. We outsource the cables and circuit boards used in the LDD to certified specialty contract manufacturers. The fully assembled LDD is put through an electrical safety and final acceptance test process, and then reviewed by quality control, packaged and shipped directly to our customers for installation.

 In addition, to aid the doctor in implanting the LAL, we provide several accessories including a custom insertion system and a contact lens. The insertion system consists of a disposable cartridge and a reusable injector handpiece. The disposable cartridge is processed, inspected, and packaged by us while having ethylene oxide sterilization performed by a third-party vendor. The reusable injector handpiece is manufactured by a third-party vendor and is inspected and packaged by us. We also manufacture, inspect, and package a reusable contact lens for administering UV light treatments. The end user is responsible for performing cleaning and sterilization of the injector handpiece and the contact lens following directions for use and hands on training provided by us. We also provide custom UV glasses that are manufactured by third party vendors, and then inspected and shipped by us from our facilities to our customers.
We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally sourced components to produce the LAL, LDD, custom insertion system, and other accessory products. Externally sourced components include off-the-shelf chemical, materials, microchips integrated into printed circuit boards and cables, sub-assemblies, and custom parts that are provided by qualified and approved suppliers. We also employ a third-party sterilization vendor. Some components are provided by single-source or sole source suppliers. While there are other suppliers that could make or provide any one of our single sourced components, we seek to manage single-source supplier risk by regularly assessing the quality and capacity of our suppliers, implementing supply and quality agreements where appropriate and actively managing lead times and inventory levels of sourced components. In addition, we are currently in the process of identifying and approving alternative suppliers to dual or multi-source certain of our LAL raw materials and LDD components. We generally seek to maintain sufficient supply levels to help mitigate any supply interruptions and enable us to find and qualify another source of supply. Order quantities and lead times for externally sourced components are based on our forecasts, which are derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the materials, sub-assemblies, and parts. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in manufacturing interruptions at single and sole source suppliers in the United States, European Union, the U.K. and China, which we have been able to mitigate, to date, with selected pre-payment for product, expedite fees, sourcing from alternative suppliers, placing orders for specific chip sets separate from third party suppliers to ensure supply and longer-term orders.
Our suppliers are evaluated, qualified, and approved as part of our supplier quality program, which includes verification and monitoring procedures to ensure that our suppliers comply with FDA and ISO standards, as well as our own specifications and requirements. We inspect and verify externally sourced components under strict processes supported by internal policies and procedures. We maintain a rigorous change control policy to assure that no product or process changes are implemented without our prior review and approval.
Third-party reimbursement and patient billing
Dual aspect payment model
In the United States, the CMS has determined that the additional refractive correction provided by astigmatism correcting and presbyopia correcting (premium) IOLs is not a covered benefit. As described in two CMS rulings (CMS 05-01 and CMS 1536-R), premium IOLs have both a covered and non-covered aspect, providing the framework for the “dual-aspect payment model”. In effect since 2005, this model means that CMS does not reimburse the physician or the facility for the additional costs associated with a premium IOL, while still covering the cost of the conventional IOL procedure. Instead, the patient selecting a premium IOL is responsible for the additional charges from the physician and from the facility that exceed the regular charges for insertion of a conventional IOL that are submitted to CMS by each of these providers. As of 2017, CMS has recognized the LAL as an astigmatism correcting (premium) IOL, making it eligible for the dual aspect payment model. Most commercial payers mirror the Medicare rulings, but this can vary by payer.
Procedure coding and payment
In the United States, we primarily sell our LAL products to ambulatory surgical centers (“ASC’s”) and occasionally to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and state and government payors, as well as patients directly for the services provided to each patient.
Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. For cataract surgery, the most common specific CPT codes are 66984

(Cataract surgery with IOL, on stage) and 66982 (Cataract surgery, complex). The facility fees associated with these codes include payment for a conventional IOL, up to $150. A specific HCPCS code is listed on the CMS claim by the facility to indicate use of premium IOL for tracking purposes only (V2787 or V2788 for astigmatism-correcting or presbyopia-correction function of IOL respectively). Similarly, the physician includes HCPCS code A9270 (non-covered item or service) on their claim to Medicare (or another third party) to indicate charges for extended care related to the correction of refractive error.
While an Advanced Beneficiary Notice (“ABN”) or Notice of Exclusion from Medicare Benefits (“NEMB”) is not required, most providers issue an ABN or NEMB to alert patients that CMS (or non-Medicare payers) do not cover the additional charges associated with a premium IOL and to get the patient’s agreement to pay these charges. Patients are then billed directly by the physician and the ASC for these charges. In some cases, the physician bills the patient exclusively and then reimburses the ASC for the additional cost of the Premium IOL.
Commercial payor and government program coverage
While the dual aspect payment model has been in use for over 15 years, the extent to which this model will be used by non-government third-party payors, such as commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations may vary. One third-party payor’s decision does not ensure that other payors will also follow this model. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide additional support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that the dual aspect model will be applied consistently.
Reimbursement outside of the United States
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems also vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. In many countries, analogous determinations to the dual aspect CMS ruling have been made, allowing for partial coverage of the cataract procedure by national health systems, with patients paying out of pocket for refractive services associated with the premium IOL. In other countries, such dual billing is not allowed, forcing patients to pay for the entire cost of the cataract surgery and IOL when a premium IOL is used. In such markets, it may be possible for doctors to charge separately for the cost of light treatments, which are not part of the cataract procedure. This method would require a different billing methodology by us than is currently used in the United States, where light treatments are included with the purchase of the LAL. There is no assurance that these methodologies will be allowed or that an adequate level of payment will be established, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Intellectual Property, License Agreements, and Other Material Agreements
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others and prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the products and technology that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our technology, inventions, improvements and products that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio covers various aspects of our LDD, LAL and related devices and methods.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, in the United States, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional or Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) filing date. In certain instances, a patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment, or PTA) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension, or PTE), or both. Additionally, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. However, the life of the patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or

future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our current and future products. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our owned or in-licensed patents or whether such claims, if issued, will cover our products, provide sufficient protection from competitors or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, held unenforceable, infringed or circumvented.
Our patent portfolio as of January 31, 2022, includes approximately 24 owned issued and non-expired United States patents, 10 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, four pending PCT applications, 19 issued and non-expired foreign patents, and 20 pending foreign patent applications. These owned patents, and the patents, if any, that issue from these patent applications are projected to expire between 2022 and 2041, in each case without taking into account any possible PTA or PTE and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees.
As of January 31, 2022, we also have exclusively in-licensed approximately five issued and non-expired United States patents and 10 issued and non-expired foreign patents, which patents are projected to expire between 2031 and 2036, in each case without taking into account any possible PTA or PTE and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. These in-licensed patents are owned by the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech, and licensed to us, along with certain related technology, pursuant to our license agreement with Caltech effective as of July 28, 2015, or the Caltech Agreement.
Our patent portfolio, including our owned and exclusively in-licensed issued patents and patent applications, is generally directed to:
•Our current LAL: Some of the patents directed to our current LAL include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 9,119,710, which is expected to expire in 2026, U.S. Pat. No. 10,470,874, which is expected to expire in 2026, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,874,505, which is expected to expire in 2033. 
 •Our future LAL as contemplated or in development: Some of the patents directed to our future LAL include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,433,951, which is expected to expire in 2037, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,966,819, which is expected to expire in 2037. 
 •Our LDD: Some of the patents directed to our LDD include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,864,075, which is expected to expire in 2038, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,932,864, which is expected to expire in 2039. 
 •Our lens adjustment procedure: Some of the patents directed to our lens adjustment procedure include, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,010,406, which is expected to expire in 2032, and U.S. Pat. No. 10,166,731, which is expected to expire in 2036. 
 •Our system accessories: A patent directed to our system accessories includes, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 10,456,240, which is expected to expire in 2038. 
 Pursuant to the Caltech agreement, we received an exclusive, royalty-bearing, nontransferable, worldwide license under such patent rights and technology to manufacture, use and commercialize, in all fields, products covered by the licensed patents or that utilize the licensed technology. The licenses granted to us by Caltech are subject to certain retained rights of Caltech for educational and research purposes and certain retained rights of the U.S. government. We are subject to certain diligence obligations under the Caltech Agreement with respect to the commercialization of the licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreement with Caltech, we paid a $50,000 non-refundable license issue fee upon the execution of the agreement and agreed to reimburse Caltech approximately $64,680 for past patent prosecution and maintenance expenses. Further, we have an obligation to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $10,000. We are also obligated to pay (i) a low-single-digit royalty based on net sales of products covered by the licensed patents, which royalty obligation expires, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, upon the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country and (ii) a fraction of a single-digit royalty based on net sales of products covered only by the licensed technology, which royalty obligation expires, on a country-by-country-basis, seven years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Following the first commercial sale of a licensed product, we are required to pay a minimum annual royalty to Caltech of $50,000 on each anniversary of the effective date of the Caltech Agreement. We are also obligated to pay Caltech a mid-teen royalty on any applicable sublicensing revenue. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Caltech Agreement continues until the later of the expiration, revocation, invalidation or

unenforceability of the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations under the agreement. Caltech may terminate the Caltech Agreement for our insolvency, failure to maintain required insurance coverage levels, or if we materially breach the agreement, including our payment or diligence obligations thereunder, and do not cure such breach within specified time periods. Currently, we do not sell any licensed products under the agreement, and therefore we have no current royalty obligation to Caltech. We are considering the development of future products to which the intellectual property in-licensed from Caltech may be directed, however we do not believe these are material at this time.
Pursuant to the agreement with the Regents of the University of California (“Regents”) dated March 1, 2000 (the “Regents Agreement”), we received an exclusive, royalty bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain Regents’ patent rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import products and to practice methods in the research, development, and commercialization of products for commercial applications. This license was subject to certain retained rights of the Regents and Caltech for educational and research purposes and certain retained rights of the U.S. government. We were subject to certain diligence obligations under the Regents Agreement with respect to the commercialization of the licensed products. Pursuant to our license agreement with the Regents, we paid a $10,000 non-refundable license issue fee upon the execution of the Regents Agreement and agreed to reimburse the Regents approximately $57,000 for past patent prosecution and maintenance expenses. Further, we had an obligation to pay, and paid, an annual license maintenance fee of $5,000. We were also obligated to pay a low-single digit royalty based on net sales of products covered by the licensed patents, which royalty obligation expires, upon the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product. Following the first commercial sale of a licensed product, we were required to pay, and paid, a minimum annual royalty to the Regents of $10,000 by February 28th for the calendar year in which the minimum payment is due. Upon a filing of an Investigational Device Exemption by us with the FDA for a trial involving more than 20 persons, or other equivalent applications, we paid $20,000 to the Regents. Following the first use of a licensed product in a patient as part of a Phase II or Phase III clinical trial, we paid $30,000 and $50,000, respectively to the Regents. Upon an approval by the FDA of a Pre-Marketing Approval Application or equivalent application submitted by us, we paid $175,000 to the Regents. We were also obligated to pay the Regents a percentage of all compensation received by us from sublicensees other than royalties on sales of the licensed products, not to exceed $500,000, for which there were no payments as we did not sublicense the licensed patents. In aggregate, since inception, we have paid approximately $525,000 in patent prosecution and maintenance fees, license fees, minimum royalties and milestone fees pursuant to the Regents Agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Regents Agreement continued until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent included in Regents’ patent rights licensed under the Regents Agreement. The Regents had the right to terminate the agreement if we materially breached the agreement, including our payment or diligence obligations thereunder, and did not cure such breach within specified time periods. We had the right to terminate the agreement at will in whole or as to any portion of the Regents’ patent rights by giving notice in writing to Regents. We terminated the Regents Agreement in March of 2021, as the last licensed patent covering our product expired. In connection with the closing of our initial public offering we paid the Regents $25,000, which survived the termination of the Regents Agreement.
Pursuant to the agreement with QAD, Inc. (“QAD”) dated October 29, 2015 (the “QAD Agreement”), we received a nonexclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to use certain QAD software at the physical location where we install the software. Under the agreement, we purchase such QAD software through individual orders (“Purchase Orders”), and each Purchase Order has a respective payment fee and maintenance fee. We use the software licensed under the QAD agreement for inventory, shipping / receiving, sales order, work order, planning and financial transactions for the business. Maintenance for the software is offered by QAD and available for purchase by us on an annual basis, and such purchase was compulsory for the first year of the agreement. After the first year, maintenance purchased under the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by us or QAD 60 days prior to the effective date of any renewal term. Further, we grant QAD audit rights to verify our usage of QAD software, and if following such audit our use of the QAD software is in excess of our license, we are obligated to pay to QAD the amounts necessary to become compliant. QAD provides limited warranties to the software and retains all intellectual property ownership rights in the QAD software including any modifications made by us, however we receive a license to use any modifications made by us. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the QAD agreement is perpetual. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for convenience by giving the other party 90 days prior written notice and such termination does not affect the license granted. Either party to the agreement may terminate the agreement with notice, if the other materially breaches the agreement, and the breach is not cured within specified time periods. In addition, either party may terminate if the

other party is adjudicated bankrupt or an official is appointed to manage its financial affairs. Upon termination for cause, we must immediately discontinue all use of the software.
We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and current and future products. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future products. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and know-how, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, service providers, and contractors but these agreements may not provide meaningful protection, and we cannot guarantee that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we take steps to protect our trade secrets and know-how, third parties may independently develop or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
For more information, please see “Risk Factors-Risks related to Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Competition
Competition in the surgical ophthalmology market is intense and is primarily driven by technological innovation and the regulatory approval required to commercialize products in the key markets around the world. The development of new or improved products may make existing products less attractive, reduce them to commodity status or even make them obsolete. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•the quality of patient outcomes, oftentimes measured by visual acuity, and adverse event rates; 
 •patient experience, including patient recovery time and level of discomfort; 
 •acceptance by treating doctors and referral sources; 
 •doctor learning curves and willingness to adopt new technologies; 
 •ease-of-use and reliability; 
 •economic benefits and cost savings; 
 •strength of clinical evidence; 
 •effective distribution and marketing to surgeons and potential patients; and 
 •product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 
 From a commercial perspective, we believe our primary competitors in the cataract IOL market are alternative premium IOL providers, including Alcon, Johnson & Johnson, Bausch + Lomb, BVI, Hoya, and Carl Zeiss Meditec. According to Market Scope, the global cataract IOL market is highly concentrated, with these top five players accounting for approximately 74% of total market revenue. Our competitors are significantly larger than us with greater financial, marketing, sales and personnel resources, greater brand recognition and longer operating histories. We believe our ability to compete effectively will be dependent on our ability to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to effectively and cost-efficiently drive awareness of the unique value of our system.
In addition, patients who receive an LAL will be required to wear UV protective spectacles until final lock-in which is approximately 4-5 weeks after surgery. They will also be required to return for an additional 2-3 clinic visits compared to traditional cataract surgery. The additional clinic visits are non-surgical but do require the patient’s eyes to be dilated. Due to these additional requirements, market acceptance of the LAL may be impacted.
The two most popular premium IOLs approved for cataract treatment are PanOptix by Alcon and Tecnis by Johnson & Johnson. According to the Market Scope 2021 Premium Report Alcon, Johnson & Johnson and Carl Zeiss Meditec are the three largest IOL manufacturers, with an estimated 2021 revenue share of the premium IOL market of 51.3%, 23.2%, and 8.1% respectively. The PanOptix and Tecnis families of IOLs are available in a monofocal Toric, multifocal Toric and EDOF Toric versions. The Toric versions of these lenses represent

approximately 54% of all premium multifocal IOLs sold in 2021. The rest of the market is shared between several smaller companies each with under 5% market share. From a technology perspective, we believe the LAL competes with nearly all of the existing IOLs, including conventional, premium astigmatism correcting and premium presbyopia correcting lenses.
 Government regulation
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal, state and local regulatory authorities in the United States, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use.
FDA regulation of medical devices
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of FDA’s current good manufacturing practices for devices, as reflected in of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, establishment registration and device listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, product-specific FDA guidance documents, special labeling requirements and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. Due to the level of risk associated with Class III devices, the FDA’s general controls and special controls alone are insufficient to assure their safety and effectiveness. Devices placed in Class III generally require the submission of a PMA application, demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device which must be approved by the FDA prior to marketing, or the receipt of a 510(k) de novo classification, which provides for the reclassification of the device into Class I or II. The PMA approval process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III.

The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
Investigational device process
In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed, and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA.
The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and effectiveness success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
•The FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 
 •Patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 
 •Patients do not comply with trial protocols;
 •Patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 
 •Patients experience adverse events; 
 •Patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial; 
 •Device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences; 


•Side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA’s view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing; 
 •Institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 
 •Third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations, or other FDA or IRB requirements; 
 •Third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA; 
 •We or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records, and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations; 
 •Third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or we or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 
 •Regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
 •Changes in government regulations or administrative actions; 
 •The interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or effectiveness; or 
 •The FDA concludes that our trial design is unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 The 510(k) clearance process
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device.
A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is considered to be substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use, and has either (i) the same technological characteristics; or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes, but not always, required to support substantial equivalence.
Before the FDA will accept a 510(k) premarket notification for substantive review, the FDA will first assess whether the submission satisfies a minimum threshold of acceptability. If the FDA determines that the 510(k) submission lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will issue a “Refuse to Accept” letter which generally outlines the information the FDA believes is necessary to permit a substantive review and to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence. An applicant must submit the requested information before the FDA will proceed with additional review of the submission. If a 510(k) submission is accepted for substantive review, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments sets a performance goal of 90 days for FDA review of a 510(k) submission, but the review time can be delayed if FDA raises questions or requests additional information during the review process. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Thus, as a practical matter, clearance often takes longer than 90 days. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.

If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
Medical devices can only be marketed for the indications for which they are cleared or approved. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application or de novo classification. The determination as to whether or not a modification constitutes such a change is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The PMA approval process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the substantive review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g., major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
•The device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
 •The data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval; 
 •The manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 
 •Changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 
 If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.

New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also require post-market surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. Significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design for a device which has received approval through the PMA process may require submission of a new PMA application or PMA supplement prior to marketing.
Ongoing regulation by the FDA
Even after the FDA permits a device to be marketed, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including but not limited to:
•establishment registration and device listing; 
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements, restrictions on sale distribution or use of a device, each including the FDA general prohibition against the promotion of products for any uses other than those authorized by the FDA, which are commonly known as “off label” uses;
 •the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR regulation, which requires that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •medical device corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; 
 •recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
 •an order of repair, replacement or refund; 
 •device tracking requirements; and 
 •post market study and surveillance requirements. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k)

clearance or a PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, some states also require medical device manufacturers and/or distributors doing business within the state to register with the state or apply for a state license, which could subject our facility to state inspection as well as FDA inspection on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR and any applicable state requirements. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •delay in processing, clearing or approving submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products; 
 •FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 
 •suspension or withdrawal of FDA approvals or clearances that have already been granted; and 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.
When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or Form FDA 483. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA following an inspection, we would be required to respond in writing, and would be required to undertake corrective and/or preventive or other actions in order to address the FDA’s or other regulators’ concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
International medical device premarket authorization process
The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Our products are regulated in the European

Union as medical devices per European Union Directive 93/42/EEC, also known as the Medical Device Directive, or MDD. The MDD sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certified device is marked with the CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformité. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for the CE mark vary according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the conformity assessment required before the CE mark can be placed on a product. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of a one-member state has issued a Certificat de Conformité, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations and the quality system requirements of the ISO 13485 standard.
The new European Union Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745, or EU MDR, which was published in May 2017 with a transition period of three years, replaces the MDD and will expand and modify the pre-market and post-market obligations of the MDD. The date of application of the EU MDR has been postponed to May 26, 2021 with implementation dates based off of risk classification of the medical device. The EU MDR will impose additional requirements on clinical evaluation process, safety, classification and performance of medical device products. The EU MDR will have no impact on our current and future products as registrations to the EU MDR are in process and are scheduled for completion prior to the implementation dates. The company has passed the MDR upgrade assessment with no observations and a recommendation for certification by the European Notified Body in December 2021. In addition to inspections by the FDA and other regulatory entities, we are also subject to periodic inspections by applicable European Notified Body with respect to regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured by us and clinical trials sponsored by us. We are also certified to the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) for the jurisdictions of the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, and Australia which allows for one single audit performed by Notified Body to cover those jurisdictions with respect to quality systems. All registrations and certifications due to Great Britain leaving the European Union (Brexit) and Switzerland ending a joint agreement with the European Union (Swexit) have been done to the timelines as required for these countries and will continue to be performed to the updated timelines as published during these processes.
 Other U.S. regulatory matters
Medical device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product clearance or approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse, anti-kickback false claims, transparency, government price reporting, anti-corruption, and health information privacy and security laws and regulations. Internationally, other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services. These laws include the following:
•U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular medical device, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Almost any financial arrangement with a healthcare provider, patient or customer could implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain arrangements if specific requirements are met. The government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against arrangements that do not fit within a safe harbor. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the 


government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for violations of the Anti- Kickback Statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Our exclusion would mean that procedures using our products would no longer be eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare programs;
•Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal Civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare companies by private individuals has increased dramatically. The federal civil and criminal false claims acts, including the civil FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. No specific intent to defraud is required under the civil FCA. The criminal FCA provides for criminal penalties for submitting false claims, including imprisonment and criminal fines; 
 •The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 and implementing regulations impose penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; 
 •HIPAA prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; 
 •The FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of medical devices; 
 •Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to doctors. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
 •The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations; 


•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-referral, and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require certain biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require applicable manufacturers to disclose or report certain information related to payments and other transfers of value to doctors and entities or sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, marketing expenditures and activities, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and state laws related to insurance fraud in the case of claims involving private insurers. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, such as stock-option compensation paid to doctors that have entered into consulting agreements with us, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The growth of our business and sales organization and our expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to various interpretations. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.
United States health care reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage for the procedures associated with the use of our products or result in lower reimbursement for those procedures. The cost containment measures that payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Changes in healthcare policy, including changes in the implementation or the repeal of the ACA in the United States, could increase our costs, decrease our revenue and impact sales of and reimbursement and coverage for our current and future products. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In particular, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case and held oral arguments in November 2020. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, and healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2031 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation, the

actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Moreover, there recently has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Data privacy and security
Medical device companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, (“HHS”), affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, or PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
Even when HIPAA does not apply, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Personally identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, created new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provided new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach.

Additionally, in November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”). The CPRA, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2023 and create additional obligations with respect to certain data relating to consumers, significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers, such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new entity, the California Privacy Protection Agency, to implement and enforce the law. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. In addition to the CCPA, numerous other states’ legislatures have passed or are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment.
The EU also has laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use and processing of personal data obtained from individuals in the EU, namely the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. These regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States and may restrict transfers of personal data to the United States unless certain requirements are met. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs to increase, and harm our business and financial condition. Further, the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2021, we are also subject to the UK General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Act of 2018, which retains the GDPR in the United Kingdom’s national law. Failure to comply with any of these obligations could expose us to significant fines.
Employees and human capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 221 full-time employees, including 87 employees in sales & marketing, 22 in general and administrative functions, 57 in research and development and 55 in manufacturing. All of our employees are full-time and none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is in Aliso Viejo, California where we lease four facilities housing our headquarters, manufacturing, research and development and administrative offices. The facility leases are for approximately 121,000 square feet in the aggregate. The leases terminate on (a) September 30, 2024, with one option to extend for five years; (b) January 31, 2026, with three options to extend for five years each; (c) March 31, 2023 with two options to extend for five years each; and (d) August 31, 2024, with one option to extend for five years. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our near-term needs but expect to need additional space as we grow. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space would be available in the future as required on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
Corporate information
