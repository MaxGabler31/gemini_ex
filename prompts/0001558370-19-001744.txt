Market Area 
    
HarborOne Bank. HarborOne Bank provides financial services to individuals, families, small and mid-size businesses and municipalities throughout Southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. While our primary deposit-gathering area is concentrated within our branch office communities and surrounding cities and towns, our lending area encompasses the broader market of New England. 
    
Due to our proximity to Boston and Providence, our primary market area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning, medical care and research centers and the corporate headquarters of several investment and financial services companies. The greater Boston metropolitan area also has many life science and high technology companies employing personnel with specialized skills, which impacts the demand for residential homes, residential construction, office buildings, shopping centers, and other commercial properties in our market area. Communities within our market area include many older residential commuter towns, which function partially as business and service centers. 
    
Massachusetts’ population is projected to grow 3.1%, and Massachusetts household income is projected to grow 11.6%, from 2019 to 2024. Rhode Island’s population is projected to grow 0.73%, and Rhode Island household income is projected to grow 7.5%, over the same timeframe.
     HarborOne Mortgage. HarborOne Mortgage maintains 34 offices in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and New Jersey, and is licensed to lend in five additional states.

 Competition

HarborOne Bank.  HarborOne Bank faces significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from banking institutions operating in our primary market area and from other financial service companies such as securities brokerage firms, credit unions, and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds and mutual funds. Many of the banks that operate in our primary market area are owned by large national and regional holding companies, are larger than we are and therefore may have greater resources or offer a broader range of products and services. 
     Our competition for loans comes from financial institutions, including credit unions, in our primary market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies, mortgage brokers and the finance arms of auto makers. Competition for loans also comes from non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies. 

    We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks and other financial services companies to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet, and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Increased competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future
    
HarborOne Mortgage. HarborOne Mortgage faces competition for originating loans both directly within the markets in which it operates and from entities that provide services throughout the United States through internet channels. HarborOne Mortgage’s competition comes principally from other mortgage banking firms, as well as from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions.
         Lending Activities
     The scope of the discussion included under “Lending Activities” is limited to lending operations related to loans originated for investment. A discussion of the lending activities related to loans originated for sale is included under “Mortgage Banking Activity.”
     Commercial Real Estate Loans.   Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, retail development, manufacturing facilities, warehouse distribution, hospitality and apartment buildings. We currently focus our commercial real estate efforts on small- and mid-size owner occupants and investors in our market area seeking loans between $350,000 and $25.0 million. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans were $934.4 million, or 31.4% of total loans, and consisted of $343.0 million of fixed-rate loans and $591.4 million of adjustable-rate loans. 
     We originate fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans typically with terms of five to ten years, though loans may be for terms of up to 20 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans typically adjust in accordance with a designated index every three, five or seven years. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years to a specified percentage above the corresponding FHLB Classic Advance borrowing rate and amortize over a 25-year term. We also offer interest rate swaps to accommodate customer needs. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80.0% of the property's appraised value at the time the loan is originated. 
     We consider a number of factors when underwriting commercial real estate loans that include projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement, the age and condition of the collateral, the profitability and the value of the underlying property, the financial resources and income level of the sponsor and their experience in owning or managing similar properties, and the borrower’s credit history. When circumstances warrant, personal guarantees are obtained from the principals of the borrower on commercial real estate. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, where applicable, to provide annual financial statements on commercial real estate loans. We also generally require an independent appraisal or valuation, an environmental survey and a property condition report for commercial real estate loans.
     In addition to originating these loans, we participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions located primarily in Massachusetts and sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent to manage our credit risk. See below “Loan Underwriting Risks – Loan Participations.”

 At December 31, 2018, the average originated loan balance of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $3.5 million, and our four largest credits ranged from $14.0 million to $16.0 million. These loans were performing in accordance with their original terms at December 31, 2018. Our largest commercial real estate relationship totaled $34.1 million and consists of loans to finance hotels.
     Commercial Loans.  We originate commercial loans and lines of credit to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships and small- to medium-sized businesses, primarily in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with sales typically up to $75.0 million and borrowing needs up to $10.0 million, for working capital and other business purposes. In connection with the Coastway acquisition we acquired a small business lending team that will generate small business loans, including loans originated through the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), which provide a partial government guarantee. Small business loans, including real estate loans, generally consist of loans to businesses with commercial credit needs of less than or equal to $250,000 and revenues of less than $2.5 million.
     At December 31, 2018, commercial loans were $277.3 million, or 9.3% of total loans, and included $139.2 million in small business loans of which $47.9 million had a partial SBA guarantee. At December 31, 2018, commercial loans consisted of $74.5 million of fixed-rate loans and $202.8 million of adjustable-rate loans.
     Commercial loans are originated with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates are based on a margin over the LIBOR index or tied to the Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Fixed-rate business loans are generally indexed to a corresponding FHLB rate, plus a margin. Commercial loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest spreads than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We generally require that our commercial customers maintain a deposit relationship with the Bank. 
     When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements and the experience of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Commercial loan amounts are determined based on the capacity for debt service and an evaluation of the age, condition and collectability of the collateral but generally, advance rates for certain asset classes would not exceed 80.0%.  
     At December 31, 2018, the average originated balance of our outstanding commercial loans was $300,000 and our four largest commercial loan exposures ranged from $5.5 million to $11.1 million. These loans are secured by business assets of the borrower and were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2018. 
     Commercial Construction Loans.    We originate commercial construction loans for commercial development projects, including industrial buildings, retail and office buildings and speculative residential real estate. At December 31, 2018, construction loan balances were $161.7 million, or 5.4% of total loans. At December 31, 2018, our commercial construction loan portfolio consisted of $7.4 million in loan balances that were secured by speculative residential real estate loan projects, $135.6 million in loans that were secured by commercial real estate speculative projects and $18.7 million secured by owner occupied commercial real estate projects. At December 31, 2018, unadvanced funds on commercial construction loans was $103.0 million.
     Our commercial construction loans generally call for the payment of interest only with interest rates tied to LIBOR or Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Construction loans for commercial real estate projects can be originated with principal balances of up to $20.0 million, but generally are lower; the average originated principal balance at December 31, 2018 was $5.1 million.  Advances on commercial construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction and repayment is generally expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction.
     At December 31, 2018, our largest outstanding commercial construction loan was $14.5 million, and the average balance of our outstanding commercial construction loans was $2.7 million. This project is secured by a first mortgage to develop an apartment building and was performing according to its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018.
     One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans.    We provide residential real estate loans through HarborOne Mortgage for home purchase or refinancing of existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2018, residential mortgage loans were $942.7 million, or 31.6% of total loans, and consisted of $846.7 million and $96.0 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively. We offer fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years.
     Our one- to four-family residential mortgage originations are generally underwritten to conform to Federal National Mortgage Association, or "Fannie Mae," and Federal National Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or "Freddie Mac," underwriting guidelines. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually or after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to seven years and are 

 
  6

 
adjusted to a rate equal to a specified percentage above the LIBOR or U.S. Treasury index. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2.0% per adjustment period with the lifetime interest rate caps ranging from 5.0% to 6.0% over the initial interest rate of the loan. 
     Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 
     While residential mortgage loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. 
     We originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 80.0% and we generally require private mortgage insurance for residential loans secured by a first mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio over 80.0%. We generally require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Exceptions to these lending policies are based on an evaluation of credit risk related to the borrower and the size of the loan. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone. 
     In an effort to provide financing for first-time buyers, we offer adjustable- and fixed-rate loans to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines, reduced interest rates and loan conditions and reduced closing costs. We also participate in publicly sponsored loan programs which provide competitive terms for low and moderate income home buyers.
     The majority of the conforming fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we originate are sold to the secondary market, mainly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with servicing retained other than for specialized governmental programs that require servicing to be released.  Generally, we hold in our portfolio nonconforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. 
     We generally do not (i) originate "interest only" mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential properties, (ii) offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal such as "option ARM" loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan, (iii) offer "subprime" loans (loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity) or (iv) offer "Alt-A" loans (loans to borrowers having less than full documentation). 
     Second Mortgages and Equity Lines of Credit.    We offer second mortgages and equity lines of credit, which are secured by owner-occupied residences. At December 31, 2018, second mortgages and equity lines of credit were $158.1 million, or 5.3% of total loans. Second mortgages are made at fixed interest rates and terms of up to fifteen years. Equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest that are indexed to the Prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal plus or minus a margin, and generally are subject to an interest rate floor, with 10-year draws and repayment terms of between five and 20 years. We offer second mortgages and equity lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80.0%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loan and first mortgage loan. We hold a first mortgage position on the homes that secure second mortgages or equity lines of credit in approximately one-third of the portfolio. 
     The procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant's creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. The procedures for underwriting residential mortgage loans apply equally to second mortgages and equity lines of credit. 
     Residential Construction Loans.  We originate residential real estate construction loans through HarborOne Mortgage to professional developers, contractors and builders, and to a lesser extent, individuals, to finance the construction of residential dwellings. At December 31, 2018, the balance of residential construction loans was $14.7 million and unadvanced funds were $8.3 million.
     Our residential real estate construction loans generally are fixed-rate loans that provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 to 36 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may be paid in full or converted 

 
  7

 
to a permanent mortgage loan. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we generally require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Our loan policy dictates a minimum equity contribution by the borrower of 20.0% and a loan-to-value ratio not greater than 80.0% of the appraised market value estimated upon completion of the project. All borrowers are underwritten and evaluated for creditworthiness based on past experience, debt service ability, net worth analysis including available liquidity, and other credit factors. Advances are only made following an inspection of the property confirming completion of the required progress on the project and an update to the title completed by a bank approved attorney.
     Auto and Other Consumer Loans.   While we stopped originating indirect auto loans in 2018, we continue to fund indirect auto lease loans for the leasing of new or used automobiles through our relationship with Credit Union Leasing of America, or “CULA”. At December 31, 2018, auto loans were $478.9 million, or 16.1% of total loans and 97.4% of consumer loans. Other consumer loans, consisting primarily of unsecured lines of credit and personal loans, were $12.6 million, or 0.4% of total loans. Auto loans consisted of $384.2 million of auto lease loans, $85.8 million of indirect auto loans and $8.9 million in direct auto loans.
    
An indirect auto lease is originated when a customer, the lessee, agrees to lease a vehicle where the lessee is guaranteed use of the vehicle over a specified term. The lease payment consists of the monthly depreciation of the vehicle, interest, and if applicable, depending on the state, sales tax. At the end of the lease term, the lessee has the option of returning the vehicle, purchasing it outright for the agreed upon contractual residual value or purchasing the vehicle and financing it by means of a conventional fully amortizing auto loan. The Bank is assigned leases through an agreement with CULA. At the origination of the lease, the car dealership sells the lease and related vehicle to CULA. CULA simultaneously assigns the lease and grants a security interest in the vehicle to the Bank. 
    
Indirect auto lease loans generally have a higher rate of return than indirect auto loans because interest rates on leases are higher, the lease loans tend to last for the full term of the lease, and lessees typically have higher credit scores. Lease terms vary between 12 and 60 months, but typically average 36 to 39 months in duration. 
     The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
     Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales.    Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are our loan originators, and to a lesser extent, local mortgage brokers and third party originators of residential loans, advertising and referrals from customers. We occasionally purchase participation interests in commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. In addition, we sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily the portion of loans that exceed our borrowing limits or are in an amount that is considered prudent to manage our credit risk.
    
Our current practice is generally (1) to sell to the secondary market newly originated 15-year or longer term conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and (2) to hold in our portfolio nonconforming loans, shorter-term fixed-rate loans, jumbo loans and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. Our decision to sell loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management. Loans are sold to third parties with servicing either retained or released. 
     For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we originated loans of $1.51 billion and $1.73 billion of loans, respectively. During the same periods, we sold $977.4 million and $1.16 billion of loans, respectively. 
     Mortgage Banking Activity.    We originate residential mortgage loans through HarborOne Mortgage. For the year ended December 31, 2018, HarborOne Mortgage originated $866.9 million in mortgage loans. HarborOne Mortgage sells loans on both a servicing-released and a servicing-retained basis. HarborOne Mortgage has contracted with a third party to service the loans for which it retains servicing. HarborOne Bank purchases residential mortgage loans for portfolio from HarborOne Mortgage. These purchases generally consist of short term fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages and nonconforming mortgages. The Bank’s decision to purchase loans from HarborOne Mortgage is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions, interest rate risk management and balance sheet management.
     Our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type (conventional loans versus governmental) and loan purpose (purchase versus refinance). Conventional loans include loans that conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards, whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed or insured by the federal government, such as a Federal Housing Authority or a Veterans’ Administration loan.

 Loan Underwriting Risks 
     Commercial Real Estate Loans.    Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower's creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. In addition, our commercial borrowers may have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than residential real estate loans. If we are forced to foreclose on a commercial real estate property due to default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.
     Commercial Loans.    Commercial loans also involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower's business, although small business loans originated through the SBA program include a partial guarantee.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 
     Construction Loans.    Construction financing is considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of the foregoing, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If we are forced to foreclose on a project before or at completion due to a default, we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. 
     Residential Real Estate Loans.    Due to historically low interest rate levels, borrowers generally have preferred fixed-rate loans in recent years. While we anticipate that our adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects on our net interest income of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, the increased mortgage payments required of adjustable-rate loans in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. If we are forced to foreclose on a residential property due to default, the marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment, and we may not be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.  In addition, although adjustable-rate loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.         Consumer Loans.    Consumer loans entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In such cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.  
     Loan Participations.    We cultivate relationships with other financial institutions to mitigate the risk of our lending activities by participating either as the lead bank or as a participant in various loan transactions. We purchase participation interests in larger balance loans from other financial institutions generally in our market area. Such participations are evaluated with the same level of due diligence and care as loans we originate. The participations are underwritten, reviewed for compliance, and approved in accordance with our underwriting policies and criteria. We actively monitor the performance of such loans and periodically receive updated financial statements of the borrower from the lead lender in accordance with loan reporting requirements and covenant testing. These loans are subjected to regular internal reviews in accordance with our loan policy.

 We also participate in a commercial lending network operated by BancAlliance. As of December 31, 2018, total exposure for this program was $18.1 million comprising 15 credits. All but one of these relationships were performing in accordance with their payment terms. The BancAlliance substandard loan is a $1.3 million loan that is on nonaccrual and under a forbearance agreement. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balances of commercial loan participations purchased outside of the BancAlliance network totaled $9.2 million. We also participate in commercial real estate loans that totaled $142.2 million and commercial construction loans that totaled $53.7 million at December 31, 2018.  
     We sell loan participations in the ordinary course of business when a loan originated by us exceeds our legal lending limit or we otherwise deem it prudent to share the risk with another lending institution. We were the lead bank in commercial real estate loans of $277.4 million, commercial construction loans of $46.5 million and commercial loans of $7.3 million with participation balances sold that totaled $111.1 million, $28.8 million and $1.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. As compared to December 31, 2017, this represents an increase of $40.7 million in commercial real estate participations sold, a $14.0 million increase in commercial construction participations sold, and an increase of $1.0 million in commercial participations sold.
     Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.    Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. Our board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain executive officers. Commercial loans in excess of any officer's individual authority must be approved by a lending committee comprised of several executive officers. Commercial loans in excess of the lending committee authority must be approved by the board of directors or by the executive committee, which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer and three independent members of our Board of Directors. Commercial loans in excess of the "in-house limit" must be approved by the board of directors. The executive committee of the board of directors reviews all commercial loan requests greater than $1.0 million and commercial real estate loan requests greater than $3.0 million. All mortgage and commercial real estate loans to any single borrower that exceed $7.5 million and commercial loans that exceed $3.0 million must be approved by the board of directors. 
     Loans-to-One Borrower Limit.    The maximum amount that the Bank may lend to one borrower and the borrower's related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20.0% of the Bank's capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the Bank's capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. At December 31, 2018, the Bank's regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $63.4 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship totaled $34.1 million and was comprised of four loans to finance hotels. These loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. Our internal loans-to-one borrower limit is $38.5 million. 
     Investment Activities 
     General.    At December 31, 2018, securities totaled $254.0 million. The securities portfolio consists of U.S. government and government sponsored enterprise obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, state, county and municipal bonds and small business administration asset-backed securities. The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors reviews and approves our investment policy annually. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our president or our chief financial officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. We classify the majority of our securities as available-for-sale. 
     We have legal authority to invest in various types of securities, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions and investment grade corporate bonds. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLB stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in marketable equity securities and derivative securities, we had no investments in such securities at December 31, 2018. 

    Investment Securities.  At December 31, 2018 our securities portfolio consisted of the following:
    
U.S. Government and Government-Sponsored Enterprise Obligations. At December 31, 2018, we had U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprise securities totaling $28.0 million, which constituted 10.8% of our securities portfolio. While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities investment portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent we deem appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and for prepayment protection. 
    
U.S. Government and Government-Sponsored Mortgage-Backed and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, or “CMOs”. At December 31, 2018, we had mortgage-backed securities and CMOs totaling $151.7 million, which constituted 59.7 % of our securities 

 
  10

 
portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of residential mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one- to four-family or multi-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of our mortgage-backed securities are either backed by the Government National Mortgage Association, or “Ginnie Mae,” a U.S. government agency, or government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
    
Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. 
    
U.S. Small Business Administration Asset-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had investments in participation certificates issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration totaling $52.6 million. 
    
Tax Exempt Municipal Bonds. At December 31, 2018, we had $22.1 million invested in issues of a diversified municipal bond portfolio. All but one of these bonds are rated in the top four tiers in terms of credit ratings by Moody’s and S&P and the lowest rated bond is rated A1 by Moody’s and is in the amount of $633,000. 
    
In addition to our securities portfolio, we also have investments in FHLB stock and bank-owned life insurance. 
    
FHLB Stock. In connection with our borrowing activities, we held common stock of the FHLB totaling $25.0 million at December 31, 2018. The FHLB common stock is carried at cost and classified as a restricted equity security. We may be required to purchase additional FHLB stock if we increase borrowings in the future. 
    
Bank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for our benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-taxable. At December 31, 2018, our balance in bank-owned life insurance totaled $44.6 million and was issued by four highly rated insurance companies.
     Sources of Funds 
     General.    Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. 
     Deposit Accounts.    At December 31, 2018, total deposits were $2.69 billion. Deposits are attracted from within our market area by sales efforts of our retail branch network, municipal department and commercial loan officers, advertising and through our website. We offer a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and term certificates of deposit. We also offer a variety of deposit accounts designed for businesses and municipalities operating in our market area. Our business banking deposit products include a commercial checking account, sweep accounts, money market accounts and checking accounts specifically designed for small businesses. We also offer remote deposit capture products for business customers to meet their online banking needs. Additionally, the Bank has a municipal banking department that provides core depository services to local municipalities. At December 31, 2018, municipal deposits totaled $255.1 million and consisted of relationships with over 40 cities and towns. The Bank also participates in a reciprocal deposit program that provides access to FDIC insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding the current insurance limits for depositors. At December 31, 2018, total reciprocal deposits were $110.4 million and included $105.3 million of municipal deposits.
     The Bank utilizes a deposit listing service which targets institutional funds throughout the country. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. Also, when rates and terms are favorable, the Bank supplements the customer deposit base with brokered deposits. At December 31, 2018, we had $28.1 million of institutional deposits and $77.5 million of brokered deposits, which represented 3.7% of total deposits at December 31, 2018 with such funds having a weighted average remaining term to 

 
  11

 
maturity of 7.5 months. In a rising rate environment, we may be unwilling or unable to pay a competitive rate. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with us, they may need to be replaced with borrowings, which could increase our cost of funds and negatively impact our interest rate spread, financial condition and results of operations. 
     Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability to us, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
     Borrowings.    At December 31, 2018, total borrowings were $553.7 million. Borrowings consist of short-term and long-term obligations from the FHLB and subordinated debentures issued in 2018.  The Bank is a member of the FHLB Boston which provides access to wholesale funding to supplement our supply of investable funds. The FHLB functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and portions of our loan portfolio identified under a blanket lien, provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution's net worth or on the FHLB's assessment of the institution's creditworthiness. At December 31, 2018, based on available collateral and our ownership of FHLB stock, we had access to additional FHLB advances of up to $404.3 million. All of our borrowings from the FHLB are secured by a blanket lien on residential real estate and certain other loans. 
     The Share Insurance Fund of the Co-operative Central Bank provides for borrowings for liquidity purposes and is available to all co-operative member banks. Loan advances will generally be made on an unsecured basis provided that the aggregate loan balance is less than 5.0% of total deposits of the member bank; the member bank's primary capital ratio is in excess of 5.0%; the member bank meets the required CAMELS rating; and the quarterly and year-to-date net income before extraordinary items is positive. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.0 million of borrowing capacity with the Co-operative Central Bank, none of which was outstanding. 

    In August 2018, we issued $35.0 million in fixed to floating rate subordinated notes. The notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.625% until September 1, 2023 at which time the interest resets quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the three month LIBOR plus 278 basis points. The notes are carried on the consolidated balance sheet net of issuance costs of $1.2 million, which are being amortized over the period to maturity date.
     The Company also has an available line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston secured by 75.0% of the carrying value of indirect auto loans with an amortized balance amounting to $70.6 million of which no amount was outstanding at December 31, 2018.
     Supervision and Regulation
     General 
 The Bank is a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, a Massachusetts corporation that is a holding company. The Company is a registered bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the “BHCA,” and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks under Massachusetts law.
     As a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks under Massachusetts law. The Bank’s Rhode Island branches are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, Division of Banking, or the “RI Division of Banking.” The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and by the Share Insurance Fund established by Massachusetts General Laws for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. The Bank must also comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the “CFPB,” as enforced by the FDIC. Additionally, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may directly examine the subsidiaries of a bank holding company, including the Bank.
     The federal and state regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of other creditors or shareholders. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification 

 
  12

 
of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. 
     Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Bank and the Company. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company. 
     Regulation of the Company
 General. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA. As such, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, which has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices; to assess civil money penalties; and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
     Source of Strength. Under the BHCA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank. This support is required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide support to the Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
     Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank; acquiring control of a bank; merging or consolidating with another bank holding company; or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company.
     The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks.
     Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act would constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company.
     In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company; controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company; or the Federal Reserve has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company.

     Regulation of the Bank
 General. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the FDIC, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the RI Division of Banking. The FDIC, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the RI Division of Banking have the authority to issue orders to banks under their supervision to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of laws, regulations, or conditions imposed by, agreements with, or commitments to, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the RI Division of Banking. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the RI Division of Banking are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate banking laws, orders or regulations.
     Deposit Insurance. The deposit obligations of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, or the “DIF,” up to $250,000 per depositor. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or the “FDIA,” as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to take steps as may be necessary to cause the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits, the designated reserve ratio, to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and it mandates that the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC for any year may not be less than 1.35%. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act required that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset with credits the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets.
     To satisfy these requirements, in 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The final rule imposes on large banks a surcharge of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. Large banks, which are generally banks with $10 billion or more in assets, will pay quarterly surcharges in addition to their regular risk-based assessments. Overall regular risk-based assessment rates will decline once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. Small banks, such as the Bank, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment for each period when the ratio is at or above 1.38 percent.
     Deposit premiums are based on assets. To determine its deposit insurance premium, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate. In 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years. The rule utilizes the CAMELS rating system, which is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. To determine a bank’s assessment rate, each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings are multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products is added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating). This method takes into account various measures, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small banks with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 or 5 range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 range from 3 to 30 basis points.
     The FDIC has the authority to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. For 2018, the FDIC insurance expense for the Bank was $1.6 million.
    
Co-operative Central Bank and Share Insurance Fund. HarborOne Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and by the Share Insurance Fund established by Massachusetts General Laws for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. All Massachusetts-chartered co-operative banks are required to be members of the Co-operative Central Bank, which maintains the Share Insurance Fund that insures co-operative bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Co-operative Central Bank is authorized to charge co-operative banks an annual assessment fee on deposit balances in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC. Assessment rates are based on the institution’s risk category. For 2018, the Bank’s assessment was $492,000, and for 2019, the Bank’s assessment is $220,000.
     Acquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the FDIC is required in order for the Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks 

 
  14

 
in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, to establish new branches on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branches.
     Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the types of equity investments an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank, such as the Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such a bank may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the GLBA permits national banks and state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage via financial subsidiaries in certain activities that are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be “well capitalized,” and such banks must comply with certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other requirements.
     Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions, other than those in the lowest risk category, that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total deposits will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are “well capitalized” and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. Additionally, depository institutions considered “adequately capitalized” that need regulatory approval to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposits are subject to additional restrictions on the interest rate they may pay on deposits. Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the “Growth Act,” which was enacted on May 24, 2018, amends Section 29 of the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions. Specifically, the Growth Act provides that reciprocal deposits received by an agent depository institution that places deposits (other than those obtained by or through a deposit broker) with a deposit placement network are not considered to be funds obtained by or through a deposit broker to the extent the total amount of such reciprocal deposits does not exceed the lesser of $5 billion or 20% of the depository institution’s total liabilities. However, a depository institution that is less than well capitalized may not accept or roll over such excluded reciprocal deposits at a rate of interest that is significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its market area or a national rate cap established by the FDIC.
     Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA requires the FDIC to evaluate the Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire community it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The FDIC’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit the Bank or the Bancorp from undertaking certain activities, including engaging in activities newly permitted as a financial holding company under GLBA and acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Bank has achieved a rating of “Outstanding” on its most recent examination. Massachusetts has also enacted a similar statute that requires the Commissioner to evaluate the performance of the Bank in helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community and to take that record into account in considering certain applications.
     Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of the Bank, be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Bank.
     Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Bank’s required reserves can be in the form of vault cash and, if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Federal Reserve regulations currently require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts 

 
  15

 
except for transaction accounts up to $16.3 million, which are exempt. Transaction accounts greater than $16.3 million up to $124.2 million have a reserve requirement of 3.0%, and those greater than $124.2 million have a reserve requirement of approximately $3.2 million plus 10% of the amount over $124.2 million. The Federal Reserve generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered reserves. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. 
     Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Boston, which is one of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the FHLB System. Each FHLB serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLB, HarborOne Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2018, HarborOne Bank was in compliance with this requirement. Based on redemption provisions of the FHLB, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. HarborOne Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLB stock. As of December 31, 2018, no impairment has been recognized.
     At its discretion, the FHLB may declare dividends on the stock. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the FHLB of Boston paid quarterly dividends with an annual yield of 3.63%, 4.14%, and 5.56% respectively. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the FHLBs also will not cause a decrease in the value of the FHLB stock held by the Bank. 
     Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness
     Regulatory Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Bank and the Company. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between a banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
     The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 elements, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital.
     Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned one of several categories of risk weights based primarily on relative risk. Under the Federal Reserve’s rules that are applicable to the Company and the FDIC’s capital rules applicable to the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions of more than 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The capital conservation buffer became fully phased in on January 1, 2019.
     Under the FDIC’s prompt corrective action rules, an FDIC-supervised institution is considered well capitalized if it (i) has a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. The Bank is considered well capitalized under this definition.
     Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets and (v) require prior regulatory 

 
  16

 
approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
     Current capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater; and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.
     Section 201 of the Growth Act directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish a community bank leverage ratio of tangible capital to average total consolidated assets of not less than 8% or more than 10%. The legislation provides that a qualifying community bank, which the legislation defines as a depository institution or depository institution holding company with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, that exceeds the community bank leverage ratio shall be considered to have met the generally applicable leverage capital requirements and the generally applicable risk-based capital requirements. In addition, a depository institution that exceeds the community bank leverage ratio will be regarded as having met the capital ratio requirements that are required in order to be considered well capitalized under Section 38 of the FDIA. The federal banking agencies may exclude institutions from availing themselves of this relief based on the institution’s risk profile, taking into account off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, total notional derivatives exposures, and such other factors as the federal banking agencies determine appropriate. The federal banking agencies have proposed a community bank leverage ratio of 9%, which means that qualifying institutions with a community bank leverage ratio exceeding 9% would be eligible for the relief provided by Section 201 of the Growth Act. The federal banking agencies have also proposed excluding from this relief institutions with levels of off-balance sheet exposures, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets exceeding certain levels as well as all advanced approaches banking organizations.
     Safety and Soundness Standard. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, and compensation and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
     Dividend Restrictions
     The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The revenue of the Company (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from dividends paid to it by the Bank and the Company’s other subsidiaries. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries through the payment of dividends or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including, with respect to the Bank, depositors of the Bank, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
     Restrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s

capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer. See “—Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness–Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.
     Restrictions on Bank Dividends. The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. The payment of dividends by a bank is also restricted pursuant to various state regulatory limitations.
     Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates
     There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of affiliate to include an investment fund for which the depository institution or one of its affiliates is an investment adviser. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be on market terms and not otherwise unduly favorable to the holding company or an affiliate of the holding company. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any service.     Consumer Protection Regulation
     The Bank and the Company are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Home Ownership Protection Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, or the “FACT Act,” the GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act, or “TILA,” the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with clients when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The Federal Reserve examines the Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to the Bank.
     Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of TILA as a defense to foreclosure proceedings. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer. The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. The Growth Act included provisions that ease certain requirements related to mortgage transactions for certain small institutions, which are generally those with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets.

 Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, the Bank must provide its clients with an initial and annual disclosure that explains its policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, the Bank is prohibited from disclosing such information unless otherwise provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and practices since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that the Bank develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of client information (as defined under GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any client. The Bank is also required to send a notice to clients whose “sensitive information” has been compromised if unauthorized use of the information is “reasonably possible.” Most states, including the states in which the Bank operates, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and the duties of the Bank in response to a data breach. In addition, Massachusetts has promulgated data security regulations with respect to personal information of Massachusetts residents. Pursuant to the FACT Act, the Bank has developed and implemented a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
     Anti-Money Laundering
     The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, or “BSA,” a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve at least $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the “USA PATRIOT Act,” which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or effect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their correspondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.”
     OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or “OFAC,” take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country, or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on certain transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
     Federal Securities Laws 
     Our common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Exchange Act.      Emerging Growth Company Status 
     We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business startups Act of 2012. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other 

 
  19

 
public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, and an exemption from having outside auditors attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. 
     We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from when the Company went public. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering in 2016, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.
