Industry Trends and Competitive Advantages
 
We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from emerging trends and to help our clients adapt to a large and rapidly expanding and evolving investment industry. Investing has grown in complexity, with more choices across asset classes, security types and geographies, and more consideration of a wider array of risks, including those related to ESG and climate. In addition, the construction and management of investment portfolios are becoming increasingly outcome-oriented, rules-based and technology-driven. As a result, the investment process is transforming, reflected in several trends we have observed, including: 

• | Changing client operating models and business strategies, driven in part by fee compression, changing demographics, the regulatory environment and shifting economic outlooks;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing use of global, multi-asset-class and other complex investment strategies, including strategies incorporating private asset investments and factor objectives, as investors seek specific and unique outcomes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerating integration of ESG and climate considerations into investment processes, reporting and products, as sustainable investing becomes more prominent and investors increasingly focus on companies with strong sustainability practices as an indicator of long-term resilience, as seen in the current investment focus on considerations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather events and diversity and inclusion initiatives;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing growth of indexed investing through indexed investment products such as ETFs, mutual/UCITS funds and annuities, as well as indexed derivatives such as futures, options, structured products and over-the-counter swaps, and other vehicles that seek to track an index as investors increasingly seek lower-cost investment strategies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing allocation of capital to real estate and other private assets and desire for greater transparency into the performance of private assets, with an increased focus on climate and income risk;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing demand for data and tools that clients can integrate to support their unique portfolio construction needs and to provide transparency into their investment objectives; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing use of advanced technologies to enhance investment analytics, streamline operations, create efficiencies and gain competitive advantages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the following competitive advantages position us well to meet client demands in light of these trends:
 
 
• | Differentiated research-enhanced content provides our clients with insights to better understand and adapt to a complex and fast-changing marketplace. We are continually developing a wide range of differentiated content and have amassed an extensive database of historical global market data, proprietary equity index data, ESG and climate data, factor models, private assets benchmark data and risk algorithms, all of which can be critical components of our clients’ investment processes. This content is grounded in our deep knowledge of the global investment process and fueled by experienced research and product development and data management teams.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Client-centricity allows us to build strong client relationships globally and better understand and service our clients’ unique needs in the markets in which they operate. Our client coverage team develops and maintains strong and trusted relationships with senior executives and investment professionals, and we regularly consult with clients and other market participants to discuss their needs, investment trends and implications for our research, product development and client servicing goals.

Strategy
 We provide critical tools and solutions that enable investors to manage the transformations taking place in the investment industry, better understand performance and risk, and build portfolios more effectively and efficiently to achieve their investment objectives. We are focused on the following key initiatives to deliver actionable and integrated client solutions:
 
 
• | Extend leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes. We continue to develop and deliver innovative solutions that incorporate proprietary and highly differentiated content based on rich insights from our research and product development teams. In addition to continuing to enhance our position as a leader with respect to tools and solutions for equity investors globally, our strategic priorities also include content for ESG and climate, thematics, factors, fixed income, liquidity and private assets, all of which we believe represent significant growth opportunities. For example, in September 2021, we completed our acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. (“RCA”), a provider of data and analytics for the properties and transactions that drive the global commercial real estate capital markets. This transaction significantly expanded our data capabilities with respect to private assets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lead the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration by delivering the data, information and applications necessary to identify, assess and incorporate material ESG and climate risks and opportunities. The global adoption of ESG and climate-focused investment considerations is rapidly accelerating. As demand from our clients for ESG and climate solutions increases, MSCI’s research, tools and solutions will aim to provide the transparency our clients need to better integrate ESG and climate risks and opportunities into their investment processes. Our ESG ratings and climate data and research are also utilized in our index, analytics and private asset tools and solutions – from ESG and climate indexes to incorporation of ESG and climate data in risk analysis to climate and emissions assessments specific to real estate assets and private equity portfolios. We are focused on being an influential thought leader on these climate-related considerations for the investment industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance distribution and content-enabling technology. We are deploying and developing advanced technology to drive integration and efficiencies, accelerate the pace of innovation and enhance distribution and the client experience. We increasingly utilize proprietary and third-party technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing tools, to enhance our ability to gather and analyze data, create content and automate and enhance the efficiency of many of our data processes. In 2021, in response to evolving client needs and the changing technology landscape, we launched our new open-architecture Investment Solutions as a Service (“ISaaS”) offerings. These offerings include Climate Lab Enterprise, a first-in-kind visualization dashboard that combines our climate data with our analytical risk and portfolio management capabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand solutions that empower client customization. We will further enhance how we support our clients’ investment objectives by embedding our highly differentiated research into solutions that allow clients to incorporate their custom preferences. For example, we will leverage existing capabilities and applications to deliver solutions that will allow clients to reflect their unique risk and return, ESG and climate and thematic preferences, as well as tax optimization strategies in a scalable way.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strengthen client relationships and grow into strategic partnerships with clients. We aim to serve as a strategic partner to members of the investment community by anticipating their needs, by promoting the full breadth of our tools and solutions and by building a seamless experience across our offerings. The depth of knowledge of our client coverage teams, including dedicated account managers, ensures that we are engaging with our clients in a holistic and integrated manner. In particular, we are leveraging our existing offerings to serve new and developing client use cases. Through constant innovation, we enhance the efficiency and ease of use of our products as we further demonstrate the value of our content, applications and services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Execute strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. We regularly evaluate and selectively pursue strategic relationships with, and acquisitions of, providers of unique and differentiated content, products and technologies that we believe have the potential to complement, enhance or expand our offerings and client base. In order to drive value, we target acquisitions and strategic relationships that can be efficiently integrated into our existing operational structure and global sales network. For example, through our acquisition of RCA, we expanded MSCI’s robust suite of real estate solutions, by allowing us to provide real estate industry professionals with more data, analytics and support tools to manage investments and understand performance and risk, including climate risks, within their portfolios.

Financial Model
 
We have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue and strong cash generation. Clients purchase our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee arrangements, a business model which has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. Finally, our disciplined capital-allocation policy provides us with flexibility to balance internal resources and investment needs, acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had the following five operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Estate and The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”), which are presented as the following four reportable segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, and All Other – Private Assets. For reporting purposes, the Real Estate and Burgiss operating segments are combined and presented as All Other – Private Assets, as they did not meet the thresholds for separate presentation. The Burgiss operating segment represents the Company’s equity method investment in Burgiss. Financial results related to MSCI’s acquisition of RCA have been included prospectively as a component of the Real Estate operating segment and presented as a component of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment, commencing as of September 13, 2021 (the date we completed the acquisition).

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These indexes include stocks that demonstrate high exposure to the target factor.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Index segment also includes revenues from licenses of GICS and GICS Direct, the global industry classification standard jointly developed and maintained by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc.  This classification system was developed in response to investors’ need for a comprehensive and consistent framework for classifying companies into industries. GICS is widely accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation. GICS Direct is a dataset comprised of active companies and securities classified by sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry in accordance with the proprietary GICS methodology. The MSCI Sector Indexes are comprised of GICS sector, industry group, and industry indexes across countries and regions in Developed, Emerging and select Frontier markets. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, 61.3% of our revenues were attributable to our Index segment. A majority of those revenues were attributable to annual, recurring subscriptions. A portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products. Such fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management (“AUM”) or trading volumes and are referred to herein as asset-based fees. Since market movement and investment trends impact our asset-based fees, our revenues from asset-based fees are subject to volatility. For the year ended December 31, 2021, asset-based fees accounted for 44.3% of the total revenues for our Index segment.
 
Analytics 
 
Our Analytics segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risk across all major asset classes, spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. Our offerings also support clients’ various regulatory reporting needs. 
 
Our Analytics tools and capabilities include the following: models to support factor-based analytics (e.g., Barra equity models and fixed income and multi-asset class (“MAC”) models), pricing models and single security analytics, time series-based analytics, stress testing, performance attribution, portfolio optimization and liquidity risk analytics, as well as underlying inputs such as interest rate and credit curves. We continue to develop new and improved tools and capabilities in response to the evolving needs of our clients. In addition, our analytics capabilities are helping to fuel growth in key areas across our business, such as our factor indexes and many of our climate risk and reporting offerings.

Research and Product Development
 
We apply an integrated team approach to developing content across our operating segments. Our product management, research and product development, data operations and technology, and application development departments are at the center of this process. Our content is developed by a research and product development team comprised of mathematicians, economists, statisticians, financial engineers and investment industry experts.  Content created in one segment can often be used for the creation of products in another segment. For example, the MAC models created in our Analytics segment offer a view of risk across market and asset classes, including private real estate, by incorporating content generated in the Real Estate segment, and MSCI ESG indexes and our new Climate Lab Enterprise analytics product are constructed using data from our ESG and Climate segment. 
 
Through our relationships with the world’s largest investment institutions, we monitor investment trends and their drivers globally and support instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, portfolio attribution, asset allocation and VaR simulation. An important way we monitor global investment trends and their implications for our business is through direct public consultations and client advisory panels and through the forum provided by our Advisory Council. Our Advisory Council typically meets twice during the year to discuss current and emerging investment industry trends and is comprised of senior investment professionals from around the world and senior members of our research and product development team.

Competition
 
Index. Many industry participants compete with us by offering one or more indexes in similar categories. Such indexes vary widely in scope, including by geographic region, business sector and weighting methodology, and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world.  Among our Index competitors are S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (a joint venture of S&P Global Inc. and CME Group Inc.); FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group PLC; and Solactive AG.
 
Competition also exists from industry participants, including asset managers and investment banks, that create their own indexes, often in cooperation with index providers, which may, among other things, provide some form of calculation agent service. Some asset managers also manage funds, including ETFs, based on their proprietary indexes, and some investment banks launch structured products or create over-the-counter derivatives based on their proprietary indexes. This is often referred to as self-indexing.
 
Analytics. Our Analytics offerings compete with those from a range of competitors, including Qontigo (formerly Axioma Inc.), BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg Finance L.P., and FactSet Research Systems Inc. Additionally, some of the larger broker-dealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients. Similarly, some of the large global investment organizations, such as custodians, have developed internal risk management and performance analytics tools that they offer to their clients.
 
ESG and Climate. Our ESG and Climate offerings compete with a growing number of companies that issue ESG data, ratings or research. For example, our ESG and Climate offerings compete with those from a range of competitors, including Sustainalytics Holding B.V. (a part of Morningstar, Inc.), Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (majority owned by Deutsche Börse AG), Trucost (an S&P Global Inc. business) and Refinitiv (a London Stock Exchange Group business).
 
All Other – Private Assets.  We also have a variety of competitors for our other offerings that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues, including a growing number of companies that provide data, market intelligence, indexes, and performance and risk attribution services relating to real estate and other private assets. 
Intellectual Property, Other Proprietary Rights and Sources of Data
 
We consider many aspects of our offerings, processes and services to be proprietary. We have registered “MSCI” and other marks as trademarks or service marks in the United States and in certain other countries. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks as appropriate. From time to time, we have also filed patent applications to protect our proprietary rights. Additionally, many of our offerings, processes and services require the use of intellectual property that we license for use from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our offerings and services. Our ownership and protection of intellectual property and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use third-party intellectual property are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success. 
 
In addition to our intellectual property, we rely on third-party data to create and deliver our products and services. For example, we require certain stock exchange data to construct equity indexes. Termination of or 
 10


disputes regarding our rights to receive or use such data could limit the information available for us to use or distribute in connection with our products and services.  

Corporate Responsibility
 
As a leader in providing ESG and climate solutions to investors, we also aim to demonstrate leading corporate responsibility practices and policies that are meaningful to our various stakeholders, including our clients, employees, shareholders and local communities. The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our corporate responsibility strategy and activities. 
 
Recently we have implemented initiatives to reduce our impact on the environment and promote sustainability. We are committed to continuing to develop and enhance our climate-focused strategies. As part of our corporate responsibility efforts, in 2021 we published our first United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) report and our first Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) report. We have also published a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, a Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) report and a Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) report.

Human Capital Management
 MSCI is committed to creating a performance culture with high employee engagement. Our talent and leadership development programs are designed to ensure we have the people and skills in place to deliver on MSCI’s strategy, including a workplace that values and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion.
 The Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight over talent management matters, including efforts relating to our corporate culture, progression planning, career progression and retention strategies, and learning and leadership development programs. In addition, our Chief Human Resources Officer and our Chief Diversity Officer report to our Board on our initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion. We also engage with our shareholders around our talent initiatives, including our efforts to strengthen and promote a culture of inclusion and diversity. 
 The Board periodically reviews our executive talent including our leadership bench and succession planning. Our CEO and President also meet regularly with our functions to review talent plans with an aim to identify top talent who have the most potential to progress to the senior-most roles at MSCI.
 In January 2022, following an extensive organizational design assessment conducted in 2021, we announced a number of organization and senior leadership changes, as well as expanded our Executive Committee to reflect MSCI’s ambition to serve as an indispensable partner to clients and the investment community. This expansion brings together and elevates more of the senior leaders who drive MSCI’s strategy and operations into MSCI’s primary leadership committee. The new members of the Executive Committee increase the representation from operating functions, in particular, Research, Technology and Data, and Private Assets. Additional information on our Executive Committee can be found be found at https://www.msci.com/who-we-are/our-leadership.

MSCI is a global company with a highly diverse footprint. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 4,303 people, of which 47.4% of MSCI employees were located in the Asia Pacific region, 23.3% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 20.6% in the U.S. and Canada, and 8.7% in Mexico and Brazil.  For the one-year period ended December 31, 2021, voluntary turnover was 12.5% and involuntary turnover was 2.3%.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 At MSCI, diversity, equity and inclusion are core values of our culture. We strive to empower our people to maximize their potential in an environment where all individuals are respected and encouraged to bring their authentic selves to work. This culture embraces diverse experiences and perspectives, which we believe foster creativity and innovation. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 35.2% of our global employees, and people of color (defined as those who identify as Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian 
 11


or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander or two or more races) represented 46.1% of our U.S. employees and 41.6% of our U.S. employees in management roles5. The U.S. represents 9.9% of our global workforce.
 
In 2021, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, who is responsible for operating across MSCI to align our diversity, equity and inclusion goals with business outcomes. Our Executive Diversity Council (the “EDC”) champions a diverse and inclusive culture by advising on corporate initiatives and facilitating collaboration across MSCI. Members of the EDC partner with our employee resource groups (the Women’s Leadership Forum, Women in Tech, MSCI Pride, the Black Leadership Network, Asian Support Network (formed in 2021), All Abilities Network (formed in 2021) and Hola! MSCI (formed in 2021)) to raise awareness, conduct events around the globe and serve as sponsors in their respective locations.
 
Our Employer Brand Council and the Diversity Engagement and Sourcing team focus on:
 
 
• | building and communicating the MSCI employer brand with the aim of bringing to life and showcasing our culture;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attracting and developing diverse talent for current and future roles;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | building early career and internal pipeline programs that focus on diversity and inclusion across a range of factors, including gender, race, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and socio-economic considerations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | forging relationships at institutions worldwide that promote diversity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | building relationships with external partners and increasing our visibility (including through the use of social media) to better position MSCI’s programs and opportunities with new networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The team not only aims to create a pipeline of diverse talent for MSCI but also works to position MSCI more broadly as a leading organization that puts diversity, equity and inclusion at the center of its strategy. We believe that a diverse team is a stronger team and an important part of our success.

Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
 We offer a broad range of highly competitive compensation and benefits programs to our employees and their families, including same-sex domestic partners. These programs include health and welfare benefits, including an Employee Assistance Program; enhanced maternity and paternity leave policies, including a Global Minimum Standard applicable to all offices worldwide; contributions to defined contribution and defined benefit pensions plans globally and Health Savings Accounts in the U.S.; life insurance; a global wellness initiative that can help employees improve their health and well-being; presentations on well-being topics, including retirement planning, parenting, meditation, stress management and nutrition; ergonomic equipment and desk assessments; and wellness rooms in all MSCI office locations.
 
Compensation at MSCI supports a culture of high performance and accountability. Our goal is to provide competitive compensation in the markets where we compete for talent. We believe in linking all employee compensation to Company, Product/Function and individual performance by making 100% of our employees eligible for annual cash bonuses. We strongly differentiate cash bonus payouts based on actual results against goals and for managers, how effectively they demonstrate behaviors consistent with our values and culture.
 
Senior employees of the Company and select other employees are eligible to participate in the MSCI Long-Term Incentive Program with awards of MSCI stock that vest over a multi-year period. The goal of the Long-Term Incentive Program is to: (i) align the interests of eligible employees with those of our shareholders, (ii) enhance our “owner-operator” philosophy, (iii) recognize and reward potential long-term contributions, (iv) retain key leaders and top performers.
 
In June 2020, MSCI announced an innovation initiative called the Future of Work at MSCI, and we began implementing this initiative in January 2022. For most of our employees, the Future of Work introduced a hybrid work environment allowing employees to work at times at the office and other times remotely, depending on the requirements of a specific role. As we continue to adapt and iterate how we work, employee feedback will remain central to this initiative.
 
Cultivating Talent and Employee Engagement 
 MSCI is committed to investing in employee learning and development. Throughout the year, we offer tools and workshops to help employees better understand how their work aligns with MSCI’s overall strategy, seek and receive real-time and transparent feedback and coaching, successfully deliver on their goals, and more effectively plan and develop their careers.
 
MSCI conducts an employee engagement survey at least annually that measures whether our approaches to performance, growth and career development are driving employee engagement. Managers receive anonymous feedback and are accountable for improving and enhancing the work environment to drive higher engagement. In our December 2021 employee engagement survey, we achieved a 79% response rate and the percentage of respondents characterized as fully engaged equaled the highest since we implemented the engagement survey (not including employees from RCA, a newly acquired business).

Supporting our Employees Through COVID-19
 The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we immediately implemented an employee communication strategy that was direct, transparent and inclusive. Through townhalls, firmwide e-mail communications and broad cross-functional meetings, management delivered key messages around employee safety and well-being, leadership, remaining productive, engaging with clients, promoting community and having empathy for others. We also increased communications around employee assistance programs that provide mental health and emotional well-being support, and resources to help manage stress and care for individuals and their families. Finally, we paid for or reimbursed employees for the cost of COVID-19 testing and enhanced our sick leave policies. 
 At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic our technology infrastructure allowed us to seamlessly transition to a remote work environment. We increased technology effectiveness to allow our employees to remain fully engaged, productive and well. We also provided individualized support and equipment to our employees as needed to facilitate productivity. We continue to closely monitor and manage the situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and follow the recommended practices and guidelines from the World Health Organization as well as local requirements where our offices are located globally.
 As noted above, in January 2022, we transitioned to our Future of Work at MSCI, which introduced increased flexibility to how and where employees work, reimagined our use of our offices and modernized technology to enhance MSCI’s interactions with clients and employees. For most of our employees, the Future of Work introduced a hybrid work environment allowing employees to work flexibly, sometimes at the office and other times remotely, based on the requirements of their specific roles. The Future of Work at MSCI unites our inclusive culture with modern ways of working to give employees the accountability, responsibility and empowerment to perform at their very best, while keeping our clients at the center of all we do. We believe these efforts will be iterative and adaptable, and feedback from our employees will be critical to ensure this initiative remains relevant and positions MSCI and its employees for success.
