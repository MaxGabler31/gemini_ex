General
 
Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. (“TLFA,” “we,” “our,” “us,” the” Company,” “Tandy,” or “Tandy Leather” mean Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., together with its subsidiaries) is one of the world’s largest specialty retailers of leather and leathercraft-related items.  Founded in 1919 in Fort Worth, Texas, the Company introduced leathercrafting to millions of American and later Canadian and other international customers and has built a track record as the trusted source of quality leather, tools, hardware, supplies, kits and teaching materials for leatherworkers everywhere.  Today, our mission remains to build on our legacy of inspiring the timeless art and trade of leatherworking.
 
What differentiates Tandy from the competition is our high brand awareness and strong brand equity and loyalty, our network of retail stores that provides convenience, a high-touch customer service experience, and a hub for the local leathercrafting community, and our 100-year heritage.  We believe that this combination of qualities is unique to Tandy and gives the brand competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate.
 
We sell our products primarily through company-owned stores and through orders generated from our four websites: tandyleather.com, tandyleather.ca, tandyleather.eu and tandyleather.com.au. We also manufacture leather lace, cut leather pieces and most of the do-it-yourself kits that are sold in our stores and on our websites.  We also offer production services to our business customers such as cutting (“clicking”), splitting, and some assembly.  We maintain our principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140.
 
The Company’s common shares currently trade on the OTC Pink Market operated by OTC Markets Group under the symbol “TLFA.”
 


 
Retail Fleet
 
The Company currently operates a total of 106 retail stores.  There are 95 stores in the U.S., ten stores in Canada and one store in Spain.
 
All Tandy locations, other than our corporate headquarters (which includes our flagship store, corporate offices, distribution center, and manufacturing facility) are leased.
 
Business Strategy
 
Tandy Leather has been introducing people to leatherworking for over 100 years.  Our stores have been and continue to be our competitive advantage: where our consumers learn the craft in classes, open table, and from the expertise of our store staff, where they can touch, feel and test the product, and where they can connect and commune with others passionate about leather.  Our website provides inspiration, detailed product descriptions and specifications, educational information and videos, and a convenient place to also purchase product – especially for those who are far from our retail stores, including a growing international customer base.  For many of our retail and web customers, leatherworking evolves from a passion to a trade.  Our Commercial Division is tailored to the needs of those customers who build businesses around leather.  With dedicated direct account representatives, a direct-from-our-warehouse shipping model, bulk and volume-based competitive pricing, customized product development, and production and pre-production services, we are building long-term, strategic relationships with our largest customers.
 
Our focus over the last three years has been on three broad strategic initiative areas:
 

1. | Improving our brand proposition, with both Retail and Commercial customers
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Rebuilding our foundation – the talent, processes, tools and systems needed to serve these customers
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Position us for long-term growth – creating the vision and roadmap for the future
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Despite the unforeseen obstacles of the financial restatement and the COVID-19 pandemic, we have made significant progress against these initiatives.  Some key accomplishments include:
 

■ | Significantly improving the product quality, breadth of assortment and value
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Reinventing the pricing architecture/strategy to simplify it, provide great everyday value and also the excitement of sale
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Improving the quality, clarity and efficiency of the marketing collateral and mix
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Relaunching and dramatically improving the website; centralizing web fulfillment
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Significantly improving the Retail organization and skills: new team, training, career paths, incentives
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Launching the Commercial Division: a completely new business model tailored to the needs of the largest customers
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Recruiting, developing and retaining the right team for the work ahead; creating a collaborative, performance-based culture
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Building people management infrastructure: performance evaluations, benefits, communications, recognition, incentives, training
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Replacing and significantly upgrading general ledger, warehouse management and point-of-sale systems
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Developing a robust counter-sourcing program for product and supplies
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Reorganizing and improving factory and warehouse capabilities
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Creating a roadmap for future growth
--+-------------------------------------

 


 
COVID-19 and Outlook
 
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 temporarily shifted our strategic focus to company survival and cash preservation.  We began closing stores on March 18, 2020, and by April 2, 2020, we temporarily closed all stores to the public.  While we pivoted to serve customers only online, the Company experienced significant decreases in demand for its products in the second and third quarters of 2020, negatively impacting net sales.
 
In response, we took immediate action to mitigate the impact of temporary store closures on our cash flows by: (i) furloughing 406 Tandy employees, comprising two-thirds of the Tandy work force, (ii) temporarily cutting corporate salaries, with deeper cuts for the Executive Leadership Team, (iii) negotiating abatements, deferrals and other favorable lease terms with landlords, and (iv) negotiating longer payment terms with our key product vendors.
 
Due to our size, we were not eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program administered through the Small Business Administration.  Also, due to our not being current on financial filings with the SEC, we were not able to obtain loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act.  However, under the CARES Act we were eligible to participate in the payroll tax deferral program, and we deferred $0.6 million in payroll tax with $0.3 million to be paid by December 31, 2021, and the remaining $0.3 million to be paid by December 31, 2022.  During the second quarter of 2020, the Company borrowed $0.4 million through the Spanish government’s Institute of Official Credit Guarantee for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, a COVID-19 relief program.  In Canada, we participated in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (“CECRA”) program for rent relief, receiving total rent abatements under the program of $0.05 million.
 
Nine stores were permanently closed during 2020 as leases expired or early terminations were negotiated, including at locations where we believe we can retain a majority of customers through geographically proximate stores and/or our enhanced website platform.  After these permanent closures, Tandy operates 106 stores, including ten in Canada and one in Spain.
 
On May 22, 2020, our Fort Worth flagship store reopened to the public, the beginning of a phased approach to reopening our stores with limited hours, new protocols for sanitizing, social distancing, wearing masks and taking daily temperatures of employees.  During the third quarter of 2020, all 106 of Tandy’s stores had reopened to the public.  Since then, various spikes in local infection rates  have forced us to sporadically move stores to short-term “curbside only” operations or closures due to local conditions or staffing issues.  We expect that at least some further infections and temporary store shutdowns will continue for the foreseeable future.
 
While we previously fulfilled our web orders out of our retail stores, during the second quarter of 2020, we built a centralized web fulfillment capability in our Fort Worth distribution center and have been and expect to continue to fulfill web orders primarily through Fort Worth going forward.  Both our e-commerce business and stores have seen strong sales performance, but the future remains uncertain, and more store closures and/or other ongoing effects of the pandemic on the economy or employment market could cause a material negative impact on future sales.
 


 
Customers
 
Our customers fall into 2 broad categories:  those who shop in retail stores and on our website (“Retail Customers”) and those whom we serve through our Commercial Division (“Commercial Customers”).  Retail Customers range from hobbyists to institutions like schools, camps, and other groups to small businesses.  Affinity groups like Military and First Responders and smaller and larger businesses who purchase in our retail stores receive special pricing or general discounts.  To be served through our Commercial Division, customers generally need to spend more than $20,000 per year and receive pricing based on their purchasing levels.
Merchandise
 
We carry a wide assortment of products organized into a number of categories including leather, hand tools, hardware, kits, liquids, machinery and other supplies.  We operate a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, where we manufacture kits, thread lace, belt strips and straps, and Craftaid®s, and provide some custom manufacturing processes for commercial and business customers.  The factory produces approximately 10% of our products.  We distribute product under the Tandy LeatherTM, Eco-FloTM, CraftoolTM, CraftoolProTM and Dr. Jackson’sTM brands, along with our recently launched TandyPro® products.  We develop and invest in new products through the ideas and referrals of customers and store personnel as well as the analysis of trends in the market and sales performance at retail.  In addition, we have been focused on broadening our assortment through strategic partnerships with key brands to drive category growth and better meet the needs of our customers.
Operations
 
Information regarding net sales, gross profit, operating income, and total assets is included within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 
Our stores offer a broad selection of products combined with leathercraft expertise in a one-stop shop.  Not only can customers purchase leather, related accessories and supplies necessary to complete their projects from a single source, but many of our store associates are also leathercrafters themselves and can provide suggestions and advice on our customers’ projects.  Customers value the expertise and high level of customer service from our store associates, the convenience of taking their purchases immediately, as well as the ability to touch, feel and choose their individual pieces of leather, an organic product in which each piece is unique.  We also offer open workbenches where customers can work on projects, take classes, commune with the leathercrafting community, and test new tools and techniques.
 
Most of our stores range in size from 1,300 square feet to 9,000 square feet, with the average at approximately 3,500 square feet, and our Fort Worth flagship store is approximately 22,000 square feet.  Stores are located in light industrial warehouse spaces or older strip shopping centers in proximity to major freeways or well-known crossroads.  We believe that many of our customers view our stores as a destination: customers interested in leathercrafting seek us out, reducing the value of paying high rents for high foot-traffic locations.
 
Historically, we generate slightly more sales in the fourth quarter of each year due to the holiday shopping season (approximately 28-30% of annual sales), while the other three quarters average approximately 22-24% of annual sales each quarter.
 


 
Distribution
 
Our stores receive the majority of their inventory from our central distribution center located in Fort Worth, Texas, in weekly or, increasingly, bi-monthly shipments, using third party logistics providers.  Occasionally, merchandise is shipped to stores directly from the vendor.  We now fulfill all of our U.S. and many of our International web orders from our Fort Worth distribution center.  Canada web orders are fulfilled out of our 10 Canada stores, and European web orders are fulfilled out of our Spain store.  We have a global customer service team that handles web order inquiries and phone orders.  Our goal is to optimize the tradeoff between the sales and market share we realize from having a broad product line against the safety stock required to support those items .  We generally maintain higher inventories of imported or long-lead-time items, to ensure a continuous supply. Our inventory levels have grown as we have increased our product assortment to improve conversion and retention of customers and to mitigate out-of-stocks, especially during the supply chain disruptions over the last 2 years.  We have also been executing a number of strategic initiatives to test smaller quantities of new items online, buying into them only when we are certain of their success, tailor product assortments to the needs of local customers in each store, and to ship directly from vendors to customers.  We carry about 6,500 stock-keeping units (SKUs) in our current product line and continue to refine both the line, the lead times and safety stock levels required to meet customer demand, online vs. in-store assortment, and overall total inventory levels needed to grow sales and market share.
Competition
 
Our competitors are typically smaller, independently-owned brick-and-mortar retailers, internet-based retailers including those selling on platforms like Amazon and eBay, national craft chains like Michaels Stores, Inc. and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., and some wholesale-focused distributors.  Virtually all of these competitors carry a more limited line of leathercraft products compared to Tandy.  We are competitive on convenience, price, availability of merchandise, customer service, depth of our product line, and delivery time.  Tandy Leather is the only multi-store chain specializing in leathercraft, which we believe provides a competitive advantage over internet-based retailers and the large general craft retailers.  We also believe that our large size relative to most competitors gives us an advantage in sourcing as well as deep product and leathercrafting expertise among our employees.
Suppliers
 
We purchase merchandise and raw materials from over 170 vendors from the United States and approximately 20 foreign countries.  In general, our 10 largest vendors account for approximately 60-75% of our inventory purchases.
 
Because leather is sold internationally, market conditions abroad are likely to affect the price of leather in the United States.  Aside from increasing purchases when we anticipate price increases (or possibly delaying purchases if we foresee price declines), we do not attempt to hedge our inventory costs.
 
Our supply chain and vendor relationships remain strong.  We are focused on continuing to align our product and sourcing strategies to elevate the overall quality, consistency, and agility to meet the diverse needs of our existing consumers and attract new ones to the brand.  COVID-19 has had varying impacts on our supply chain, as the course of the disease has impacted countries differently over time.  We continue to see product price increases and longer lead-times across most product categories due to container and/or raw material scarcity and labor shortages.  We are also beginning to see the impact of higher energy prices on both product and freight costs as well.  We invested heavily in inventory of key items, especially in leather and hardware, over the last 12 months at 2020 prices.  We believe we will be well-positioned to wait out any short-term price hikes for some months.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed 593 people, 492 of whom were employed on a full-time basis.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  Overall, we believe that relations with employees are good.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all Tandy-branded products.  In addition, we license a limited number of our trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition co-branded projects.  Major trademarks include federal trade name registrations for “Tandy Leather Factory,” “Tandy Leather Company,” and “Tandy.”  The Company is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent, although it believes that the “Tandy” and “Tandy Leather” names are important for its business.  In addition, Tandy owns several patents for specific belt buckles and leather-working equipment.  Tandy polices its trademarks and trade dress and where appropriate pursues infringers.  The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them.
