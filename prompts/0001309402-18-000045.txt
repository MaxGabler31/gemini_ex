 Item 1.  Business. 
 ﻿
 References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Green Plains,” or the “company” refer to Green Plains Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains is an Iowa corporation, founded in June 2004 as an ethanol producer. We have grown through acquisitions of operationally efficient ethanol production facilities and adjacent commodity processing businesses. We are focused on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and risk management strategy. We own and operate assets throughout the ethanol value chain: upstream, with grain handling and storage; through our ethanol production facilities; and downstream, with marketing and distribution services to mitigate commodity price volatility, which differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production. Our other businesses, including our partnership, cattle feeding operations and vinegar production, leverage our supply chain, production platform and expertise.
 ﻿
 We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to be our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. The partnership completed its IPO on July 1, 2015. We own a 62.5% limited partner interest, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of the partnership’s incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements.
 ﻿
 We group our business activities into the following four operating segments to manage performance: 
 ﻿

· | Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production segment includes the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at 17 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. At capacity, our facilities are capable of processing approximately 518 million bushels of corn per year and 2 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


producing approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol, 4.1 million tons of distillers grains and 359 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil, making us the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol plants in North America.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Agribusiness and Energy Services. Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement, with approximately 59.6 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, crude oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Food and Ingredients. Our food and ingredients segment includes four cattle feeding operations with the capacity to support approximately 258,000 head of cattle and grain storage capacity of approximately 9.6 million bushels, Fleischmann’s Vinegar, one of the world’s largest producers of food-grade industrial vinegar, and our food-grade corn oil operations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Partnership. Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership’s assets include 39 ethanol storage facilities, eight fuel terminal facilities and approximately 3,500 leased railcars.

Risk Management and Hedging Activities    ﻿
 Our profitability is highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, corn, natural gas and cattle. Since market price fluctuations among these commodities are not always correlated, ethanol production or our cattle feeding operations may be unprofitable at times. We use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to monitor real-time operating price risk exposure at each of our operations to obtain favorable margins, when available, or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. Our multiple businesses and revenue streams also help to diversify our operations and improve profitability.
 ﻿
 We use forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and vinegar production or buy some of the corn, natural gas, cattle, or ethanol we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, ethanol, cattle and other commodities. The financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver those commodities. We do not speculate on general price movements by taking significant unhedged positions on commodities.
 ﻿
 Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying commodity and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn, natural gas and feeder cattle and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and live cattle. Depending on the circumstance, we vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all.
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We are focused on managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams. Our competitive strengths include: 
 ﻿
 Disciplined Risk Management.  Risk management is our core competency and we use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to maintain a disciplined approach. Our internally developed operating margin management system allows us to monitor commodity price risk exposure at each of our operations and lock in favorable margins or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. 
 ﻿
 Acquisition and Integration Capabilities.  We have a history of acquiring assets that create synergies and diversifying risks. Our balance sheet allows us to be opportunistic in that process. Since inception, we built or acquired 17 ethanol plants and installed corn oil extraction technology at each of our ethanol plants to generate incremental returns. In addition, we purchased or built a grain handling and storage business, cattle feeding operations, a vinegar production business, and terminal and distribution facilities. Successful integration of these operations has enhanced our overall returns.
 ﻿

Operational Excellence.  Our facilities are staffed with experienced industry personnel who share operational knowledge and expertise. We focus on making incremental operational improvements to enhance performance using real-time production data and systems to monitor our operations and optimize performance. Our operational expertise provides us a cost advantage over most of our competitors and helps us improve the operating margins of acquired facilities. 
 ﻿
 Vertical Integration.  Our vertically integrated platform reduces commodity and operational risk and increases pricing visibility in key markets. Combined, our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, food and ingredients, and partnership segments provide efficiencies, which extend both within and outside the ethanol value chain.
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Our senior management team averages approximately 25 years of commodity risk management and related industry experience. We have specific expertise across all of our businesses, including plant operations and management, commodity markets and risk management, and ethanol marketing and distribution. Our management team’s level of operational and financial expertise is essential to successfully executing our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by heightened environmental concerns and energy independence goals, supported by government policies and regulations. In the 1990’s, federal law required the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline to reduce vehicle emissions in cities with unhealthy levels of air pollution. Today, ethanol is the primary oxygenate used by the U.S. refining industry to meet various federal and state air emission standards. The high octane value of ethanol has also made it the primary additive used by refiners to increase octane value, which improves engine performance. Accordingly, ethanol has become a valuable blend component that comprises approximately 10% of the domestic gasoline supply with the potential to grow with higher blends and increased gasoline demand. Ethanol usage is further supported by federal government mandates under RFS, which assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. Advances in domestic corn yields have helped the U.S. ethanol industry become the lowest-cost producer of ethanol, surpassing Brazil, creating demand for U.S. ethanol worldwide.
 ﻿
 In light of the ethanol industry’s environment, we are focused on maintaining a low-cost ethanol production platform and driving costs out of the value chain through disintermediation. Owning grain storage at or near our ethanol plants allows us to develop relationships with local producers and originate corn more effectively at a lower average cost. We purchase approximately two-thirds of our corn volume directly from farmers and have 42 production days of storage capacity at or near our ethanol plants. We use our performance data to develop strategies that can be applied across our platform and embrace technological advances to improve operational efficiencies and yields, such as Selective Milling Technology™ and Enogen® corn enzyme technology, to lower our processing cost per gallon and increase production volumes.
 ﻿
 We believe there is untapped value across our businesses and we intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:
 ﻿
 Grow Organically: We seek to identify expansion projects that maximize our production capabilities and lower existing costs at our production facilities.  We also seek to leverage our core competencies in adjacent businesses such as cattle feedlots, high protein animal feed, food ingredients and other commodity processing operations that maximize our operational and risk management expertise.
 ﻿
 Acquire Strategic Assets: We intend to invest in downstream distribution services that take advantage of our master limited partnership structure, leverage our core competencies in adjacent markets or generate attractive margins or predictable revenue streams. We are disciplined throughout the business development process to ensure our investments generate favorable returns and are firmly committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2017. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 On March 10, 2017, we acquired the assets of a cattle-feeding operation located approximately 20 miles from our Hereford, Texas ethanol facility. The operation has the capacity to support 30,000 head of cattle and is included in our food and ingredients segment.

On April 28, 2017, Green Plains Cattle amended its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to finance the expanded working capital requirements for its cattle feeding operations. The amendment increased the maximum commitment from $100.0 million to $200.0 million until July 31, 2017, when it was increased again to $300.0 million. The maturity date was extended from October 31, 2017 to April 30, 2020.
 ﻿
 On May 16, 2017, we completed the acquisition of two cattle-feeding operations from Cargill Cattle Feeders, LLC for $37.2 million, excluding working capital adjustments. The transaction included the feed yards located in Leoti, Kansas and Eckley, Colorado and added combined feedlot capacity of 155,000 head of cattle to our operations. The transaction was financed using cash on hand. As part of the transaction, we entered into a long-term cattle supply agreement with Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation. Under the cattle supply agreement, all cattle placed in the Leoti, Kansas, Eckley, Colorado and Kismet, Kansas feedlots will be sold exclusively to Cargill Meat Solutions under an agreed upon production and pricing arrangement. 
 ﻿
 During the second quarter of 2017, we entered into several privately negotiated agreements with holders, on behalf of certain beneficial owners, of our 3.25% notes. Under these agreements, 2,783,725 shares of our common stock and approximately $8.5 million in cash plus accrued but unpaid interest on the 3.25% notes, were exchanged for approximately $56.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 3.25% notes. Following the closing of the agreement, $63.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.25% notes remains outstanding. We recorded a charge to interest expense in the consolidated financial statements for the loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $1.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017.
 ﻿
 On July 28, 2017, we amended our Green Plains Trade senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, to increase the maximum commitment from $150.0 million to $300.0 million and extend the maturity date to July 28, 2022. The amended credit facility increases advance rates and modifies the eligible inventory definitions to include additional commodities and locations. Advances are subject to variable interest rates equal to a daily LIBOR rate plus 2.25% or the base rate plus 1.25%. The unused portion of the credit facility is also subject to a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum.
 ﻿
 On August 29, 2017, the company entered into a $500.0 million term loan agreement which matures on August 29, 2023, to refinance approximately $405.0 million of total debt outstanding issued by Green Plains Processing and Fleischmann’s Vinegar, pay associated fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. The term loan is guaranteed by the company and substantially all of its subsidiaries, but not Green Plains Partners and certain other entities, and secured by substantially all of the assets of the company, including 17 ethanol production facilities, vinegar production facilities and a second priority lien on the assets secured under the revolving credit facilities at Green Plains Trade, Green Plains Cattle and Green Plains Grain. 
 ﻿
 On September 11, 2017, John Neppl joined the company as chief financial officer of Green Plains and Green Plains Partners, replacing Jerry Peters, who retired. Mr. Peters continues as a member of the board of directors of Green Plains Holdings LLC, the general partner of Green Plains Partners. Mr. Neppl most recently served as chief financial officer of The Gavilon Group, LLC and brings extensive experience in commodity processing and trading businesses.
 ﻿
 On October 27, 2017, the partnership upsized its revolving credit facility by $40.0 million, from $155.0 million to $195.0 million, accessing a portion of the $100.0 million accordion in place on the facility.
 ﻿
 On November 16, 2017, Green Plains Cattle entered into an amendment of its senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of the West and ING Capital LLC. This amendment increased the revolving commitment under the credit facility by $125.0 million, from $300.0 million to $425.0 million, with an additional $75.0 million available accordion feature. Additionally, the amendment increased the swing-line sublimit from $15.0 million to $20.0 million.
 ﻿
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, commercial development of the JGP Energy Partners intermodal export and import fuels terminal in Beaumont, Texas was completed, with storage capacity of 550 thousand barrels to support various export and domestic grades of ethanol. On December 4, 2017, the first ethanol shipment departed from the terminal. The company formed the 50/50 joint venture to construct the terminal in June 2016 with Jefferson Ethanol Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC. Per the omnibus agreement between Green Plains and the partnership, Green Plains will offer its interest in the joint venture to the partnership no later than six months after the completion of construction.
 ﻿
 During the year, the company repurchased 394,677 shares of common stock for $6.7 million.

Operating Segments
 ﻿
 Ethanol Production Segment
 ﻿
 Industry Overview. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is a colorless liquid produced by fermenting carbohydrates found in a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, and other cellulosic matter found in plants. Most of the ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because it contains large quantities of carbohydrates that convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass, which can be handled efficiently and is in greater supply than other grains. According to the USDA, on average, one bushel, or 56 pounds, of corn, produces approximately 2.7 gallons of ethanol, 17.5 pounds of distillers grains and 0.7 pounds of corn oil. Outside of the United States, sugarcane is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol.
 ﻿
 Ethanol is a significant component of the biofuels industry, which includes all transportation fuels derived from renewable biological materials. Biofuels are an excellent oxygenate and source of octane. When added to petroleum-based transportation fuels, oxygenates reduce vehicle emissions. Ethanol is the most economical oxygenate and source of octanes available on the market and its production costs are competitive with gasoline.
 ﻿
 Ethanol Plants. We operate 17 dry mill ethanol production plants, located in nine states, that produce ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil:

  ﻿

(1) | We constructed these four plants; all other ethanol plants were acquired.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. Miles driven typically increases during the spring and summer months related to vacation travel, followed closely behind the fall season due to holiday travel.
 ﻿
 The majority of our plants are equipped with industry-leading ICM or Delta-T ethanol processing technology. Our years of experience building, acquiring and operating these technologies provides us with a deep understanding of how to effectively and efficiently manage both platforms for maximum performance. 
 ﻿
 Corn Feedstock and Ethanol Production. Our plants use corn as feedstock in a dry mill ethanol production process. Each of our plants requires approximately 17 million to 43 million bushels of corn annually, depending on its production capacity. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations driven by a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs, freight costs and global demand. Ethanol producers are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to customers since ethanol competes with other fuels.
 ﻿
 Our corn supply is obtained primarily from local markets. We use cash and forward purchase contracts with grain producers and elevators to buy corn. We maintain direct relationships with local farmers, grain elevators and cooperatives, which serve as our primary sources of grain feedstock, at 14 of our ethanol plants. Most farmers in close proximity of our plants store corn in their own storage facilities. This allows us to purchase much of the corn we need directly from farmers

throughout the year. At three of our ethanol plants, we contract with a third-party grain originator to supply the corn necessary for ethanol production. These contracts terminate between August 2019 and November 2023. Each of our plants is also situated on rail lines or has other logistical solutions to access corn supplies from other regions of the country should local supplies become insufficient.
 ﻿
 Corn is received at the plant by truck or rail then weighed and unloaded into a receiving building. Grain storage facilities are used to inventory grain that is passed through a scalper to remove rocks and debris prior to processing. The corn is then transported to a hammer mill where it is ground into coarse flour and conveyed into a slurry tank for enzymatic processing. Water, heat and enzymes are added to convert the complex starch molecules into simpler carbohydrates. The slurry is heated to reduce the potential of microbial contamination and pumped into a liquefaction tank where additional enzymes are added. Next, the grain slurry is pumped into fermenters, where yeast, enzymes, and nutrients are added and the fermentation process is started. A beer column, within the distillation system, separates the alcohol from the spent grain mash. The alcohol is dehydrated to 200-proof alcohol and either pumped into a holding tank and blended with approximately 2% denaturant as it is pumped into finished product storage tanks, or marketed as undenatured ethanol.
 ﻿
 Distillers Grains. The spent grain mash is pumped from the beer column into a decanter-type centrifuge for dewatering. The water, or thin stillage, is pumped from the centrifuge into an evaporator, where it is dried into a thick syrup. The solids, or wet cake, that exit the centrifuge are conveyed to the dryer system and dried at varying temperatures to produce distillers grains. Syrup may be reapplied to the wet cake prior to drying to provide additional nutrients. Distillers grains, the principal co-product of the ethanol production process, are used as high-protein, high-energy animal feed and marketed to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries. 
 ﻿
 We can produce three forms of distillers grains, depending on the number of times the solids are passed through the dryer system:

· | wet distillers grains, which contain approximately 65% to 70% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three days and is therefore sold to dairies or feedlots within the immediate vicinity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | modified wet distillers grains, which is dried further to approximately 50% to 55% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three weeks and are marketed to regional dairies and feedlots; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dried distillers grains, which have been dried more extensively to approximately 10% to 12% moisture, have an almost indefinite shelf life and may be stored, sold and shipped to any market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

Corn Oil. Corn oil systems extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately before the production of distillers grains. Corn oil is produced by processing the syrup and evaporated thin stillage through a decanter-style, or disk-stack, centrifuge. The centrifuges separate the relatively light corn oil from the heavier components of the syrup, eliminating the need for significant retention time. We extract approximately 0.7 pounds of corn oil per bushel of corn used to produce ethanol. Industrial uses for corn oil include feedstock for biodiesel, livestock feed additives, rubber substitutes, rust preventatives, inks, textiles, soaps and insecticides. The syrup is blended into wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains.
 ﻿
 Natural Gas.  Depending on production parameters, our ethanol plants use approximately 20,000 to 40,000 BTUs of natural gas per gallon of production. We have service agreements to acquire the natural gas we need and transport the gas through pipelines to our plants.
 ﻿
 Electricity.  Our plants require between 0.5 and 1.5 kilowatt hours of electricity per gallon of production. Local utilities supply the necessary electricity to all of our ethanol plants.
 ﻿
 Water.  While some of our plants satisfy a majority of their water requirements from wells located on their respective properties, each plant also obtains drinkable water from local municipal water sources. Each facility either uses city water or operates a filtration system to purify the well water that is used for its operations. Local municipalities supply all of the necessary water for our plants that do not have onsite wells. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled in the production process.
 ﻿
 Agribusiness and Energy Services Segment
 ﻿
 Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes four grain elevators in four states with combined grain storage capacity of approximately 10.1 million bushels, and grain storage at our ethanol plants of approximately 49.5 million bushels, detailed in the following table:

  ﻿
 We buy bulk grain, primarily corn and soybeans, from area producers, and provide grain drying and storage services to those producers. At certain locations, the grain is used as feedstock for our ethanol plants or sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers. Bulk grain commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of grain, as well as grain held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times.
 ﻿
 Seasonality is present within our agribusiness operations. The fall harvest period typically results in higher handling margins and stronger financial results during the fourth quarter of each year.
 ﻿
 Through Green Plains Trade, we market the ethanol we and a third party produce to local, regional, national and international customers. We also purchase ethanol from independent producers for pricing arbitrage. We sell to various markets under sales agreements with integrated energy companies; retailers, traders and resellers in the United States and buyers for export to Brazil, Canada, Europe and other international markets. Under these agreements, ethanol is priced under fixed and indexed pricing arrangements. 
 ﻿

Also through Green Plains Trade, we market wet and modified wet distillers grains to local markets and dried distillers grains to local, national and international markets. The bulk of our demand is delivered to geographic regions that do not have significant local corn or distillers grains production.
 ﻿
 Our markets can be further segmented by geographic region and livestock industry. Most of our wet and modified wet distillers grains are sold to midwestern feedlot markets. A substantial amount of dried distillers grains are shipped by barge, containers and rail to regional and national markets, as well as international markets. Our dried distillers grains are shipped to feedlots and poultry markets, as well as Texas and West Coast rail markets. Some of our distillers grains are shipped by truck to dairy, beef, and poultry operations in the eastern United States. We also ship by railcar to eastern and southeastern feed mills, poultry and dairy operations, and domestic trade companies. We sell dried distillers grains directly to international markets and indirectly to exporters for shipment. In 2017, we exported approximately 9% of our distillers grains production, with the largest export markets for distillers grains being Vietnam and Thailand. Access to diversified markets allows us to sell product to customers offering the highest net price.

Our corn oil is sold primarily to biodiesel plants and, to a lesser extent, feedlot and poultry markets. We transport our corn oil by truck to locations in a close proximity to our ethanol plants primarily in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. We also transport corn oil by rail and barges to national markets as well as to exporters for shipment on vessels to international markets.
 ﻿
 Through Green Plains Trade, we provide marketing services of natural gas to our ethanol plants and to other third parties including the procurement of both the pipeline capacity and natural gas. We also enhance the value by aggregating volumes at various storage facilities which can be sold to either the plants or various intermediary markets and end markets.    
 ﻿
 Our railcar fleet for the agribusiness and energy services segment consists of approximately 920 leased hopper cars to transport distillers grains and approximately 100 leased tank cars to transport corn oil and crude oil. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years. 
 ﻿
 Food and Ingredients Segment
 ﻿
 Cattle feeding operations. Our cattle feeding operations have the capacity to support approximately 258,000 head of cattle and 9.6 million bushels of grain storage capacity.

Leoti, Kansas | May 2017 | 106 | 4,345 
Eckley, Colorado | May 2017 | 49 | 3,070 

  ﻿
 We purchase feeder cattle from producers, order buyers and livestock auctions, the majority of which are from Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Generally, our feeder cattle are purchased at weights between 650 and 950 pounds. We typically feed the feeder cattle for approximately 160 days prior to selling to large beef processors at prices determined by the market, adjusted for quality. Bulk cattle commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and the spreads between feeder and live cattle futures. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of cattle and cattle held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times.
 ﻿
 Vinegar operations. Fleischmann’s Vinegar is a liquid, natural specialty ingredients company serving a range of markets and end-use applications, including food and beverage flavoring ingredients, meat preservatives, antimicrobials, bio-herbicides, and cleaning products across the food, beverage, agricultural, industrial and consumer markets. Vinegar is sold primarily to major food industry participants, including leading branded food companies, private label food manufacturers and companies serving the foodservice channel. Our products appeal to both food and non-food end market applications and are comprised of white distilled vinegar and numerous specialty vinegars, including balsamic, red wine, white wine, cider and other varietals for retail and industrial uses. We have a dedicated research and development team, with extensive experience in food science and agriculture, that can develop innovative products and technology to meet the needs of customers for various specialized end-markets.
 ﻿
 Our vinegar operations include seven production facilities, which are located in Alabama, California, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri and New York, and three distribution warehouses, which are located in California, Oregon and Texas. All of our production facilities use food-grade ethanol as the primary production input.    ﻿
 Food-grade corn oil production. Our food-grade corn oil operations focus on shipping corn oil from facilities across the Midwest by rail or barge to terminal facilities located in the southern United States. Once the corn oil arrives at the terminal facility, it is unloaded and consolidated into set volumes and prepared for shipment by vessel. The corn oil is then shipped to independent refiners outside the United States for refining into a refined, bleached, dewaxed and deodorized food-grade product. This finished product is then shipped by vessel or container to our various customers. In addition, we also execute trade volumes of corn oil and soybean oil in both domestic and international markets.    ﻿
 Partnership Segment
 ﻿
 Our partnership segment provides fuel storage and transportation services through (i) 39 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 17 ethanol production plants, (ii) eight fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and (iii) a leased railcar fleet and other transportation assets.

﻿
 Transportation and Delivery. Most of our ethanol plants are situated near major highways or rail lines to ensure efficient movement. We are able to move product from our ethanol plants to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. We also manage the logistics and transportation requirements of our customers to improve our fleet’s efficiency and reduce operating costs. 
 ﻿
 Deliveries within 150 miles of our plants and the partnership’s fuel terminal facilities are generally transported by truck. Deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads, allowing our plants to ship product throughout the United States.
 ﻿
 To meet the challenge of marketing ethanol and distillers grains to diverse market segments, several of our plants are capable of simultaneously handling more than 150 railcars. Some of our locations have large loop tracks with unit train loading capabilities for both ethanol and dried distillers grains and spurs to connect the loop to the mainline or allow the movement and storage of railcars on site. 
 ﻿
 The partnership’s railcar fleet consists of approximately 3,500 leased tank cars for the transportation of ethanol. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years. 
 ﻿
 To optimize the partnership’s railcar assets, we transport products other than ethanol depending on market opportunities and have used a portion of our railcar fleet to transport crude oil for third parties and to lease railcars to other users.
 ﻿
 Terminal and Distribution Services. Ethanol is transported from the partnership’s terminals to third-party terminal racks where it is blended with gasoline and transferred to the loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. The partnership owns and operates fuel holding tanks and terminals, and provide terminal services and logistics solutions to markets that do not have efficient access to renewable fuels. The partnership operates fuel terminals at one owned and seven leased locations in seven states with combined storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg and throughput capacity of approximately 822 mmgy. We also have 39 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 17 ethanol production plants with a combined storage capacity of approximately 38.6 mmg to support current ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.5 bgy.

 ﻿
 Our Competition 
 ﻿
 Domestic Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We are the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol plants in the United States. We compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a relatively fragmented industry. Our competitors also include plants owned by farmers, oil refiners and retail fuel operators. These competitors may continue to operate their plants even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations.
 ﻿
 In 2017, the top five producers operated 89 plants and accounted for approximately 44% of the domestic production capacity with production capacities ranging from 800 mmgy to 1,700 mmgy. Approximately half of the 212 plants in the United States are standalone facilities and accounted for approximately 34% of domestic production capacity.
 ﻿
 Demand for corn from ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists in all areas and regions in which we operate. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there were 133 operational plants in the states where we have production facilities, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, as of January 23, 2018. The largest concentration of operational plants is located in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where 51% of all operational production capacity is located.
 ﻿
 Foreign Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We also compete globally with production from other countries. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States. Brazil produces ethanol made from sugarcane, which may be less expensive to produce than ethanol made from corn depending on feedstock prices. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. Any significant additional ethanol production capacity could create excess supply in world markets, resulting in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. 
 ﻿
 Other Competition
 ﻿
 Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Ethanol production technologies also continue to evolve. We expect changes to occur primarily in the area of cellulosic ethanol, which is made from biomass such as switch grass or fast-growing poplar trees. Since all of our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, adapting our plants for a different feedstock or process system would require additional capital investments and retooling which could be cost prohibitive.
 ﻿
 In addition, we compete with other cattle feeding operations and vinegar producers in competitive markets. Through our acquisition of Fleischmann’s Vinegar in 2016, we now operate one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food-grade industrial vinegar.  Additionally, following the acquisitions of the Hereford, Texas; Leoti, Kansas and Eckley, Colorado cattle-feeding operations, we now operate one of the largest cattle-feeding operations in the United States.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Matters
 ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or environment.
 ﻿
 RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 30, 2017, the EPA announced the final 2018 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target.
 ﻿

According to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2018 is the first year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels.  Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The reset will be triggered if the 2019 RVOs continue to be more than 20% below the statutory levels, and the EPA will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.
 ﻿
 Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. In November 2017, the EPA denied a petition to change the point of obligation under RFS II to the parties that own the gasoline before it is sold.

 ﻿
 Environmental and Other Regulation
 ﻿
 Our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, and food and ingredients segment activities are subject to environmental and other regulations. We obtain environmental permits to operate our plants and other facilities.
 ﻿
 Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 
 ﻿
 While some of our plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS II mandate, expansion above these capacities will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement. This may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve the EPA’s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program for our grandfathered plants, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. 
 ﻿
 CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS in November 2012, and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013.
 ﻿
 We employ maintenance and operations personnel at each of our plants. In addition to the attention we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations of our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

 ﻿
 BioProcess Algae Joint Venture 
 ﻿
 We are the majority owner of the BioProcess Algae joint venture, which was formed in 2008. The joint venture is focused on growing algae in commercially viable quantities using feedstocks that are created as part of our ethanol production process. The joint venture continues to take steps towards commercialization. We are currently focused on human and animal nutrition, using proprietary technology to customize specific products, based on proven benefits, for relevant markets.
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 On December 31, 2017, we had 1,427 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, including 198 employees at our corporate office in Omaha, Nebraska.
