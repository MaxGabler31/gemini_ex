(also referred to as “Successor,” “Amplify Energy,” or the “Company”), the intent is to refer to Amplify Energy, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole or on an individual basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made. Amplify Energy is the successor reporting company of Memorial Production Partners LP (“MEMP”) pursuant to Rule 15d-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). When referring to “Predecessor” or the “Company” in reference to the period prior to the emergence from bankruptcy, the intent is to refer to MEMP, the predecessor that was dissolved following the effective date of the Plan (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole or on an individual basis, depending on the context in which the statements are made.
Overview 
 Amplify Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploitation and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our management evaluates performance based on one reportable business segment, as the economic environments are not different within the operation of our oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are conducted through OLLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Our assets consist primarily of producing oil and natural gas properties located in the Rockies, federal waters offshore Southern California, East Texas / North Louisiana and South Texas. Most of our oil and natural gas properties are located in large, mature oil and natural gas reservoirs. The Company’s properties consist primarily of operated and non-operated working interests in producing and undeveloped leasehold acreage and working interests in identified producing wells. As of December 31, 2018: 

• | Our total estimated proved reserves were approximately 841.1 Bcfe, of which approximately 50% were oil and 79% were classified as proved developed reserves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We produced from 2,068 gross (1,125 net) producing wells across our properties, with an average working interest of 54% and the Company is the operator of record of the properties containing 92% of our total estimated proved reserves; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our average net production for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was 142.5 MMcfe/d, implying a reserve-to-production ratio of approximately 16 years.

 Amplify Energy was formed in March 2017 in connection with the reorganization of the Predecessor. The Predecessor was publicly traded from December 2011 to May 2017. As discussed further in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, on January 16, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), MEMP and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively with MEMP, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 proceedings”) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code” or “Chapter 11”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 proceedings were jointly administered under the caption In re Memorial Production Partners LP, et al. (Case No. 17-30262). On April 14, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) approving the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Memorial Production Partners LP and its affiliated Debtors, dated April 13, 2017 (as amended and supplemented, the “Plan”). On May 4, 2017, (the “Effective Date”), the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.

Our Areas of Operation 
 East Texas / North Louisiana 
 Approximately 45% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 65% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were located in the East Texas/ North Louisiana region. Our East Texas/ North Louisiana properties include wells and properties primarily located in the Joaquin, Carthage, Willow Springs and East Henderson fields in East Texas. Those properties collectively contained 379.1 Bcfe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 based on our reserve report and generated average net production of 92.8 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2018. 
 10

Rockies 
 Approximately 34% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 17% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were located in the Rockies region. Our Rockies properties include wells and properties primarily located in the Lost Soldier and Wertz fields in Wyoming at our Bairoil complex. Our Rockies properties contained 47.4 MMBbls of estimated net proved oil and NGLs reserves as of December 31, 2018 based on our reserve report and generated average net production of 24.8 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2018. 
 Based on our reserve report, the Lost Soldier and Wertz field both contain more than 15% of our total estimated reserves. The following table summarizes production volumes from these fields for the periods presented:

Average net production (MBbls/d) | | 4.2 | | 4.2 | | 4.2 | 4.2 

California 
 Approximately 18% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 13% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were located in federal waters offshore Southern California. These properties (the “Beta properties”) consist of: 100% of the working interests and currently an 75.2% average net revenue interest in three Pacific Outer Continental Shelf lease blocks (P-0300, P-0301 and P-0306), referred to as the Beta Unit, in the Beta Field located in federal waters approximately 11 miles offshore from the Port of Long Beach, California. Our Beta properties contained 24.8 MMBbls of estimated net proved oil reserves as of December 31, 2018 based on our reserve report. Oil and gas is produced from the Beta Unit via two production platforms, referred to as the Ellen and Eureka platforms, equipped with permanent drilling rigs and associated equipment systems. On a third platform, Elly, the oil, water and gas are separated and the oil is prepared for sale, while the gas is burned as fuel for power and the water is recycled back into the reservoir for pressure maintenance. Sales quality oil is then pumped from the Elly platform to the Beta pump station located onshore at the Port of Long Beach, California via a 16-inch diameter oil pipeline, which extends approximately 17.5 miles. Amplify Energy’s wholly owned subsidiary, San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company, owns and operates the pipeline system.
 Based on our reserve report, the Beta field contains more than 15% of our total estimated reserves. The following table summarizes production volumes from this field for the periods presented:
  
 | For the | | Period from | | Period from | For the 
---------------------------------+--------------+-------+-------------------+-------+-----------------+-------------
 | Year Ended | | May 5, 2017 | | January 1, 2017 | Year Ended

Production Volumes: | | | | | | | 
Oil (MBbls) | | 1,355 | | 1,022 | | 486 | 1,445
Average net production (MBbls/d) | | 3.7 | | 4.2 | | 3.9 | 3.9 

 Due to low oil and gas prices, the Beta leases were all granted royalty relief by the U.S. Department of Interior in July 2016. On our two primary producing leases, the royalty rate was reduced from 25% to 12.5%, and on our third lease, the royalty rate was reduced from 16.67% to 8.33%, for a weighted average of 12.4% overall. These royalty relief rates were to be suspended in months in which the trailing twelve-month weighted average NYMEX oil and Henry Hub gas price exceeds $55.16 per Boe which represented a 25% premium to the average realized price recognized by the Company during the qualification period. For the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2018, the twelve-month weighted average price exceeded the $55.16 threshold, which triggered the royalty rates on our leases to revert back to their pre-royalty relief levels effective as of May 31, 2018. The royalty relief will end in the event that the Company generates no benefit from the royalty relief rates for 12 consecutive months.

South Texas
 Approximately 3% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and approximately 5% of our average daily net production for the three months ended December 31, 2018 were located in the South Texas region. Our South Texas properties include wells and properties in fields located primarily in the Eagle Ford and Eagleville. Our South Texas properties contained 29.1 Bcfe of estimated net proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 based on our reserve report. Those properties collectively generated average net production of 6.4 MMcfe/d for the three months ended December 31, 2018. In May 2018, we closed a transaction to divest certain of our non-core assets located in South Texas (the “South Texas Divestiture”). Cash proceeds received from the South Texas Divestiture were approximately $17.1 million.
Our Oil and Natural Gas Data 
 Our Reserves 
 Internal Controls. Our proved reserves were estimated at the well or unit level and audited for reporting purposes by Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers. The Company maintains internal evaluations of our reserves in a secure reserve engineering database. Ryder Scott interacts with the Company’s internal petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals in each of our operating areas and with operating, accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for the reserves audit process. Reserves are reviewed and approved internally by our senior management on an annual basis and evaluated by our lender group on at least a semi-annual basis in connection with borrowing base redeterminations under our New Revolving Credit Facility. Our reserve estimates are audited by Ryder Scott at least annually.
Our internal professional staff works closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve audit process. All of the reserve information maintained in our secure reserve engineering database is provided to the external engineers.

The future cash flows are discounted using an annual discount rate of 10%. Standardized measure does not give effect to derivative transactions. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, see “Item 1. Business — Operations — Derivative Activities” as well as “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Derivative Contracts.”

(3) | Our estimated net proved reserves and related standardized measure were determined using 12-month trailing average oil and natural gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in effect as of the date of the estimate, without giving effect to derivative contracts, held constant throughout the life of the properties. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price received at the wellhead.

 The data in the table above represents estimates only. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. For a discussion of risks associated with internal reserve estimates, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.” 
 Future prices received for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by the SEC and FASB, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate. 
 Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 180.2 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves comprised of 15.5 MMBbls of oil, 61.8 Bcfe of natural gas and 4.2 MMBbls of NGLs. None of our PUDs as of December 31, 2018 are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as PUDs. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
 Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2018 were due to:
  
• | Downward performance and price revisions of 91 Bcfe;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Reclassifications of 18 Bcfe into proved developed reserves as wells are drilled, completed and turned to production; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13

 
• | Reserve additions of 7 Bcfe.
--+-----------------------------

 Approximately 6% (18 Bcfe) of our PUDs recorded as of December 31, 2017 were developed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Total costs incurred to develop these PUDs were approximately $27.1 million, of which $11.7 million was incurred in fiscal year 2017 and $15.3 million was incurred in fiscal year 2018. In total, we incurred total capital expenditures of approximately $17.6 million during fiscal year 2018 developing PUDs, which includes $2.3 million associated with PUDs to be completed in 2019. As we continue to develop our properties and have more well production and completion data, we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative drilling and completion costs as we convert PUDs into proved developed reserves in the upcoming years. Based on our current expectations of our cash flows, we believe that we can fund the drilling of our current PUD inventory and our expansions in the next five years from our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our New Revolving Credit Facility. For a more detailed discussion of our liquidity position, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Delivery Commitments 
 We have no commitments to deliver a fixed and determinable quantity of our oil or natural gas production in the near future under our existing sales contracts.
 16

We have entered into a long-term gas gathering agreement associated with a certain portion of our East Texas production with a third party midstream service provider that has volumetric requirements. Information regarding our delivery commitments under this contract is contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations” and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” both contained herein.
 Operations 
 General 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company is the operator of record of properties containing 92% of our total estimated proved reserves. We design and manage the development, recompletion and/or workover operations, and supervise other operation and maintenance activities, for all of the wells we operate. We do not own the drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on our onshore properties; independent contractors provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. Our Beta platforms have permanent drilling systems in place. 
Marketing and Major Customers 
 The following individual customers each accounted for 10% or more of our total reported revenues for the period indicated:

BP America Production Company | n/a | 10% | | 10% | n/a 
Royal Dutch Shell plc and subsidiaries | n/a | n/a | | n/a | 14% 

 The production sales agreements covering our properties contain customary terms and conditions for the oil and natural gas industry and provide for sales based on prevailing market prices. A majority of those agreements have terms that renew on a month-to-month basis until either party gives advance written notice of termination.
 If we were to lose any one of our customers, the loss could temporarily delay production and sale of a portion of our oil and natural gas in the related producing region. If we were to lose any single customer, we believe we could identify a substitute customer to purchase the impacted production volumes. However, if one or more of our larger customers ceased purchasing oil or natural gas altogether and we were unable to replace them, the loss of any such customer could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and revenues in general. 
 Title to Properties 
 We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often cursory investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. More thorough title investigations are customarily made before the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes, obligations or duties under applicable laws, development obligations under natural gas leases, or net profits interests.
Derivative Activities 
 We enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties, generally lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility or their affiliates, to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. We intend to enter into commodity derivative contracts at times and on terms desired to maintain a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts covering at least 25% - 50% of our estimated production from total proved developed producing reserves over a one-to-three year period at any given point of time to satisfy the hedging covenants in our New Revolving Credit Facility and pursuant to our internal policies. We may, however, from time to time, hedge more or less than this approximate amount.
 Periodically, we enter into interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure to market rate fluctuations by converting variable interest rates (such as those in our New Revolving Credit Facility) to fixed interest rates. 
 17

It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with creditworthy counterparties, which generally are financial institutions, deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. Some of the lenders, or certain of their affiliates, under our New Revolving Credit Facility are counterparties to our derivative contracts. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information. 
 Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, leasing acreage, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry and many of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than that available to us. 
Seasonal Nature of Business 
 The price we receive for our natural gas production is impacted by seasonal fluctuations in demand for natural gas. The demand for natural gas typically peaks during the coldest months and tapers off during the milder months, with a slight increase during the summer to meet the demands of electric generators. The weather during any particular season can affect this cyclical demand for natural gas. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers can lessen or intensify this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. 
Hydraulic Fracturing
 We use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of almost every well that we drill and complete, except in our offshore wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a necessary part of the completion process because our properties are dependent upon our ability to effectively fracture the producing formations in order to produce at economic rates. Our proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves make up 29% of the proved reserves with approximately 60% of these requiring hydraulic fracturing as of December 31, 2018. 
 We believe we have followed and continue to substantially follow applicable industry standard practices and legal and regulatory requirements for groundwater protection in our operations which are subject to supervision by state and federal regulators (including the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) on federal acreage). These protective measures include setting surface casing at a depth sufficient to protect fresh water zones as determined by regulatory agencies and cementing the well to create a permanent isolating barrier between the casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This aspect of well design is intended to essentially eliminate a pathway for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. For recompletions of existing wells, the production casing is pressure tested prior to perforating the new completion interval. 
 Injection rates and pressures are monitored instantaneously and in real time at the surface during our hydraulic fracturing operations. Pressure is monitored on both the injection string and the immediate annulus to the injection string. Hydraulic fracturing operations would be shut down immediately if an abnormal change occurred to the injection pressure or annular pressure. 
 Certain state regulations require disclosure of the components in the solutions used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Approximately 99% of the hydraulic fracturing fluids we use are made up of water and sand. The remainder of the constituents in the fracturing fluid are managed and used in accordance with applicable requirements. 
 Hydraulic fracture stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water. Upon flowback of the water, we dispose of it into approved disposal or injection wells. We currently do not discharge water to the surface. 
 For information regarding existing and proposed governmental regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters, see “— Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations — Hydraulic Fracturing.”
 Insurance 
 In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations and at costs that we believe to be economic. We regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance accordingly. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations, including the potential loss of significant revenues. We can provide no assurance that our coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. We currently have insurance policies that include the following:

• Commercial General Liability; | • Oil Pollution Act Liability; 
-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------
• Primary Umbrella / Excess Liability; | • Pollution Legal Liability; 
• Property; | • Charterer’s Legal Liability; 

 18

 
• Workers’ Compensation; | • Non-Owned Aircraft Liability; 
-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
• Employer’s Liability; | • Automobile Liability; 
• Maritime Employer’s Liability; | • Directors & Officers Liability; 
• U.S. Longshore and Harbor Workers’; | • Employment Practices Liability; 
• Energy Package/Control of Well; | • Crime; and 
• Loss of Production Income (offshore only); | • Fiduciary. 

 We continuously monitor regulatory changes and comments and consider their impact on the insurance market, along with and our overall risk profile. As necessary, we will adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection at a level we consider appropriate, while weighing the cost of insurance against the potential and magnitude of disruption to our operations and cash flows. Changes in laws and regulations could lead to changes in underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills.
 Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations 
 General 
 Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated drilling activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. 
 Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position. 
 BOEM & BSEE 
 Our oil and gas operations associated with our Beta properties are conducted on offshore leases in federal waters. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) have broad authority to regulate our oil and gas operations associated with our Beta properties. 
 BOEM is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of the nation’s offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies. Lessees must obtain BOEM approval for exploration, development and production plans prior to the commencement of offshore operations. In addition, approvals and permits are required from other agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, the EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation and the South Coast Air Quality Management District. BOEM generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth, post supplemental bonds or provide other acceptable assurances that the obligations will be met. In July 2016, BOEM issued updated guidance for determining if and when additional security is required for Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) leases, pipeline rights-of-way and rights-of-use and easement. The new criteria may require lessees or operators to take additional steps to demonstrate that they have the financial ability to carry out their obligations. In June 2017, BOEM announced that the implementation timeline would be extended, except in circumstances where there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s obligations.
 19

BSEE is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs. BSEE regulations require offshore production facilities and pipelines located on the OCS to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications, and BSEE has proposed and/or promulgated additional safety-related regulations concerning the design and operating procedures of these facilities and pipelines, including regulations to safeguard against or respond to well blowouts and other catastrophes. BSEE regulations also restrict the flaring or venting of natural gas, prohibit the flaring of liquid hydrocarbons and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all fixed drilling and production facilities. 
 BOEM and BSEE have adopted regulations providing for enforcement actions, including civil penalties and lease forfeiture or cancellation for failure to comply with regulatory requirements for offshore operations. If we fail to pay royalties or comply with safety and environmental regulations, BOEM and BSEE may require that our operations on the Beta properties be suspended or terminated and we may be subject to civil or criminal liability. 
 In January 2016, BOEM and BSEE entered into a settlement agreement with environmental groups promising to study the potential environmental impacts of well-stimulation practices on the Pacific OCS, including hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation. The study was completed in May 2016, finding no significant impact from these activities, and BSEE resumed its review of permit applications involving hydraulic fracturing operations or acid well stimulation on the Pacific OCS. However, in November 2018, a federal court prohibited BOEM and BSEE from approving any plans or issuing permits involving hydraulic fracturing and/or acid well stimulation on the Pacific OCS. Although we do not use either hydraulic fracturing or acid stimulation routinely in connection with our operations on the Beta properties, delays in the approval or refusal of plans and issuance of permits by BOEM or BSEE because of staffing, economic, environmental, legal or other reasons (or other actions taken by BOEM or BSEE) could adversely affect our offshore operations. The requirements imposed by BOEM and BSEE regulations are frequently changed and subject to new interpretations.
 Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also referred to as the Superfund law and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons deemed “responsible parties.” These persons include current owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release or disposal of hazardous substances and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law-based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Also, comparable state statutes may not contain a similar exemption for petroleum. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. 
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on “responsible parties” for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters and natural resource damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities, but these liability limits may not apply if: a spill is caused by a party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; or a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. We are also subject to analogous state statutes that impose liabilities with respect to oil spills. For example, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response have adopted oil-spill prevention regulations that overlap with federal regulations.
 20

We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. Although RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes stringent requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, could be designated as “hazardous wastes” in the future and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Also, in December 2016, the EPA entered into a consent decree requiring it to review its regulation of oil and gas waste. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019, for revision of certain regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes revised oil and gas regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
 It is possible that our oil and natural gas operations may require us to manage naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”). NORM is present in varying concentrations in sub-surface formations, including hydrocarbon reservoirs, and may become concentrated in scale, film and sludge in equipment that comes in contact with crude oil and natural gas production and processing streams. Some states have enacted regulations governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM. 
 Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, OPA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 
 Water Discharges and Other Waste Discharges & Spills
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act), the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the OPA and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including oil and hazardous substances, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. These laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”). In June 2015, the EPA and the Corps issued a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) for all Clean Water Act programs. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the rule revising the WOTUS definition nationwide pending further action of the court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” However, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must first be reviewed in the federal district courts, which resulted in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. In addition, the EPA has proposed to repeal the rule revising the WOTUS definition, and in January 2018, the EPA released a final rule that delays implementation of the rule revising the WOTUS definition until 2020 to allow time for the EPA to reconsider the definition of the term “waters of the United States.” Subsequent litigation in the federal district courts has resulted in patchwork application of the rule in some states, but not others. In December 2018, the EPA released revisions to the definition of WOTUS that would provide discrete categories of jurisdictional waters and tests for determining whether a particular waterbody meets any of those classifications. Several groups have already announced their intentions to challenge the proposed rule. To the extent the rule is enforced in jurisdictions in which we operate or a replacement rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 
 The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development and require us to incur compliance costs. 
 21

These laws and any implementing regulations provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans, in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 
 In addition, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of waste has been alleged to cause earthquakes. For example, in February 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. In some jurisdictions, such issues have led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity or resulted in stricter regulatory requirements relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “Commission”) requires applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey, which are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The Commission is authorized to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Commission is also considering new restrictions that could limit the volume and pressure of produced water injected into disposal wells. Any future orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection in jurisdictions where we operate could affect or curtail our operations.
 Hydraulic Fracturing 
 We use hydraulic fracturing extensively in our onshore operations, but not our offshore operations. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from low permeability subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. While hydraulic fracturing has historically been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation. For example, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the SDWA involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. In addition, in May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and natural gas exploration or production. Also, in June 2016, the EPA finalized wastewater pretreatment standards that prohibit onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities from sending wastewater to publicly-owned treatment works; for certain facilities, compliance is required by August 2019. This pending restriction of disposal options for hydraulic fracturing waste and other changes to environmental requirements may result in increased costs. The EPA is also conducting a study of onshore conventional and unconventional oil and gas extraction wastewater management, and previously conducted a study of private wastewater treatment facilities, also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities, accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. 
 In addition, in March 2015, the BLM published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule required public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures and the depths of all usable water. Following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. However, several environmental groups and states have challenged the BLM’s rescission of the rule in ongoing litigation. 
 Several states have also adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations requiring the disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and/or otherwise impose additional requirements for hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources has adopted rules requiring the public disclosure of the composition and volume of fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations. Also, Texas requires oil and natural gas operators to disclose to the Railroad Commission of Texas and the public the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the total volume of water used. Texas has also imposed requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells, and testing and reporting requirements. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 22

Certain governmental reviews have been conducted that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, which could lead to increased regulation. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. In addition, as discussed above, BOEM and BSEE completed a study in May 2016 regarding the potential environmental impacts of well-stimulation practices on the Pacific OCS. These studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 
 A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. In the event state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. 
 In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. For example, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing, and any of the above risks could impair our ability to manage our business and have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows and financial position.
 Air Emissions 
 The federal Clean Air Act, as amended (“CAA”), and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including compressor stations, through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. 
 The New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs under the CAA impose specific requirements affecting the oil and gas industry for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants, completions and certain other equipment. Periodic review and revision of these rules by federal and state agencies may require changes to our operations, including possible installation of new equipment to control emissions. We continuously evaluate the effect of new rules on our business. For example, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules to reduce methane and volatile organic compounds (“VOC”) emissions for certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment, processes and activities across the oil and natural gas sector; however, in September 2018, under a new administration, the EPA proposed amendments that would relax requirements of the rules. Similarly, in September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of regulations it previously enacted to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands; the revised new rule has been challenged in ongoing litigation. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending. In May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements and cause major delays in construction, effectively depressing new development. The EPA also lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay and increased expenditures for air pollution control equipment or delay, or limit our ability to obtain permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business. 
 23

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (“SCAQMD”) is a regulatory subdivision of the State of California and responsible for air pollution control from stationary sources within Orange County and designated portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. Our Beta properties and associated facilities are subject to regulation by the SCAQMD.
 We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits addressing air emission related issues, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development, which costs could be significant. We believe that we currently are in substantial compliance with all air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our current operations. 
 Regulation of “Greenhouse Gas” Emissions
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, the EPA, as well as the BLM, have issued rules to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail above under the caption “Air Emissions.” Several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources within the oil and natural gas source category. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which include certain of our operations. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Such climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. In addition, on an international level, the United States was one of 175 countries to sign an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that requires member countries to set their own GHG emission reduction goals beginning in 2020. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which withdrawal would not take place until November 2019. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Various states and local governments have vowed to continue to enact regulations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
 Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Any GHG regulation could increase our costs of compliance by potentially delaying the receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals; requiring us to monitor emissions, install additional equipment or modify facilities to reduce GHG and other emissions; purchase emission credits; and utilize electric driven compression at facilities to obtain regulatory permits and approvals in a timely manner. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. 
 In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Moreover, any legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could also reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Finally, it should be noted that most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our development and production operations. 
 24

National Environmental Policy Act 
 Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the U.S. Departments of Interior and Agriculture, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency prepares an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. If impacts are considered significant, the agency will prepare a more detailed environmental impact study that is made available for public review and comment. All of our current development and production activities, as well as proposed development plans, on federal lands, including those in the Pacific Ocean, require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This environmental impact assessment process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.
Endangered Species Act 
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state statutes restrict activities that may adversely affect endangered and threatened species or their habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species in areas where we operate could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we currently, or could in the future, undertake operations. The presence of protected species in areas where we operate could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those operations, lose leaseholds as we may not be permitted to timely commence drilling operations, cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Occupational Safety and Health Act 
 We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. For example, under a new OSHA standard limiting respirable silica exposure, the oil and gas industry must implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 2021. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on our assets. Additionally, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 
 Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress, and the development of regulations continues in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including oil and natural gas facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
 Drilling and Production 
 Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following: 

• | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells;
--+--------------------------------------


• | transportation of materials and equipment to and from our well sites and facilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transportation and disposal of produced fluids and natural gas; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | notice to surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 25

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. 
 Sale and Transportation of Gas and Oil 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) approves the construction of interstate gas pipelines and the rates and service conditions for the interstate transportation of gas, oil and other liquids by pipeline. Although the FERC does not regulate the production of gas, the FERC exercises regulatory authority over wholesale sales of gas in interstate commerce through the issuance of blanket marketing certificates that authorize the wholesale sale of gas at market rates and the imposition of a code of conduct on blanket marketing certificate holders that regulate certain affiliate interactions. The FERC does not regulate the sale of oil or petroleum products or the construction of oil or other liquids pipelines. The FERC also has oversight of the performance of wholesale natural gas markets, including the authority to facilitate price transparency and to prevent market manipulation. In furtherance of this authority, the FERC imposed an annual reporting requirement on all industry participants, including otherwise non-jurisdictional entities, engaged in wholesale physical natural gas sales and purchases in excess of a minimum level. The agency’s actions are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry. To date, the FERC’s pro-competition policies have not materially affected our business or operations. It is unclear what impact, if any, future rules or increased competition within the gas industry will have on our gas sales efforts. 
 The FERC and other federal agencies, the U.S. Congress or state legislative bodies and regulatory agencies may consider additional proposals or proceedings that might affect the gas or oil industries. We cannot predict when or if these proposals will become effective or any effect they may have on our operations. We do not believe, however, that any of these proposals will affect us any differently than other gas producers with which we compete. 
 The Beta properties include the San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company, which owns and operates an offshore crude pipeline. This pipeline is subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”) and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Tariff rates for liquids pipelines, which include both crude oil pipelines and refined products pipelines, must be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory. FERC regulations require that interstate oil pipeline transportation rates and terms of service be filed with the FERC and posted publicly. The FERC has established a formulaic methodology for petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index. The FERC reviews the formula every five years. Effective July 1, 2016, the current index for the five-year period ending July 2021 is the producer price index for finished goods plus an adjustment factor of 1.23 percent. The San Pedro Bay Pipeline Company uses the indexing methodology to change its rates. 
 The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service. BOEM/BSEE has established formal and informal complaint procedures for shippers that believe that have been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to transportation on the OCS. 
 The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) regulates all pipeline transportation in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, including pipeline facilities on the OCS. The San Pedro Bay pipeline is subject to regulation by the PHMSA. The PHMSA has also proposed additional regulations for gas pipeline safety. For example, in March 2016, the PHMSA proposed a rule that, if adopted, would expand integrity management requirements beyond high consequence areas (“HCAs”), which are areas where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high-population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas, to apply to gas pipelines in newly defined “moderate consequence areas” that contain as few as five dwellings within the potential impact area. Many gas pipelines that were in place before 1970, and thus grandfathered from certain pressure testing obligations, would be required to be pressure tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures. Many gathering lines in rural areas that are currently not regulated at the federal level would also be covered by this proposal. More recently, in January 2017, the PHMSA finalized new regulations for hazardous liquid pipelines that significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (i.e., periodic assessments, repairs and leak detection), regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to an HCA. The final rule also requires all pipelines in or affecting an HCA to be capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools within the next 20 years. In addition, the final rule extends annual and accident reporting requirements to gravity lines and all gathering lines and also imposes inspection requirements on pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, landslides, floods, earthquakes, or other similar events that are likely to damage infrastructure. The timing for implementation of this rule is uncertain at this time due to the change in presidential administrations.
 26

Moreover, effective April 2017, the PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations to up to $209,002 per violation per day and up to $2,090,022 for a related series of violations. The PHMSA has also issued a final rule applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by some of its safety regulation. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more stringent safety controls or result in more stringent enforcement of applicable legal requirements could subject us to increased capital costs, operational delays and costs of operation.
 Anti-Market Manipulation Laws and Regulations 
 The FERC with respect to the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transmission or transportation services subject to FERC jurisdiction and the Federal Trade Commission with respect to petroleum and petroleum products, operating under various statutes have each adopted anti-market manipulation regulations, which prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the respective markets. These agencies hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties, to order repayment or disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties. Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 
 Derivatives Regulation
 Comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the President on July 21, 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”.) The legislation called for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to regulate certain markets for derivative products, including over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives. The CFTC has issued several new relevant regulations and other rulemakings are pending at the CFTC, the product of which would are rules that implement the mandates in the new legislation to cause significant portions of derivatives markets to clear through clearinghouses. While some of these rules have been finalized, some have not and, as a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain. 
 In particular, on October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted final rules under the establishing position limits for certain energy commodity futures and options contracts and economically equivalent swaps, futures and options. The position limit levels set the maximum amount of covered contracts that a trader may own or control separately or in combination, net long or short. The final rules also contained limited exemptions from position limits which would be phased in over time for certain bona fide hedging transactions and positions. The CFTC’s original position limits rule was challenged in court by two industry associations and was vacated and remanded by a federal district court. However, the CFTC proposed and revised new rules in November 2013 and December 2016, respectively, that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC has sought comment on the position limits rule as reproposed, but these new position limit rules are not yet final and the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time. The CFTC has withdrawn its appeal of the court order vacating the original position limits rule. 
 The legislation and new regulations may also require counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions at current levels or at all. Our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations. Our use of derivative financial instruments does not eliminate our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates and has in the past and could in the future result in financial losses or reduce our income.
 Our sales of oil and natural gas are also subject to anti-manipulation and anti-disruptive practices authority under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder by the CFTC. The CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits any person from using or employing any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity, or for future delivery on such commodity, in contravention of the CFTC’s rules and regulations.

State Regulation 
 Various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, the baseline Texas severance tax on oil and gas is 4.6% of the market value of oil produced and 7.5% of the market value of gas produced and saved. A number of exemptions from or reductions of the severance tax on oil and gas production is provided by the State of Texas which effectively lowers the cost of production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. 
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
