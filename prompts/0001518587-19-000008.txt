Company History
Our predecessor was formed at the end of 2004 through the merger of Commonwealth Industries, Inc. and IMCO Recycling, Inc. The predecessor’s business grew through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, the most significant of which was the 2006 acquisition of the downstream aluminum business of Corus Group plc (“Corus Aluminum”). The Corus Aluminum acquisition doubled our predecessor’s size and significantly expanded both its presence in Europe and its ability to manufacture higher value-added products, including aerospace and autobody sheet (“ABS”). 
The predecessor was acquired by Texas Pacific Group (“TPG”) in December 2006 and taken private. In 2007, it sold its zinc business in order to focus on its core aluminum business. In 2009, the predecessor, along with certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The bankruptcy filings were the result of a liquidity crisis brought on by the global recession and financial crisis. The predecessor’s ability to respond to the liquidity crisis was constrained by its highly leveraged capital structure, which at filing included $2.7 billion of debt, resulting from the 2006 leveraged buyout of the predecessor by TPG. As a result of the severe economic decline, the predecessor experienced sudden and significant value reductions across each end-use industry it served and a precipitous decline in the London Metal Exchange (“LME”) price of aluminum. These factors reduced the availability of financing under the predecessor’s revolving credit facility and required the posting of cash collateral on aluminum hedges. The predecessor sought bankruptcy protection to alleviate its liquidity constraints and restructure its operations and financial position.
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2009 to acquire the assets and operations of the predecessor upon emergence from bankruptcy, which occurred on June 1, 2010. TPG exited our business during this time and we received significant support from new equity investors, led by the Oaktree Funds, the majority owner of Aleris Corporation, as well as certain investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (“Apollo”) and Bain Capital Credit, LP (“Bain Capital Credit” and, together with the Oaktree Funds and Apollo, the “Investors”). 
Since 2010, the Company has grown through the successful combination of strategic growth initiatives involving acquisitions, such as the 2014 acquisition of Nichols Aluminum LLC (“Nichols”), and investments in our existing facilities and in China. These initiatives were targeted at broadening our product offerings and geographic presence, diversifying our end-use customer base, increasing our scale and scope, and offering a higher value-added product mix. In 2015, we sold our recycling and specification alloys and extrusions businesses in order to focus on our aluminum rolled products business. 
Business Segments
We report three operating segments based on the organizational structure that we use to evaluate performance, make decisions on resource allocations and perform business reviews of financial results. The Company’s operating segments (each of which is considered a reportable segment) are North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.
In addition to these reportable segments, we disclose corporate and other unallocated amounts, including start-up costs. 
See Note 16, “Segment and Geographic Information,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for financial and geographic information about our segments.

The following charts present the percentage of our consolidated revenue by reportable segment and by end-use for the year ended December 31, 2018:
North America 
Our North America segment consists of nine manufacturing facilities located throughout the United States that produce rolled aluminum and coated products for the building and construction, automotive, truck trailer, consumer durables and other general industrial and distribution end-uses. Substantially all of our North America segment’s products are manufactured to specific customer requirements, using continuous cast and direct-chill technologies that provide us with significant flexibility to produce a wide range of products. Specifically, those products are integrated into, among other applications, building products, automobiles, truck trailers, appliances and recreational vehicles. 
We are continuing to implement our previously announced project to add ABS capabilities at our aluminum rolling mill in Lewisport, Kentucky (the “North America ABS Project”). We have invested approximately $425.0 million to build a new wide cold mill, two continuous annealing lines with pre-treatment (each, a “CALP”) and an automotive innovation center. We have also invested in upgrades to other key non-ABS equipment at this facility, including upgrading our ingot scalper and pre-heating furnaces and widening the hot mill, to capture additional opportunities. The Lewisport facility has been shipping ABS and wide non-ABS to customers using the re-engineered hot mill, the new wide cold mill and the first of the two CALPs since the fourth quarter of 2017. We have completed the construction and installation and are substantially through commissioning of the facility’s second CALP, which is now producing commercial shipments. We believe the investments position us to meet significant growth in demand for ABS in North America as the automotive industry pursues broader aluminum use for the production of lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
In connection with the North America ABS Project, the segment has been incurring costs associated with start-up activities, including the design and development of new products and processes, the manufacture of commissioning and qualification products, and the development of sales and marketing efforts necessary to enter this new end-use. These start-up costs have historically been excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment income. The North America ABS Project substantially exited the start-up phase for the first CALP during the third quarter of 2018. Beginning in the third quarter of 2018, the majority of the costs previously classified as start-up costs were included in segment Adjusted EBITDA and segment income. Start-up costs associated with the second CALP continue to be excluded from these performance metrics. 
We have the largest footprint of continuous cast operations of any aluminum rolled products producer in North America. Our continuous cast operations have lower capital requirements and lower operating costs compared to our direct-chill cast operations. 
For our continuous cast operations, scrap input typically comprises over 90% of our overall metal needs, which provides substantial benefits, including metal cost savings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 99% of our North America revenues were derived using a formula pricing model which allows us to pass through risks from the volatility of aluminum price changes by charging a market-based aluminum price plus a conversion fee.

Europe
Our Europe segment consists of two world-class aluminum rolling mills, one in Koblenz, Germany and the other in Duffel, Belgium, and an aluminum cast house in Voerde, Germany. The segment produces aerospace plate and sheet, ABS, clad brazing sheet (clad aluminum material used for, among other applications, vehicle radiators and HVAC systems), heat-treated plate for engineered product applications and industrial coil and sheets. Substantially all of our Europe segment’s products are manufactured to specific customer requirements using direct-chill cast technologies that allow us to use and offer a variety of alloys and products for a number of technically demanding end-uses, which command some of the highest margins in the industry.
For over a decade, we have been a leading supplier of automotive and aerospace aluminum rolled products in Europe. We believe the technical and quality requirements needed to participate in these end-uses provides us with a competitive advantage. In 2018 we qualified and started production of wingskin products, a product for commercial aircraft wings to be used in the aerospace industry, in Koblenz.

Asia Pacific
Our Asia Pacific segment consists of a rolling mill in Zhenjiang, Peoples Republic of China (PRC) that produces technically demanding and value-added plate products for aerospace, semiconductor equipment, general engineering, distribution and other end-uses worldwide. Substantially all of our Asia Pacific segment’s products are manufactured to specific customer requirements using direct-chill cast technologies that allow us to use and offer a variety of alloys and products principally for aerospace and also for a number of other technically demanding end-uses.
The Zhenjiang rolling mill commenced operations in the first quarter of 2013 and achieved Nadcap certification, an industry standard for the production of aerospace aluminum, in 2014. Since then, the Zhenjiang rolling mill has received qualifications from several industry-leading aircraft manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and COMAC, and is the only facility in Asia capable of meeting the exacting standards of the global aerospace industry.
We expect demand for aluminum plate in Asia to grow, driven by the development and expansion of industries serving aerospace, semiconductor, rail and other technically demanding applications. In anticipation of this demand, we built the Zhenjiang rolling mill with 250,000 tons of hot mill capacity and the capability to both expand into other high growth and high value-added products, including ABS, clad brazing sheet and other technically demanding products, as well as produce additional aerospace and heat treated plate with modest incremental investment. Currently, we are expanding our aerospace offerings by investing in machining equipment, and are introducing advanced alloys to allow for the production of pre-machined plates for commercial aircraft wings to be used in the aerospace industry, commercial shipments of which are expected to begin in the second half of 2019.

Industry Overview
Aluminum is a widely-used, attractive industrial material. Compared to several alternative metals such as steel and copper, aluminum is lightweight, has a high strength-to-weight ratio and is resistant to corrosion. Aluminum can be recycled repeatedly without any material decline in performance or quality. The recycling of aluminum delivers energy and capital investment savings relative to both the cost of producing primary aluminum and many other competing materials. The penetration of aluminum into a wide variety of applications continues to grow. We believe several factors support fundamental long-term growth in aluminum consumption in the end-uses we serve. 
The global aluminum industry consists of primary aluminum producers with bauxite mining, alumina refining and aluminum smelting capabilities; aluminum semi-fabricated products manufacturers, including aluminum casters, recyclers, extruders and flat rolled products producers; and integrated companies that are present across multiple stages of the aluminum production chain. The industry is cyclical and is affected by global economic conditions, industry competition and product development.
Primary aluminum prices are determined by worldwide forces of supply and demand and, as a result, are volatile. This volatility has a significant impact on the profitability of primary aluminum producers whose selling prices are typically based upon prevailing LME prices while their costs to manufacture are not highly correlated to LME prices. We participate in select segments of the aluminum fabricated products industry, focusing on aluminum rolled products. We do not smelt aluminum, nor do we participate in other upstream activities, including mining bauxite or refining alumina. Since the majority of our products are sold on a market-based aluminum price plus conversion fee basis, we are less exposed to aluminum price volatility.
Sales and Marketing 
We sell our products to end-users and distributors, principally for use in the aerospace, automotive, building and construction, truck trailer, consumer durables, other general industrial and distribution industries. Backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $88.1 million and $114.3 million, respectively, for North America, $251.2 million and $244.5 million, respectively, for Europe, and $86.0 million and $39.1 million, respectively, for Asia Pacific.
Sales of products are made through each segment’s own sales force, which are strategically located to provide international coverage, and through a broad network of sales offices and agents in North America and major European countries, as well as in Asia and Australia. The majority of our customer sales agreements in our segments are for a term of one year or less. 
8

Competition 
The worldwide aluminum industry is highly competitive. Aluminum also competes with other materials such as steel, plastic, composite materials and glass for various applications. 
We compete in the production and sale of rolled aluminum sheet and plate. In the sectors in which we compete, other industry leaders include Arconic, Constellium, Novelis, Kaiser, Hydro, JW Aluminum and Jupiter Aluminum. We compete with other rolled products suppliers on the basis of quality, price, timeliness of delivery and customer service. 
Raw Materials and Supplies 
A significant portion of the aluminum metal used by our North America segment is purchased aluminum scrap that is acquired from aluminum scrap dealers or brokers. We believe that this segment is one of the largest users of aluminum scrap (other than beverage can scrap) in North America. The remaining requirements of this segment are met with purchased primary metal and rolling slab, including metal produced in the U.S. and internationally. 
Our Europe segment relies on a number of European smelters for primary aluminum and rolling slab. Due to a shortage of internal slab casting capacity, we contract with smelters and other third parties to provide slab that meets our specifications.
Our Asia Pacific segment relies primarily on domestic smelters for primary aluminum. A portion of the raw material used by this segment is imported in order to meet quality requirements.
We believe that the raw materials necessary to our business are and will continue to be available. In an effort to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations, we use a formula pricing model which allows us to pass through risks from the volatility of aluminum price changes by charging a market-based aluminum price plus a conversion fee for the substantial majority of our contracts, and we strive to manage the remaining key commodity risks through our hedging programs. 
Energy Supplies 
Our operations are fueled by natural gas and electricity, which represent the third largest component of our cost of sales, after metal and labor costs. We purchase the majority of our natural gas and electricity on a spot-market basis. However, in an effort to acquire the most favorable energy costs, we have secured some of our natural gas and electricity at fixed price commitments. We use forward contracts and options, as well as contractual price escalators, to reduce the risks associated with our natural gas requirements.
Research and Development 
Our research and development organization includes three centers in Europe, one in North America and one in Asia, with a support staff focused on new product and alloy offerings and process performance technology. Research and development expenses were $18.4 million, $16.0 million and $10.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We hold patents registered in the United States and other countries relating to our business. In addition to patents, we also possess other intellectual property, including trademarks, tradenames, know-how, developed technology and trade secrets. Although we believe these intellectual property rights are important to the operations of our specific businesses, we do not consider any single patent, trademark, tradename, know-how, developed technology, trade secret or any group of patents, trademarks, tradenames, know-how, developed technology or trade secrets to be material to our business as a whole.
Seasonality 
Certain of our products are seasonal. Demand in the rolled products business is generally stronger in the spring and summer seasons due to higher demand in the building and construction industry. This typically results in higher operating income in our second and third quarters, followed by our first and fourth quarters.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of approximately 5,500 employees, which included approximately 1,900 employees engaged in administrative and supervisory activities and approximately 3,600 employees engaged in manufacturing, production and maintenance functions. In addition, collectively, approximately 64% of our U.S. employees and substantially all of our non-U.S. employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our labor relations with employees have been satisfactory. 
9

Environmental 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the investigation or remediation of contaminated sites and employee health and safety. These laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon statutorily defined parties, including us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. Given the changing nature of environmental, health and safety legal requirements, we may be required, from time to time, to incur substantial costs in order to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. For example, we may be required to install additional pollution control equipment, make process changes, or take other environmental control measures at some of our facilities to meet future requirements.
We have been named as a potentially responsible party in certain proceedings initiated pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“Superfund”) and similar state statutes and may be named a potentially responsible party in other similar proceedings in the future. We are performing operations and maintenance at two Superfund sites for matters arising out of past waste disposal activity associated with closed facilities. We are also under orders to perform environmental remediation by agencies in four states and one non-U.S. country at seven sites. It is not anticipated that the costs incurred in connection with the presently pending proceedings will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Currently, and from time to time, we are a party to notices of violation brought by governmental agencies concerning the laws governing environmental, health and safety matters, such as air emissions. 
Our aggregate accrual for environmental matters was $25.6 million and $22.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of these amounts, approximately $11.9 million and $10.2 million are indemnified at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although the outcome of any such matters, to the extent they exceed any applicable accrual, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the applicable period, we currently believe that any such outcome would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
In addition, we have asset retirement obligations of $6.8 million and $6.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for costs related to the future removal of asbestos and costs to remove underground storage tanks. The related asset retirement costs are capitalized as long-lived assets (asset retirement cost), and are being amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” and Note 9, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 
The processing of scrap generates solid waste in the form of salt cake and baghouse dust. This material is disposed of at off-site landfills. If salt cake was ever classified as a hazardous waste in the U.S., the costs to manage and dispose of it would increase, which could result in significant increased expenditures.
