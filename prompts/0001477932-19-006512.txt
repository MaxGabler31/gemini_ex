THC Therapeutics, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is collectively referred to herein as the “Company,” and “THC Therapeutics.”

The Company is focused on developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator®, which has been specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. 

Corporate History

THC Therapeutics, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 1, 2007, as Fairytale Ventures, Inc., as a development stage company with plans to provide products and services related to themed children’s parties, and later changed its name to Aviation Surveillance Systems, Inc., when the Company shifted its business plan to focus on merging with an operating firm, and Harmonic Energy, Inc., when the Company shifted its plan of operations again, instead focusing on oil and gas operations. 

On January 23, 2017, the Company experienced a change of control, and new management determined to shift the Company’s focus and changed the Company’s name to THC Therapeutics, Inc., focusing on wellness operations and development of a herb dryer for use with cannabis. On May 30, 2017, the Company formed Genesis Float Spa LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to market its float spa assets purchased for wellness centers. On January 17, 2018, the Company changed its name to Millennium BlockChain Inc. and began to also focus on acquiring digital equity or digital assets of blockchain technology companies. On September 28, 2018, because of the regulatory environment surrounding blockchain technology companies, the Company changed its name back to THC Therapeutics, Inc., abandoned its blockchain technology focus, and refocused its efforts on its wellness operations. 

The Company’s fiscal year end is July 31st, its telephone number is (702) 602-8422, and the address of its principal executive office is 645 Front St., #2202, San Diego, California, 92101.

Description of Business

The Company is focused on operations in the wellness industry. The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator®, with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator® can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15% in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. Additionally, after the Company has launched the dHydronator®, and depending on available funding, the Company intends to establish a float spa facility that will allow each guest to customize their wellness experience, at their own pace, based on their individual needs. 

Effective November 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with ADVFN plc of the United Kingdom (“ADVFN”) to create a joint venture entity, MJAC InvestorsHub International Conferences Limited, to be owned 50/50 by the Company and ADVFN. Effective April 1, 2018, we and ADVFN terminated the joint venture agreement.

Previously, the Company had also been focused on seeking partnerships and investments in the blockchain technology industry, and making strategic investments in the equity of target companies and their tokens. In September of 2018, the Company assessed the current regulatory environment regarding cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, as well as the progress of the Company’s 20 separate patent claims for the Company’s sanitizing herb dryer, and the Company determined that it would refocus its efforts on developing the Company’s dHydronator sanitizing herb dryer. 

Wellness Operations

THC Therapeutics is focused on the wellness industry, with plans to develop a patented herb dryer as well as an innovative float spa facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, or southern California. 

The Company is developing a sanitizing herb dryer, the dHydronator®, with multiple design, function, and usage patents. This innovative, laboratory-proven1 product is specifically designed for the drying and sanitizing (i.e., reducing the bacterial count by using ultraviolet light) of freshly harvested cannabis, and other herbs, flowers, and tea leaves. The dHydronator® can reduce moisture content of cannabis to 10-15% in only 10-14 hours. Traditional herbal drying times can take up to two weeks. The dHydronator® can also significantly reduce the bacterial count of the cannabis during the drying process, but it will not eliminate all bacteria from the cannabis or other plant materials.

The Company has a functioning prototype of the dHydronator® similar in design to that shown below, which is now protected by a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (see “Patent, Trademark, License & Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions” below), and once the Company has sufficient funds available, the Company plans to source parts for serial manufacturing and negotiate and secure serial manufacturing and assembly. The Company also plans to hire sales and marketing staff as funds are available.

               ________________
1 Tests were conducted in 2016-2017 by independent cannabis-testing labs: first by CannLabs on the first-generation dHydronator® prototype, and later by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype. Optimal cannabis moisture content is 8-12%. The initial testing by CannLabs showed that (i) moisture content across five wet cannabis samples was reduced to an average moisture content of 13.81% with a standard deviation of 4.04% after 12 hours of drying, and 8.86% with a standard deviation of 2.25% after 16 hours of drying, and (ii) after autoclaving cannabis flowers to ensure sterility and then spiking multiple samples with 100 CFU of E. Coli and Salmonella bacteria and Aspergillus niger mold, testing for the presence of the bacteria and mold by both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and traditional plating methods, which testing concluded that the dHydronator® prototype eliminated or reduced the bacteria and mold contamination, but did not quantify the results. The subsequent testing by Digipath Labs on the second-generation prototype covered multiple strains and independent tests to confirm the prior findings. The strains tested were Lucy Diamond, Cotton Candy, Blue Dream, Kings Cut, Pot of Gold and Diablo. The optimal drying time was determined to be 10-14 hours in the first test. The Company’s proprietary sanitizing technology brought the failing TAC (total aerobic count) from over 300,000 CFU/g down to 78,000 CFU/g (anything less than 100,000 CFU/g is considered “passing”) in the second test. In the third test, after drying 14 hours and 15.5 hours in the dHydronator® and using the Company’s proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had been reduced from 80% (at 0 hours) to 10.89% (at 14 hours) and 8.83% (at 15.5 hours), the THCA% had been reduced from 21.2% (at 0 hours) to 17.26% (at 14 hours) and 18.26% (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 210,000 CFU/g (at 0 hours) to 1,500 CFU/g (at 14 hours) and 500 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). In the fourth experiment, after 12 hours and 15.5 hours of drying in the dHydronator® and using the proprietary sanitizing technology for a longer period than required, the moisture content had reduced from 80% to 12.00% (at 12 hours) and 7.44% (at 15.5 hours), the THCA% had been reduced from 21.2% to 20.08% (at 12 hours) and 19.43% (at 15.5 hours), and the TAC had been reduced from 190,000 CFU/g to 51,000 CFU/g (at 12 hours) and 2,300 CFU/g (at 15.5 hours). After 14 hours of drying, the moisture content had been reduced to 8.15%, the THCA% had been reduced to 19.82%, and the TAC had been reduced to 21,000 CFU/g. In the fifth test, prior moisture and THCA% results were tested, but this time using the Company’s proprietary sanitizing technology for a much shorter time period, using two samples of a different cannabis strain, and testing the expanded cannabinoid profile data of each sample, and after 12 hours of drying two different samples, moisture content for the two samples decreased from 74% and 74% to 9.17% and 9.90%, respectively, and THCA% increased from 14.45% and 14.94% before drying to 16.81% and 17.2%, respectively, after 12 hours of drying. Test six was a test of the same strain as test five but using a different lot of plant material, and moisture content decreased from 81% to 11.5% after 12 hours of drying, while TCHA% increased from 21.28% to 22.6% after 12 hours of drying. The seventh through ninth tests confirmed prior results.

More specifically, once we have at least $2,000,000 in in available cash flow or funds from other operations and if we receive the patent, we intend to engage in further development efforts as follows: (i) finalizing case design, with an estimated tooling expense of approximately $300,000-$500,000; manufacturing pre-production units for field testing and presentation to potential partners and distributors, with an estimated expense of $250,000; (iii) hiring a subject-matter expert and consultants or employees in the home herb garden and legal cannabis marketplace to manage the development and sales of herb dryer, with an estimated expense of $400,000 for 12 months; (iv) engaging in further detailed laboratory of our herb drying with respect to cannabis plants and home herb garden plants, with an estimated expense of $50,000 to $100,000 for 12 months; (v) establishing a relationship with a market research and/or marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, and consumer opinion, explore applications of our intellectual property in the existing wholesale and retail distribution channels for home herb, garden products and legal cannabis markets, and determine the best path for sales, distribution and licensing of our intellectual property, with an estimated expense of $1,000,000 for 12 months. 

Additionally, on May 12, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with a third party under which it acquired four (4) float spa units and associated equipment. With the acquisition of these assets, the Company intends to establish a float spa facility that will allow each guest to customize their wellness experience, at their own pace, based on their individual needs. Once we have approximately $500,000-$1,000,000 in available cash flow or funds from other operations, and after the launch of our dHydronator® sanitizing herb dryer, we plan to capitalize on our spa assets purchased in 2017 by (i) leasing a 2,500 to 5,000 square foot facility in Nevada or California, to be built out as needed (and with the size of the facility dependent on available capital); (ii) obtaining necessary licenses and permits, (iii) purchasing inventory, equipment, furnishings and supplies, including inventory, fixtures, furnishings and equipment for an oxygen bar and a Kampuchea, juice and tea Bar, refrigeration and storage equipment, point of sale computers and tablets, digital monitors, signage and display materials, and other suppliers; (iv) hiring spa management personnel including a manager, assistant manager and two spa attendants; (v) hiring marketing and sales consultants, and (vi) launching a marketing campaign to include internet lead services, Groupon and social networking.

Legacy Crypto-Related Assets

The Company previously focused on acquiring equity or tokens of blockchain technology companies (each a “Target Company”). During calendar 2018, the Company issued shares of its common stock and preferred stock to three Target Companies (see “BurstIQ”, “ImpactPPA”, and “Robot Cache” below) in exchange for rights to digital tokens and/or equity purchase rights in the Target Companies. We did not receive any tokens or equity of any of the Target Companies, and we have now rescinded our agreements with each of the Target Companies. 

BurstIQ

BurstIQ Analytics Corporation (“BurstIQ”) is a healthcare data company. We previously issued 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to BurstIQ in consideration of the Company’s right to acquire tokens and preferred stock of BurstIQ. On May 3, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreements with BurstIQ, and BurstIQ agreed to return 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company for cancellation. 

ImpactPPA

ImpactPPA Limited (“ImpactPPA”) has designed an Ethereum-based decentralized energy platform to potentially transform the global energy finance industry. We previously issued 6,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to ImpactPPA in consideration of the Company’s right to acquire tokens of ImpactPPA. On June 26, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreement with ImpactPPA, and ImpactPPA agreed to return 6,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to the Company for cancellation. 

Robot Cache

Robot Cache, S.L. (“Robot Cache”) is the first decentralized PC video game distribution platform with a revolutionary digital resale model designed to utilize blockchain technology. We previously issued 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, and warrants to acquire additional common stock, to Robot Cache in consideration of the Company’s right to acquire tokens of Robot Cache. On June 26, 2019, we rescinded our acquisition agreements with Robot Cache, and Robot Cache agreed to return 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company for cancellation. 

As we will never receive any tokens or equity of any of these blockchain-related companies, we do not believe that federal, state, local or foreign regulations affecting blockchain technologies and digital assets (for example, money transmission laws) will have any affect on our business. 

Competition

There are a number of commercial herb dryers sold by competitors, including Yofumo Technologies, which are already commercially available, and which have significant market share. As to our float spa plans, we believe True Rest Float Spa, which has over 20 spa locations across the country, is our primary national competitor, and there are numerous locally owned float spas throughout the country that would considered competitors with our spa operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with any of these competitors.
Market Opportunity

The Company’s herb dryer, the dHydronator®, safely lowers moisture content and sanitizes without harm to the integrity of the plant. Our test results have been proven to dry cannabis in less than 14 hours verses up to 14 days using traditional drying methods. Test results indicate the removal of many surface germs and bacteria including powder mold, dust mites and spider mites from herbs, plants, the surface of glass or ceramic herbal tea accessories, and any other object that fits safely in the drying chamber. Therefore, we believe that our product will be attractive to the cannabis and home herb and garden product markets.

With regard to floatation therapy, the sensory deprivation consumer typically ranges in age from eighteen to eighty. Floatation therapy is a service that is unisex in its appeal and attracts many. As many consumers seek natural alternative therapies for the relief from pain, stress and sleep disorders that affect a significant percentage of the population, we believe that our planned floatation therapy spa facilities will be attractive to these consumers. 

Marketing Strategy

We plan to attend regional cannabis-related trade shows and offer field testing to legal cannabis growers and suppliers in the United States and Canada initially, and throughout the world once the technology has been adopted in the regional market. We also plan to establish a relationship with a market research and marketing company to explore creative strategies, advertising concepts, consumer opinion, existing distribution and sales channels and potential licensing of our intellectual property, to determine the best path for sales and distribution. We also intend to hire subject matter expert consultants or employees in the legal cannabis and home herb marketplace to manage the development and sales of our products. Once our marketing experts identify an herbal or commercial agriculture niche or venue to enter or solicit, we will market to distributors and retailers via trade shows and direct contact.

With regard to our spa plans, we intend to launch internet, Groupon and social networking campaigns offering coupons and membership plans for floatation therapy, and our planned oxygen bar and Kampuchea, juice and tea bar. We plan to invite local TV and Radio personalities to tour our facilities, and we plan to offer local healthcare and rehabilitation service providers and non-competitive spa owners and managers a private tour of our spa facilities.
