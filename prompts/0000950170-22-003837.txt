OUR BUSINESS
 The Membership Collective Group (“MCG”) is a global membership platform of physical and digital spaces that connects a vibrant, diverse group of members from across the world. These members use the MCG platform to both work and socialize, to connect, create, have fun and drive a positive change.
 We began with the opening of the first Soho House in London's Soho district in 1995 and remain the only company to have scaled a private membership platform with a global presence. Over the last 26 years, we have significantly expanded our membership expertise and diversified our offerings—both physically and digitally. As of January 2, 2022, we have over 155,800 members (including over 122,800 Soho House members) who engage with MCG through our global portfolio of 33 Soho Houses, 9 Soho Works, Scorpios Beach Club in Mykonos, Soho Home, The Ned in London, in addition to our digital channels. The LINE and Saguaro hotels in North America, which we operate under a hotel management contract, also form part of MCG’s wider portfolio.
 The central pillar of MCG is Soho House, which drives the majority of our membership and revenue today. Since the opening of our first House in London in 1995, we have successfully identified the demand for a premium membership offering that caters to a progressive, creative and diverse global audience. Today, we believe our membership offering, consistently high standards of service, and our global footprint remain unparalleled. A Soho House membership offers access to a network of distinctive and carefully curated Houses, across North America, the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, which serve as the cornerstone of our member

experience. We enhance our member experience through our digital channels, including the SH.APP and our website. Our vision for the SH.APP has always been for it to be like having a House in your pocket. It’s our destination for members to make bookings and payments, to connect with each other and access engaging video content and podcasts — made for our members, by our members. Annually, we host thousands of physical and digital member events worldwide, spanning film, fashion, art, food and drink, well-being, work and music—and help our members forge connections with each other to bring them closer together.
 Our membership expertise, honed through the growth of Soho House, has led to our evolution into the Membership Collective Group, a home to numerous memberships including Cities Without Houses, Soho Works, Soho Friends, Soho House Digital, SOHO HOME+ and Ned’s Club. By designing, curating and growing our membership offering, our membership platform can respond to shifting lifestyle trends and the evolution of our members’ needs. Our memberships work together, allowing us to reach new audiences with a set of interconnected offerings.
 Everything we do across these memberships begins and ends with our members. The foundation of our member experience has been crafted over our 26-year history and is built on the following pillars:
 •Membership: We are in the business of forging connections and bringing people together. Our diverse global membership is the soul of our company. It is the people that define our culture and shape the experience – in turn attracting new members.
 •Physical and digital spaces: We create and operate interconnected spaces. Each of our physical locations is designed to reflect our members and the local community that they serve. Our digital platforms extend our connection with members beyond our physical spaces, in turn significantly enhancing the member experience.
 •Design: Our design DNA is instantly recognizable across all of our membership models, whether in our Houses, Soho Works, The Ned, Scorpios Beach Club or Soho Home. While each House is unique, they each have a consistency in their architectural and interior style that has come to define the Soho House experience. In each new House or site that we develop for our other brands, this style is interpreted for local tastes and preferences, reflecting the culture of the respective city.
 •Services, products and experiences: Our member-obsessed culture drives us to relentlessly improve the quality of the services, products and experiences we offer to our members. We do not cut corners or compromise on quality, taking the long-term view that there is no substitute for the highest quality services, products and experiences when it comes to fostering loyalty from our members.
 •Innovation: We have always strived to adapt and evolve by anticipating our members’ needs and wants. Innovation has always been part of our culture and approach, and we have used that mindset to create new memberships to serve a wider audience of people who desire personal connection via new channels.
 •House Foundations: We are committed to integrating the pillars of our social responsibility and sustainability program, House Foundations, into everything we do.
 Our membership has remained resilient through multiple economic cycles and the COVID-19 pandemic. When our physical sites were forced to close as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was minimal impact on the retention of Soho House members. The power of our model is driven by the important role we believe that we play in our members’ lives and the value we consistently provide them for their membership fees. We believe our retention compares very favorably to leading consumer subscriptions or memberships—across music, media, fitness, entertainment and commerce—despite, in many cases, their significantly lower price points.
 The demand for our membership is also demonstrated by our large and growing global wait list, which as of January 2, 2022 stands at over 70,000 applicants. Awareness of our distinct membership offerings and their scarcity is spread by our members organically through word of mouth, social media and press coverage.
 There are multiple consumer forces at play that have increased the relevance of our memberships. We have observed a secular shift in the ways that people live and work—with less time spent in traditional corporate offices and more time in social spaces that encourage creativity and mutual engagement. We believe that these trends will only accelerate, and that the freedom to be able to choose where to live and work—particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic—will likely have a significant impact on our target market. We believe this will create an even greater demand for curated communities that can grow and thrive in a more deliberate environment.
 Membership revenues are comprised of annual membership fees and one-time initial registration fees paid by members. In-House revenues include all revenues realized within our Houses, including food and beverage, accommodation, and spa products and treatments. Other revenues include all revenues not realized within our Houses, including Scorpios, Soho Works and standalone restaurants, design and procurement fees from Soho House Design and Soho Home among others. We view Membership revenues and In-House revenues as interrelated, insofar as although there is no minimum spend for any member on our In-House offerings that

generate In-House revenues. In practice the significant majority of In-House revenues are generated by our members, and the pricing of our In-House offerings reflects that accordingly, with pricing of such In-House offerings being identical for both members and non-members.
 OUR ASSET LIGHT STRATEGY
 Historically we have made significant investments in the development of our Houses, either in purchasing an ownership position and/or making material investment in the build out of the property alongside our landlords. Beginning several years ago, with the growing reputation of Soho House as a marquee tenant, we began making a conscious shift to an asset light development model to conserve and drive improved return on our capital. Under this model, our landlord agrees to fund a substantial portion, or all, of the development costs of a House, to our design specifications, leaving us to fund only pre-opening expenses (and art and other unique interior design elements). Virtually all of the Houses that we plan to open over the next three years reflect this asset-light model.
 While our investment in our full-size Houses has historically approached, or in certain cases exceeded, $10 million, under our asset-light model we expect our contribution to open new Houses, comprised primarily of pre-opening expenses and art, will fall in the $3 million to $6 million range. Despite a modest increase in average rents from this strategy, we believe the considerably reduced capital investment will result in meaningfully improved cash-on-cash returns and capital efficiency.
 
A new Soho House membership incurs virtually no membership acquisition cost, since we do not conduct any paid marketing. Driven by consistently high retention and minimal costs associated with retaining or supporting our members, Soho House enjoys a very attractive member lifetime value. We believe new memberships will also provide compelling economics and be accretive to our profit, as they can be created and operated in an asset-light manner that leverages the existing platform.
 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
 Our operations consist of three reportable segments and one non-reportable segment that we present as “all other”. Each of our segments includes all operations in that region including our Houses and all associated facilities, spas and stand-alone restaurants.
 Our three reportable segments and our “other” segment are as follows:

 •Our eleven Soho Houses in and around London;
 •Two townhouses encompassing bedrooms and public restaurants, twelve stand-alone restaurants and four Apartments; and

 •Four stand-alone US restaurants;
 •Soho Friends – US membership fees; and
 •The management fees under our hotel management contract for the operation of the LINE and Saguaro Hotels. 
 Europe and Rest of the World ("ROW"). This segment encompasses operating units in continental Europe and RoW, currently comprised of:
 •Nine Houses in Europe including Soho House Barcelona and Little Beach House Barcelona, which are joint venture entities, and Soho House Istanbul which is under a management agreement;
 •Soho House Hong Kong and the management fees from Soho House Mumbai;
 •Our majority interest in Scorpios Beach Club Mykonos; and
 •Soho Friends – Europe membership fees.
 All Other. Includes the following:

 OUR MEMBERSHIP PLATFORM
 All of our memberships have been built to enrich the lives of their members, as well as expand our membership offering to a broader audience.
 Soho House
 Soho House remains at the core of our membership platform by creating a foundation upon which additional membership businesses can be built and scaled. While our physical Houses provide our foundation, the people inside them are the soul of Soho House. As a membership founded for the creative industries, we are proud to have championed members who have gone on to shape our cultural landscape as world class writers, artists, performers, directors, founders, designers, and producers – all reflecting the spirit and energy of Soho House.
 The membership of each House is assembled by a select committee of influential creatives and innovators that represent the local area in which the membership is founded. Our members actively engage in creating the culture of each House, helping to shape and localize it by participating in member events and contributing to editorial and digital content. We believe this adds to the value of each House, enriching the membership and enhancing the attractiveness of membership to prospective members worldwide. With a US Every House annual membership fee as of February 28, 2022 of approximately $4,000, which provides access to all of our Houses globally, we believe our membership offering provides compelling value to our members that increases as we add new Houses and more members to our global community. Our Houses attract members from every demographic, with members from “Generation Z” (21 years old and younger) and “Millennials”(22- to 37-year-olds) constituting the fastest-growing cohorts. We also believe that the pricing of our In-House offerings represents great value to our members because of the level of quality provided, reinforcing the overall membership experience, rewarding their brand loyalty and creating opportunities for future and recurring revenues.
 We created the following additional types of membership under Soho House to reach a broader audience and enhance the experience of our existing members:
 •Cities Without Houses
 In 2017, we introduced a new type of Soho House membership known as Cities Without Houses ("CWH"), which opens up the Soho House membership to people who live in cities where we do not yet have a physical House. This membership allows us to welcome members to our global community in new geographies, generates additional revenues on our existing base of Houses and provides intelligence for future growth, which we have employed to open new Houses in certain locations, including in Austin, Texas (May 2021), Tel Aviv (August 2021), Paris (September 2021) and Rome (October 2021). We had 4,652 CWH members across 44 cities as of January 2, 2022.
 •Soho House Digital Membership
 The ambition for Soho House has always been to create a truly global membership that brings creative people together, from all over the world. We believe that we will be able to achieve this through the introduction of Soho House Digital Membership—a new, paid digital-only membership that we are now actively working on. Not limited by our physical footprint, Soho House Digital Membership will expand our global reach, allowing us to move further into Asia, Africa and South America, adding fascinating creatives from dynamic cities to our membership.
 Soho House Digital Membership will be subject to the same application and approval process as Soho House membership, allowing like-minded individuals to connect, communicate and collaborate with each other, in a purely digital space through the SH.APP. It will make our membership truly diverse, and will enable the best creatives from all over the world to make meaningful connections with each other. In the same way that we’ve grown Cities Without Houses membership, we will use our connections and liaisons on the ground in new cities to build awareness of digital membership, growing it organically through existing creative communities.
 By leveraging our digital platforms in this way, and removing the reliance on physical spaces to experience the benefits of our membership, we have created a gateway to previously untapped growth opportunities. We believe this new membership type will be attractive to potential members who are already used to socializing, networking and working digitally. Existing Soho House members will also receive the full functionalities of the Soho House Digital Membership, and therefore, the introduction of the Soho House Digital Membership only serves to improve the richness of their membership experience, making it more valuable – with new opportunities to connect with and consume content from a truly global and diverse membership base.
 

•Soho Friends
 There are a significant number of people who enjoy the Soho House way of living and who have already visited our Houses as guests, stayed in our bedrooms, or visited our public restaurants and spas, but do not currently have a Soho House membership. To respond to this audience, we launched Soho Friends in November 2020 for an annual subscription cost of $130. We offer access to physical spaces, including Soho House bedrooms, and Studio spaces (our new social spaces for Soho Friends and Soho House members) that host curated programs of events and screenings, with additional benefits from our restaurants, spas and online retail brands, although Soho Friends do not have full access to our Houses. As of January 2, 2022, we had 23,453 Soho Friends members. We intend to grow this membership brand in a measured way so that our Soho House members continue to account for the majority of visitors to our Houses and restaurants.
Soho Home
 Soho Home was created as a result of requests from our members to recreate the look and feel of the Houses in their own homes. Soho Home is an interiors and lifestyle retail brand that offers handcrafted furniture, lighting, textiles, tableware and accessories through ecommerce. Over the past year, we have transformed Soho Home into a high growth retail business, and in October 2020, we launched SOHO HOME+, which is a subscription-based membership platform with 4,560 members as of January 2, 2022, that offers price discounts, free delivery, and expert design advice plus early access to new collections and seasonal sales for an annual price of $95. We opened two Soho.Home.Studios in 2021, in London and New York. These sites are retail spaces showcasing the latest Soho Home ranges.
Soho Works
 First launched in 2015, Soho Works provides its members with the space and resources to work alongside other like-minded individuals and businesses—facilitating connections and providing the tools to flourish. Aimed at existing Soho House and Soho Friends members, Soho Works draws on the same design principles and membership ethos as Soho House, but is a space purposed entirely for work and creative collaboration.
 Beginning with one location in London, we have since opened eight additional sites in London, New York and Los Angeles over the last two years and as of January 2, 2022, we had 5,016 members. Soho Works membership rates vary by location and Soho House membership status. For Soho House members, a US Soho Works membership ranges from $100 to $650 per month, depending on membership type.
Scorpios Beach Club
 Set in a cove on the southern tip of Mykonos, Scorpios offers a one of a kind beach experience with a well-established globally recognized brand. With a restaurant, terraces and daybeds, and a distinctive wellness offering, Scorpios enriches the lives of its guests who are looking to escape from their daily lives. We believe the Scorpios concept has significant potential to expand into additional locations as a key part of our platform and we expect to open our second site in Tulum, Mexico at the end of 2022.
The Ned
 The Ned has created a new space in the heart of the City of London for its members to meet, eat, drink and socialize. The Ned brand seeks to embody a “city within a city” full-service destination, by playing host to multiple restaurants, bedrooms, a range of grooming services, spa, gym and a full service members’ club. The membership offered by The Ned (“Ned’s Club”) is aimed at a broader group of professional people. As of January 2, 2022, Ned’s Club had just over 2,800 members, and intends to expand into additional cities beyond London. We have recently launched Ned Friends – a more accessible membership similar to Soho Friend for frequent visitors and customers of The Ned. We receive management fees under our hotel management contract for the operation of The Ned.
 The LINE
 On June 22, 2021, we acquired the operating agreements relating to the ‘The LINE’ and ‘Saguaro’ hotels. The hotels that are currently operational are located in Los Angeles, Washington, Austin, Scottsdale and Palm Springs, and among them offer a variety of food and beverage offerings together with approximately 1,470 hotel rooms. A further hotel is under development in San Francisco. We receive management fees under our hotel management contract for the operation of these hotels. We believe the transaction will broaden our geographic reach in North America. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Acquisitions for further information.
 OUR GROWTH PLAN
 We are still in the early stages of our expansion and we believe our track record as well as our core capabilities have positioned us to achieve significant and sustained growth over the coming years through the following initiatives:
Open new Soho Houses
 Expansion into new areas is exciting for us and our members, and both furthers the reach of and strengthens our brand. Opening Houses in existing cities satisfies unmet demand (as represented by our local wait lists), and leverages our existing infrastructure.
 Since January 1, 2018, we have opened 14 new Houses, increasing our total House count to 33 Houses as of January 2, 2022. Our recent development pipeline has extended our global footprint to exciting cities such as Tel Aviv, Paris, Rome and Austin. Additionally, we plan new destination experiential Houses, such as a wellness retreat in Lake Arrowhead and a ranch in Sonoma. We continue to see substantial long-term growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific, Africa and South America regions. We currently anticipate a long-term growth target of five to seven Soho House openings annually over time. Our current pipeline anticipates our Soho House portfolio expanding to 46 Houses by year-end 2023.
Notably, aside from the temporary closure of certain Houses for public health and safety reasons (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or for refurbishment, we have never closed a House at any point in our 26-year history. We have a proven track record of consistently opening successful new sites that achieve member growth targets and generate strong long-term unit economics.
 Continue to scale existing memberships
 Expand Soho Friends membership
In 2019, there were over one million non-member guests who visited our Houses, many of whom visited frequently. Our intention is to continue to convert these customers into Soho Friends members. We recently introduced our House Guest system to collect data and better understand our customers and visitors, which has created a foundation to scale Soho Friends.
Expand Soho Home and Soho Home+ membership
In fiscal 2021, Soho Home grew its online sales by 61%, benefiting both from a newly designed product range, a reinvigorated website as well as a favorable market backdrop due to more customers shopping online and shopping for homeware. In October 2020 we launched SOHO HOME+, the UK’s first homeware subscription service, and gained over 4,500 members as of January 2, 2022, providing a recurring membership revenue stream. We believe Soho Home has significant potential to continue its strong digital-first growth, followed by the expansion of physical retail spaces. We opened two Soho.Home.Studios in 2021, in London and New York. These sites are retail spaces showcasing the latest Soho Home ranges.
 Grow Soho Works
In recent years, we have expanded Soho Works by adding new locations as well as adding new members to the existing locations and developing our Soho Works digital platform. We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow Soho Works in locations that are primarily located next to existing Soho House sites, due to changes in the way that people live and work – with less time spent in traditional corporate offices and more time in social communities.
Open new Scorpios Beach Club Sites
 Scorpios will play a critical role in providing a must-visit destination for many of our members, striving for a unique experience with a particular focus on wellness. Scorpios, in Mykonos, currently attracts an affluent, internationally diverse and loyal customer base, which gives us confidence in the appetite for future locations and a future membership brand. We plan to open one new Scorpios Beach Club per year from 2022 onwards with our second site due to open in Tulum, Mexico at the end of 2022.
Expand the Ned
 The Ned has identified at least one additional site for opening in New York during 2022, and also plans to open another by the end of 2023. There are plans to continue opening one to two new sites for The Ned annually going forward. The Ned will play a meaningful role in broadening our target audience, who crave an authentic membership experience. We have a management contract for the existing operation of The Ned in London and receive management fees for our operation of The Ned.
 Launch and grow new memberships
 The digital-only membership will leverage our existing digital platform, which is being developed to include new features that enable meaningful digital exchange. Members with this membership will have an enriched profile, be able to search for other members, be recommended to other members, grow their digital network, and communicate through direct messaging, audio and video. Through proof of concept, we know that members see value in connecting for social, work and practical purposes. We are now building and finessing this membership type and are confident of launching a valuable digital product. Like our current membership types, the digital membership will continue to evolve post launch based on member feedback.


Our track record gives us the confidence to successfully scale new memberships globally, while providing us with the insight necessary to understand where to extend the Membership Collective Group Inc. platform. Our know-how of operating physical spaces and complementing that with sophisticated digital offerings, will help further extend our offer. For instance, the digital platform will extend Soho House’s digital assets – in connections, bookings, content and payments – through the SH.APP and our websites – to new memberships, business areas (e.g. wellness) and business acquisitions.
 HOUSE FOUNDATIONS
 House Foundations is our social responsibility and sustainability program that represent the foundations of our House built on the following pillars:
 •Diversity and Inclusion: We are committed to building an inclusive culture and helping to make the creative industries more accessible. We value diversity and want our members and teams to be represented in places where everyone feels at home
 •Soho Sustainability: We have a responsibility to play our part in building a more sustainable world. We are in the early stages of an ambitious sustainability program, covering everything from where we source our food to how we build our Houses
 •Soho Mentorship: In partnership with Creative Mentor Network, Routes In and Creative Futures Collective, our mentoring program pairs members with young people pursuing creative careers
 •Soho Talent: We provide opportunities for creative people to gain funding and support to bring their endeavors to life across art, design, music, film, and food and drink
 •Soho Give: A foundation set up to support our chosen charitable initiatives
 •Soho Chance: An annual award giving entrepreneurs and creatives the opportunity to work with our teams to launch a new business, concept or design in one of six areas
 •Soho Apprenticeship: Apprenticeship programs for people living locally to our Houses was launched in 2021.
 SEASONALITY
 Our results are not materially subject to seasonality fluctuations as our revenues are typically consistent on a quarterly basis throughout the year.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our portfolio of brand offerings, including Soho House, Soho Works, Scorpios, The Ned, Cowshed, Soho House Design, Soho Home and Cecconi’s are very important to us. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, know-how and expertise, registered domain names, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how and brand, by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the US and other jurisdictions, as well as on contractual measures. As of February 28, 2022, we owned approximately 78 registered US trademarks, 18 pending US trademark applications, 502 registered non-US trademarks and 67 pending non-US trademark applications. As of February 28, 2022, we owned approximately 710 US and international registered domain names, including www.sohohouse.com and www.membershipcollectivegroup.com.
 
Our strategy for opening any operation is to register national trademarks early in the process of expanding into new territories to prevent third parties from trademark squatting and registering their own competing trademarks before us. However, the efforts we take and have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. For example, brand squatting is an issue for us, particularly in places such as South America and Asia. In China and Australia, the presence of third-party rights holders with ‘Soho’ trademarks has made registering our ‘Soho House’ trademark a challenge. Where there are third-party rights in a particular jurisdiction, we generally assess the risk associated with such rights and take steps to oppose or negotiate with the trademark owner as appropriate, to protect our family of brands from dilution and customer confusion. Additionally, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us. Our trademarks have in the past and may in the future be opposed, contested, circumvented or found to be unenforceable, weak or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating them. To counter infringement or unauthorized use of our trademarks, we may deem it necessary to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our intellectual property rights are

valuable, and any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property, including due to ‘brand squatting,’ could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.
 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DATA PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY
 We are committed to protecting the security of member data and other personally identifiable information ("PII"). We undertake measures to protect our systems, including the SH.APP, and the member data and other PII that our systems collect, store, share, transmit, disclose and otherwise process. We have developed policies and procedures designed to manage data security risks. We employ technical security defenses, monitor servers and systems, and use technical measures such as data encryption. We also use third parties to assist in our security practices as well as to prevent and detect fraud. We are subject to a number of stringent, complex and evolving federal, state and local data protection, privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and other legal obligations in the US and around the world. Any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable federal, state, local or similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, policies, certifications or orders relating to data privacy and security, or any compromise of security, including in connection with the SH.APP, that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of PII or other member data, could result in significant awards, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties or judgments, proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions and negative publicity and reputational harm, one or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Technology and Data—A cybersecurity attack, ‘data breach’ or other security incident experienced by us or our third-party service providers may result in negative publicity, claims, investigations and litigation and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Technology and Data—If we fail to properly maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our data, including member and customer credit or debit card and bank account information and other PII, or if we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy, protection and security, it may adversely affect our reputation, business and operations.”
 
We expect to continue to invest in technology capabilities to support, protect and drive our business.
 EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 As of February 28, 2022, Soho House employed 6,353 individuals including in our support offices of whom 667 are based at our support offices in London, New York and Los Angeles.
 Labor laws in the United Kingdom and European Union provide minimum standards regarding annual paid and unpaid leave, sick leave, maternity leave and other provisions regarding leave from work, severance pay, pension contributions and other terms of employment. We contribute to pension schemes (or similar type schemes) for our employees in the United Kingdom and European Union.
 We are committed to a policy of recruitment, promotion and training on the basis of aptitude and ability. We have dedicated Diversity, Learning, and Inclusion teams across all four of our major regions of the Americas, United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia, and we offer a wide range of training and development programs. Training offered includes customer service and leadership courses to food tasting and cocktail training, first aid at work and health and safety courses. Diversity & Inclusion forms part of all training we conduct, as well as its own learning series designed for Senior Leadership to line staff level. We also operate dedicated Cook House and House Tonic training programs for our chefs and bartenders to ensure that each customer receives consistent food and drink across all of our Houses and restaurants. We are committed to encouraging people development and retention, including by providing sponsorship so that employees can increase know-how and widen their skill bases by attending third-party training and courses. We also operate a group-wide program that rewards employees that go the extra mile.
 We have built a robust pledge and commitment to Diversity & Inclusion across all our functions in areas of representation, recruitment, culture, education, community engagement, and accountability. Our mission statement and values set have also been rewritten to support these initiatives. In our pledge we have committed to increasing the BIPOC representation in our leadership, as well as any underrepresented functions like Design and Retail — and we are able to achieve this by extensive outreach to diverse organizations and networks in our recruitment initiatives. We have rolled out a global training series on anti-racism and allyship and we have built an internal diversity steering committee consisting of a mix of employees from all levels across the global business to hold our executives accountable for the delivery of this pledge. Our employee handbook reflects progressive policies regarding Parental Leave, Flexible Working, and Company Sick Pay. We have developed a performance driven culture with feedback platforms that allow for objective evaluations of our staff and development plans for their growth.


With a view to building a strong community within our workforce, we have implemented dedicated communication channels for employees, led by Facebook Workplace.
 COMPETITION
 We believe that we are the only company to have pioneered and scaled a private membership club platform with global presence, and our first-mover advantage has created a significant barrier to entry.
 Though we face direct competition from other private members’ clubs that exist in proximity to our own Houses (as well as in numerous segments of the restaurant, hotel, co-working spaces, fitness and beauty care services and products industries), we believe that we do not have a direct competitor given the combination of different sectors in which we operate, combined with our geographical reach. Some membership clubs use a similar model, but we do not believe that they have been able to replicate our reach across the multiple cities, continents, and spaces in which we operate. In our view, there is a high barrier to entry, as to catch up with the size of our platform would take significant time and investment.
 We believe that these business sectors are each highly competitive. Primary competitive factors include name recognition, demographic considerations, effectiveness of public relations and brand recognition, level of service, convenience of location, quality of the property, pricing, product or service and range and quality of services and amenities offered.
 We also compete with other restaurants, boutique hotels, co-working spaces, beauty care providers and retailers on a local level, as well as on a global level against certain larger chains with properties in the markets in which we operate.
 REGULATION
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building, zoning and environmental requirements, health and safety and fire codes, data privacy, protection and security and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we design, construct, manage, lease and/or own properties. In addition, the retail nature of a portion of our business requires us to comply with laws and regulations concerning product safety and testing, as well as consumer rights. Our ability to develop new Houses and privately commissioned projects and to remodel, refurbish or add to our existing Houses is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities.
 Regulations concerning the supply and sale of alcoholic beverages require us to apply to relevant local authorities for a license that must be renewed (usually on an annual basis) and which may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Applicable alcoholic beverage control regulations and licensing conditions apply to the supply of alcohol across our business, including in relation to the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.
 We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings. Federal, state and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific standards of conduct and other practices with respect to issuance of memberships.
 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
 We are committed to providing safe and healthy premises, that are compliant with environmental, health and safety regulations, for our members and other customers to enjoy and our colleagues to work in. Our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety requirements in the UK, the US and every other country and locality in which we operate. We have an internal team of safety professionals who support the business through providing advice and guidance on compliance and best practices, auditing and monitoring site conditions along with compliance with both our safety management system and legislative requirements, and updating our environmental, health and safety management systems in light of new or changes to existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been at the forefront of our minds. Working alongside our operations and people teams, and in collaboration with public health teams globally, the safety team supported the successful re-opening of all our sites in accordance with the relevant local restrictions in force. This included introducing new physical measures to create safe spaces that reduce the risk of transmission (screens, mask wearing, reduced capacities to increase distancing, enhanced ventilation and cleaning regimes and providing hand sanitizer throughout our spaces), training all our colleagues on the new measures to protect

themselves and our guests, and creating a robust internal contact tracing system to rapidly identify and isolate any colleagues (or guests) who may have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive individual.
 From time to time, our operations or products have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental, health and safety laws or regulations. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new, or changes to existing, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
