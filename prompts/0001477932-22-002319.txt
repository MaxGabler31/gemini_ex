Item 1. Business.

First Foods Group, Inc. (the “Company” or “First Foods”) is a smaller reporting company focused on developing its specialty chocolate product line through its Holy Cacao subsidiary, participating in merchant cash advances (“MCAs”) through its 1st Foods Funding Division, and introducing new health-related brands, concepts and products through its FFGI Wholesaling Division.

Holy Cacao is a majority owned subsidiary that is dedicated to producing, packaging, distributing and selling specialty chocolate products, including specialty chocolate products infused with a hemp-based ingredient in accordance with the Company’s understanding of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”) and/or the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill,” and together with the 2014 Farm Bill, collectively, the “Farm Bill”), which renders the production of hemp in compliance with the provisions of the Farm Bill federally lawful. The Company has not been, is not, and has no current plans to be involved in producing, packaging, distributing or selling any product that is infused with a marijuana-based ingredient, although it intends to revisit the matter as regulations change in jurisdictions in which it operates.

The Company is also dedicated to licensing its intellectual property (“IP”), including its name, brand, and packaging, to third parties. The Company may license its IP to third parties that may produce, package, and distribute hemp-based products pursuant with the Company’s understanding of the Farm Bill. The Company may license its IP to third parties that may produce, package, and distribute marijuana-based products, but only as such licensing is legal. Holy Cacao holds four trademarks for the brands, “The Edibles Cult”, “Purely Irresistible”, “Mystere” and “Southeast Edibles”.

The Company also has a contract with TIER Merchant Advances LLC (“TIER”) to participate in the purchase of future receivables from qualified TIER merchants for the purpose of generating revenue for the Company. The Company also provides cash advances directly to merchants.

OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We are primarily focused on developing our specialty chocolate product line and related IP through our Holy Cacao subsidiary. We have developed twenty-three (23) proprietary recipes for our specialty chocolate product line that we have tested in a fully staffed and fully equipped state of the art manufacturing facility. We actively market our specialty chocolate product line on a full-time basis through multiple distribution and sales agreements, as well as through multiple industry specific trade shows, through our on-line website presence, and through our ongoing collaboration with a diverse team of leading industry consultants who specialize in media relations, public relations, and investor relations.

We are secondarily involved in introducing new health-related brands, concepts and products through our FFGI Wholesaling Division and participating in merchant cash advances through our First Foods Funding Division. The Company participates in the merchant cash advance industry by directly advancing sums to a merchant or a merchant advance provider, TIER, who in turn advances sums to merchants or other merchant cash advance providers.

TARGET MARKET AND OUR NICHE WITHIN

Our highest priority target market consists of chocolate wholesalers who have a desire to distribute our specialty chocolate products infused with a hemp-based ingredient to select retailers throughout the United States.

Our secondary target market consists of health-related products and merchant cash advance participations. We are aware of an increasing demand for lending services and products for small businesses, and we believe the merchant cash advance market is in a growth mode that presents us with significant opportunity. Furthermore, we believe the small business lending market is underserved and the ability of small businesses to obtain credit with traditional banking institutions is difficult. Our niche approach is to participate with other syndicated participants in a broad range of merchant cash advances, as well as selectively issue merchant cash advances directly to merchants we know well.

COMPETITION, OUR COMPETITIVE STRATEGY AND METHODS OF COMPETITION

Our competition consists of companies that operate in the specialty hemp-based chocolate and related health products industry. Our competitive strategy is to target the consumers of health-related products and specialty, high-end chocolate products infused with a hemp-based ingredient.
MARKETING, MARKETING OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

The Company markets its products to existing and emerging food service companies, focusing specifically on brand development.

Our Marketing Objectives are as follows:


• | Establishing and promoting our presence in our selected targeted market; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Building a network of food service industry professional relationships and referrals.


To promote and market our products, we have invoked the following strategies:


• | Continued to enhance our online presence via our Company website reflecting our scope of products offered. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Continued online retail sales through our Southeast Edibles website. 
• | Continued to expand our public relations (PR) campaign to obtain publicity and increase visibility for our business.
• | Retained Michael Kaplan as our Chief Marketing Officer. 


Currently, the Company’s officers and directors promote our products through various channels, including networking at local industry events and Internet sources. The Company does not actively market its merchant cash advance participation because all marketing activities are performed by TIER. We anticipate that, as the Company grows over the next twelve months, pools of expertise will be acquired by recruiting within the food service and health-based wholesaling industry and by using technical and operational consultants, which will allow qualified individuals to join our management team and Board of Directors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company has engaged market and branding consultants to assist its master chocolatier with the research and development of specialty hemp-based chocolate products targeted to particular states within the US.
EMPLOYEES

The Company’s employees consist of, Mark J. Keeley, who is a director and our Chief Financial Officer, Moises Davidovits, who is the Company’s “Master Chocolatier”, and three production assistants who report to Moises. Harold Kestenbaum is a director consultant serving in the role of interim Chief Executive Officer. Abraham Rosenblum is a director serving in the role of Secretary.

Our future business and operating results depend significantly on the continued contributions and active participation of the aforementioned individuals. These individuals would be difficult or impossible to replace. The loss of these key contributors, or their failure to perform, could materially and adversely affect our Company’s operations. While we may obtain key man insurance, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the loss incurred in the event these individuals are lost.

Our officers and directors receive compensation for their services and are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf. We anticipate adding a permanent Chief Operations Officer over the next twelve (12) months and other employees and consultants as deemed necessary. We do not currently have any benefits, such as health or life insurance, available to our employee or directors.
