ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
-------------------

The Company 
 Century Bancorp, Inc. (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the Company) is a Massachusetts state-chartered bank holding company headquartered in Medford, Massachusetts. The Company is a Massachusetts corporation formed in 1972 and has one banking subsidiary (the Bank): Century Bank and Trust Company formed in 1969. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $5.2 billion. Currently, the Company operates 27 banking offices in 20 cities and towns in Massachusetts, ranging from Braintree in the south to Andover in the north. The Banks customers consist primarily of small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in these communities and surrounding areas, as well as local governments and large healthcare and higher education institutions throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York. 
 The Companys results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The results of operations are also affected by the level of income and fees from loans, deposits, as well as operating expenses, the provision for loan losses, the impact of federal and state income taxes and the relative levels of interest rates and economic activity. 
 The Company offers a wide range of services to commercial enterprises, state and local governments and agencies, non-profit organizations and individuals. It emphasizes service to small and medium-sized businesses and retail customers in its market area. The Company makes commercial loans, real estate and construction loans and consumer loans, and accepts savings, time, and demand deposits. In addition, the Company offers to its corporate and institutional customers automated lock box collection services, cash management services and account reconciliation services, and actively promotes the marketing of these services to the municipal market. Also, the Company provides full service securities brokerage services through a program called Investment Services at Century Bank, which is supported by LPL Financial, a third party full-service securities brokerage business. 
 The Company has municipal cash management client engagements in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island comprised of approximately 250 government entities. 
 Availability of Company Filings 
 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 13 and 15(d), periodic and current reports must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Company electronically files with the SEC its periodic and current reports, as well as other filings it makes with the SEC from time to time. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC, at www.sec.gov, in which all forms filed electronically may be accessed. Additionally, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and additional shareholder information are available free of charge on the Companys website: www.centurybank.com. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 403 full-time and 57 part-time employees. The Companys employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. The Company believes that its employee relations are good. 
Financial Services Modernization 
 On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Gramm-Leach) which significantly altered banking laws in the United States. Gramm-Leach enables combinations among banks,

  securities firms and insurance companies beginning March 11, 2000. As a result of Gramm Leach, many of the depression-era laws that restricted these affiliations and other activities that may be engaged in by banks and bank holding companies were repealed. Under Gramm-Leach, bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. 
 In order to engage in these financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the Federal Reserve Board as a financial holding company by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach. 
 These financial activities authorized by Gramm-Leach may also be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, except for insurance or annuity underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investment and development and merchant banking, which must be conducted in a financial holding company. In order for the new financial activities to be engaged in by a financial subsidiary of a national or state bank, Gramm-Leach requires each of the parent bank (and any bank affiliates) to be well capitalized and well managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that banks financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if the bank is one of the 100 largest banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements. The Company does not currently conduct activities through a financial subsidiary. 
 Gramm-Leach establishes a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies will regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies and banks financial subsidiaries, the SEC will regulate their securities activities, and state insurance regulators will regulate their insurance activities. Gramm-Leach also provides new protections against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumers nonpublic, personal information. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 The Company is a bank holding company as defined by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Holding Company Act), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank (the FRB), which is responsible for administration of the Holding Company Act. Although the Company may meet the qualifications for electing to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach, the Company has elected to retain its pre-Gramm-Leach status for the present time under the Holding Company Act. As required by the Holding Company Act, the Company files with the FRB an annual report regarding its financial condition and operations, management and intercompany relationships of the Company and the Bank. It is also subject to examination by the FRB and must obtain FRB approval before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank, unless it already owns or controls a majority of the voting stock of that bank, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, except through a subsidiary which is a bank, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. A bank holding company must also give the FRB prior written notice before purchasing or redeeming its equity securities, if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration paid by the company for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the companys consolidated net worth. 
 The Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company which is not a bank or a bank holding company, or (ii) engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries. A bank holding company may own, however, shares of a company engaged in activities which the FRB has determined are so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries are examined by federal and state regulators. The FRB has regulatory authority over holding company activities and performed a review of the Company and its subsidiaries as of September 2017.

 USA PATRIOT Act 
 Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, also known as the International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, all financial institutions are required in general to identify their customers, adopt formal and comprehensive anti-money laundering programs, scrutinize or prohibit altogether certain transactions of special concern, and be prepared to respond to inquiries from U.S. law enforcement agencies concerning their customers and their transactions. Additional information-sharing among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities is encouraged by the presence of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach Act for financial institutions that comply with this provision and the authorization of the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt rules to further encourage cooperation and information-sharing. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the Holding Company Act or Bank Merger Act. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, signed into law July 30, 2002, addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditor independence and accounting standards, executive compensation, insider loans, whistleblower protection and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The SEC has adopted a substantial number of implementing rules and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted corporate governance rules that have been approved by the SEC and are applicable to the Company. The changes are intended to allow stockholders to monitor more effectively the performance of companies and management. As directed by Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are each required to certify that the Companys quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. This requirement has several parts, including certification that these officers are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting; that they have made certain disclosures to the Companys auditors and the Board of Directors about the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and that they have included information in the Companys quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, and whether there have been significant changes in the Companys internal disclosure controls and procedures or in other factors that could significantly affect such controls and procedures subsequent to the evaluation and whether there have been any significant changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or reasonably likely to materially affect the Companys internal control over financial reporting, and compliance with certain other disclosure objectives. Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires an additional certification that each periodic report containing financial statements fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that the information in the report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company. 
 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the D-F Act) became law. The D-F Act was intended to address many issues arising in the recent financial crisis and is exceedingly broad in scope, affecting many aspects of bank and financial market regulation. The D-F Act requires, or permits by implementing regulation, enhanced prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies inclusive of capital, leverage, liquidity, concentration and exposure measures. In addition, traditional bank regulatory principles such as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders were enhanced. The D-F Act also contains reforms of consumer mortgage lending practices and creates a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which is granted broad authority over consumer financial practices of banks and others. It is expected as the specific new or incremental requirements applicable to the Company become effective that the costs and difficulties of remaining compliant with all such requirements will increase. The D-F Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments to average consolidated assets less tangible equity of financial institutions and also permanently raises the current standard maximum FDIC deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The Act extended unlimited deposit insurance on non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012.

 In addition, the D-F Act added a new Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act, the so-called Volcker Rule, (the Rule) which generally restricts certain banking entities such as the Company and its subsidiaries or affiliates, from engaging in proprietary trading activities and owning equity in or sponsoring any private equity or hedge fund. The Rule became effective July 21, 2012. The final implementing regulations for the Rule were issued by various regulatory agencies in December, 2013 and under an extended conformance regulation compliance was required to be achieved by July 21, 2015. The conformance period for investments in and relationships with certain legacy covered funds was extended to July 21, 2017. Under the Rule, the Company may be restricted from engaging in proprietary trading, investing in third party hedge or private equity funds or sponsoring new funds unless it qualifies for an exemption from the rule. The Company has little involvement in prohibited proprietary trading or investment activities in covered funds and the Company does not expect that complying with the requirements of the Rule will have any material effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operation. The federal banking agencies have issued notices of proposed rulemaking to make certain amendments to the Rule to simply and tailor compliance requirements and to conform the Rule to the EGRRCPA (discussed below). 
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted, which represents the most comprehensive reform to the U.S. tax code in over thirty years. The majority of the provisions of the Tax Act took effect on January 1, 2018. The Tax Act lowered the Companys federal tax rate from 34% to 21%. Also, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) has been repealed. For 2018 through 2021, the AMT credit carryforward can offset regular tax liability and is refundable in an amount equal to 50% (100% for 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the tax year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Accordingly, it is anticipated that the full amount of the alternative minimum tax credit carryforward will be recovered in tax years beginning before 2022. The Tax Act also contains other provisions that may affect the Company currently or in future years. Among these are changes to the deductibility of meals and entertainment, the deductibility of executive compensation, the dividend received deduction and net operating loss carryforwards. Tax Act changes for individuals include lower tax rates, mortgage interest and state and local tax limitations as well as an increase in the standard deduction, among others. 
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act 
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the EGRRCPA, became law. This is arguably the most significant financial institution legislation since the D-F Act. The EGRRCPA changes certain of the regulatory requirements of the D-F Act and includes provisions intended to relieve the regulatory burden on community banks. Among other things, for qualifying community banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the EGRRCPA contains a safe harbor from the D-F Act ability to repay mortgage requirements, an exemption from the Volcker Rule, may permit filing of simplified Call Reports, and potentially will result in some alleviation of the D-F Act and U.S. Basel III capital mandates. The EGRRCPA requires the federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. The federal banking agencies jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would set the minimum ratio at 9%. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements including the capital ratio requirements that are required to be considered well capitalized under Section 38 of Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 
Deposit Insurance Premiums 
 The Banks deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of assets that it holds. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis.

 On September 29, 2009, the FDIC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. The FDIC Board voted to adopt a uniform three-basis point increase in assessment rates effective on January 1, 2011, and extend the restoration period from seven to eight years. This rule was finalized on November 2, 2009. The Companys quarterly risk-based deposit insurance assessments were paid from this amount until June 30, 2013. The Company received a refund of $2.4 million of prepaid FDIC assessments in June 2013. 
 In February 2011, the FDIC approved a rule to change the assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The rule has kept the overall amount collected from the industry very close to the amount collected prior to the new calculation. 
 In December 2018, the FDIC issued a final rule to implement the EGRRCPA providing a limited exception for a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for qualifying institutions. 
 Risk-Based Capital Guidelines 
 Federal banking regulators have issued risk-based capital guidelines, which assign risk factors to asset categories and off-balance-sheet items. Also, the Basel Committee has issued capital standards entitled Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems (Basel III). The Federal Reserve Board has finalized its rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The rule that came into effect in January 2015 sets the Basel III minimum regulatory capital requirements for all organizations. It included a new common equity Tier I ratio of 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, raised the minimum Tier I capital ratio from 4 percent to 6 percent of risk-weighted assets and would set a new conservation buffer of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the framework did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
Competition 
 The Company experiences substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans from commercial banks, thrift institutions and other enterprises such as insurance companies and mutual funds. These competitors include several major commercial banks whose greater resources may afford them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices and mount extensive advertising campaigns. A number of these competitors are not subject to the regulatory oversight that the Company is subject to, which increases these competitors flexibility.
