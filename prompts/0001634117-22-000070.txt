OVERVIEW
General
Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. (“BNED”) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States. We are also one of the largest textbook wholesalers, inventory management hardware and software providers, and a leading provider of digital education solutions. We operate 1,427 physical, virtual, and custom bookstores and serve more than 6 million students, delivering essential educational content, tools and general merchandise items within a dynamic omnichannel retail environment. Additionally, we offer direct-to-student products and services to help students study more effectively and improve academic performance. 
The strengths of our business include our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with academic partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day® inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. See Retail Segment discussion for additional information. During Fiscal 2022, First Day total revenue increased 91% from the prior year period.
We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our merchandising partnership with Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. (“Fanatics”) and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. (“FLC”) (collectively referred to herein as the “FLC Partnership”), increase market share with new accounts, and expand our strategic opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships. We expect gross general merchandise sales and overall profitability to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online, which we expect to be further enhanced and accelerated through the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our logo and emblematic general merchandise business. Comparable Store general merchandise sales increased by 76.1%, as compared to a 45.9% decline a year ago. See Retail Segment discussion for additional information. 
We believe the Barnes & Noble brand (licensed from our former parent) along with our subsidiary brands, BNC and MBS, are synonymous with innovation in bookselling and campus retailing, and are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important to our relationship with leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels, and for being a trusted source for students in our direct-to-student digital solutions business.
 Technology-enabled learning is a rapid growth area in the higher education industry, as a growing number of students are enrolling in online services to complement print and digital course materials and classroom activities. We continue to enhance our digital content and services in an efficient, low-cost/high-value manner to complement our course materials business. Through our suite of online services, offered by both Student Brands and bartleby.com®, we provide critical services for students to achieve success throughout their academic journey accessible anytime and anywhere. See DSS Segment discussion for additional information.
COVID-19 Business Impact
During Fiscal 2022, our business continued to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings. 
As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. Please see our Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview for further discussion. 
Segments
We identify our segments in accordance with the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance. We have three reportable segments: Retail, Wholesale and DSS. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, continue to be presented as “Corporate Services”. The following discussion provides information regarding the three segments.
RETAIL SEGMENT
General
The Retail Segment operates 1,427 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 805 physical campus bookstores and 622 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate independently or along with our merchant partners, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. Our physical and virtual bookstores, e-commerce sites and digital platforms serve and interact with the key constituents in our business ecosystem and enable us to act as a key partner for students, universities and publishers. 
The Retail Segment offers existing and prospective clients the flexibility of physical, virtual or custom store solutions, which afford students a ship-to-campus option where course materials are conveniently delivered to a centralized campus location. Students have access to the right course materials at the right time, combined with a superior in-house customer service department to help with ordering, delivery, and digital content inquiries. At certain institutions, students also have the flexibility of using financial aid, and proprietary campus debit cards for their course material purchases.
The Retail Segment also offers our First Day and First Day Complete inclusive access programs, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson Education, to distribute their digital content through First Day. In Fiscal 2022, First Day total sales increased by 91% from the prior year. See First Day Inclusive Access Programs discussion below. In addition to First Day programs, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open education resources (“OER”) courseware.
In Fiscal 2022, in the Retail Segment, we signed contracts for 92 new physical and virtual bookstores for estimated first year annual sales of approximately $128 million, which is generally fully achieved as the store becomes fully-operational in their first full year of operations. On a net basis, we generated $102 million in net new business, as we looked to prune some under-performing, less profitable stores, and certain other contracts were awarded to competitors. Currently, we estimate that approximately 30% of college and university affiliated bookstores in the United States are operated by their respective institutions. We anticipate an increasing trend towards outsourcing by schools in the campus bookstore market, and we intend to aggressively pursue profitable new business opportunities to grow our Retail business footprint. We evaluate each new contract based on established profitability measures to ensure we maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts. Our ability to offer existing and prospective clients physical, virtual and custom store solutions is a key element of our competitive strategy.
During Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2022, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of COVID-19 related campus and school closures. Please see our Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Many colleges and K-12 schools were required to cease in-person classes in an attempt to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus and 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
ensure the safety of their students. Although many academic institutions have reopened, some are providing alternatives to traditional in-person instruction, including online and hybrid learning options and significantly reduced classroom sizes. Overall undergraduate higher education enrollment has been significantly negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
As colleges and universities moved to online remote learning, our wholesale operations continued to serve our bookstore and virtual retail customers. Additionally, during the height of the pandemic, our Wholesale operations assumed direct-to-student fulfillment of course material orders for the Retail Segment campus bookstores that were not fully operational due to COVID-19 campus store closures. During Fiscal 2021, our Retail and Wholesale businesses responded very quickly to the store closures, transitioning more than 300 stores to a Custom Store Solutions, or “CSS,” model. Through the CSS model, a customer places their courseware order on a bookstore website, and that order is then directed to the MBS warehouse, which fills and ships the order directly to the customer. This back-end solution is unnoticed by the customer but ensures there is no service delay. It underscores the strength of the virtual and fulfillment capabilities that MBS provides for the company and allows us to support customers through a difficult and uncertain time. 
First Day Inclusive Access Programs
We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day® inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. 
•Through First Day, digital course materials are adopted by a faculty member for a single course, and students receive their materials through their learning management system. 
•First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes all classes, providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sell-through for the bookstore. 
Offering courseware sales through our inclusive access First Day and First Day Complete models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of courseware sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. We expect these programs to allow us to ultimately reverse historical long-term trends in courseware revenue declines, which has occurred at the majority of schools where such programs have been adopted. 
Partnership with Fanatics and FLC 
In December 2020, we entered into the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics’ cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise offers our campus stores expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids (FLC's parent company), the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments. 
We maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus’s brand. We leverage Fanatics’ e-commerce technology and expertise for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. FLC manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus stores. 
In December 2020, Fanatics, Inc. and Lids Holdings, Inc. jointly made a strategic equity investment in BNED. On April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement, we sold our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory to FLC, which was finalized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As contemplated by the FLC Partnership's e-commerce agreement, we began to transition certain of our e-commerce sites to Fanatics e-commerce sites for logo and emblematic products during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Equity and Earnings Per Share.

Contracts
Physical and Custom Campus Bookstore Solutions
We operate 805 physical campus bookstores. Our physical bookstores are typically operated under management agreements with the college or university to be the official college or university bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products sold in-store, online or through learning management systems. We pay the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore and the use of the premises; approximately half of our agreements do not have any minimum guaranteed amount to be paid to our partners. In addition, we have the non-exclusive right to sell all items typically sold in a college bookstore both in-store and online. We also have the ability to integrate the store's systems with the colleges and university’s systems in order to accept student financial aid, university debit cards and other forms of payment. Our decentralized management structure empowers local teams to make decisions based on the local campus needs and fosters collaborative working relationships with our partners. 
We also offer “Custom Store Solutions”, as discussed above, where an institution has a physical on-campus store for general merchandise sales, but course materials are offered virtually and fulfilled direct-to-student (either to an individual address or a central campus pick-up point). Additionally, our virtual-only solutions, discussed below, also have the ability to offer ship-to-campus options. 
The physical bookstore management contracts with colleges and universities typically include five-year terms with renewal options and are typically cancellable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Our campus bookstores have an average relationship tenure of 15 years. From Fiscal 2019 through Fiscal 2022, approximately 90% of these contracts were renewed or extended, often before their termination dates. 
Virtual Campus Bookstore Solutions
We operate 622 virtual campus bookstores. Our virtual bookstores operate under a contract with the school as the exclusive online seller of course materials. We operate as the institution’s official source of course materials with exclusive rights to book lists and access to online programs that link course materials to the courses offered by the school. Our virtual-only solutions typically ship course materials directly to students, but also have the ability to offer ship-to-campus options. 
Virtual bookstore agreements typically have a term that ranges between three to five years, with automatic renewal periods. For the past three years, we have retained over 90% of our contracts annually, with the majority of the contracts being automatically renewed as per the contract terms or renewed before their expiration dates. We pay the school a percentage of sales for the right to be the official college or university bookstore. 
We also operate Textbooks.comSM which is one of the largest e-commerce sites for new and used textbooks. This division is primarily for direct-to-student sales. 
Customers and Distribution Network
As of April 30, 2022, we operate 805 physical college and university bookstore operations and 622 virtual bookstore operations (407 K-12 virtual stores or 65% and 215 Higher Education virtual stores or 35%) located in the United States, in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our Retail sales team is organized by specific territory and offer all solutions (physical, virtual or custom store solutions) to public, state, private, community college, trade and technical, for-profit, online education institutions, including K-12 locations, within their respective territories.
Product and Service Offerings
We offer a broad suite of affordable course materials, including new and used print textbooks (which are available for sale or rent), digital textbooks and publisher hosted digital courseware, at our physical and virtual bookstores, as well as directly to students through Textbooks.com. We offer a robust used textbook selection, unique guaranteed buyback program, dynamic pricing, and marketplace offerings.
We service our physical and virtual bookstores with a comprehensive e-commerce experience and a broad suite of affordable course materials. Additionally, our physical campus stores are social and academic hubs through which students can access affordable course materials, along with emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, technology, school supplies, café offerings, convenience food and beverages, and graduation products. The majority of physical campus stores also have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate independently or along with our merchant partners, and which offer the same products as the on campus stores. 
Product and service offerings include:
•Course Material Sales and Rentals. Sales and rentals of course materials are a core revenue driver, and our faculty and student platforms operate as a seamless extension of our partner schools’ registration, student information and learning management systems. Students can purchase course materials, including new and used print, eTextbooks, and publisher digital courseware platforms, which are available for sale or rent. We work directly with faculty to ensure the course 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
materials they have chosen for their courses are available in all required formats before the start of classes. Our wholesale distribution channel enables our Retail Segment to optimize textbook sourcing, so they are able to more efficiently source and distribute a comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to customers. In Fiscal 2022, we continued to make significant progress in the ongoing rollout of BNC Adoption & Insights Portal (“AIP”), an innovative platform that provides enhanced support for faculty and academic leadership to research, submit and monitor course material selections, further driving affordability and student success.
•Inclusive Access. As discussed above, we offer our BNC First Day® inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete in which course materials are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. We have partnered with VitalSource®, to use their technology to power our First Day inclusive access platform, for digitally formatted courseware, allowing us to accelerate and optimize First Day implementations. We have entered into several agreements with major publishers, including Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education and Pearson, to provide their digital content through First Day. The seamless delivery is made possible by our First Day technology and publishers' technology integrations with campus systems. These initiatives provide students, faculty and institutions greater access to more affordable course materials. First Day offers the inclusive access model on a class-by-class basis, as adopted by the individual instructors on a campus, as compared to our First Day Complete program, in which the entire school adopts the inclusive access model for essentially all of their courses. In Fiscal 2022, First Day programs' total sales increased by 91% from the prior year. First Day Complete offers the delivery of both digital and physical courseware priced at substantial discounts compared to traditional individual student sales offerings. Offering courseware sales through our inclusive access First Day and First Day Complete models is a key and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross margins of courseware sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. 
•eTextbooks. We have partnered with VitalSource®, a global leader in building, enhancing and delivering digital content, on our digital reading platform and digital content catalog. The partnership with VitalSource allows us to use its technology to power our First Day inclusive access platform, for digitally formatted courseware, allowing us to accelerate and optimize First Day implementations. 
•BNC OER+. BNC OER+, a turnkey solution for colleges and universities, offers advanced, affordable learning materials built on a high-quality foundation of OER and enhanced with digital content that includes videos, activities and auto-graded practice assessments that faculty can easily customize to align with class objectives. BNC OER+ significantly reduces course material costs for students and is easy for faculty to implement. BNC OER+ is delivered digitally and can be seamlessly integrated with an institution's campus LMS. Optional print companions of the eTextbook are available to students. In Fiscal 2022, we offered 385 courses, including general education courses, sociology, psychology, economics, business, early childhood and criminal justice. In Fiscal 2022, we had BNC OER+ sales to over 5,400 students at 51 unique colleges and universities, including technical colleges and online programs.
•General Merchandise. For our physical campus bookstores and custom store solutions, we drive general merchandise sales through both in-store and online channels and feature collegiate and athletic apparel, other custom-branded school spirit products, lifestyle products, technology products, supplies, graduation products and convenience items. We continue to see significant growth in our general merchandise e-commerce sales, which has been further bolstered through our FLC Partnership, as discussed above. We have made continued progress in the development of our next generation e-commerce platform, which launched in Fiscal 2021. 
We operate 8 True Spirit e-commerce websites, which are dedicated virtual stores that appeal specifically to the alumni and sports fan base. We also operate pop-up retail locations at major sporting events, such as football and basketball games, for our partner colleges and universities. The True Spirit e-commerce websites for athletic branded merchandise and the physical pop-up retail locations continue to build our partner schools’ brands through alumni and athletics, fostering school spirit and capturing the excitement of collegiate sports. We utilize event driven direct marketing strategies for events, such as tournament playoffs or homecoming events, to target an online population of students, alumni and sports fans, with emails and search engine marketing. 
•Cafés and Convenience Stores. At our physical campus locations, we operate 73 customized cafés, featuring Starbucks Coffee®, as well as regional coffee roasters, and 11 stand-alone convenience stores. Our Café locations and convenience marketplaces offer diverse grab-and-go options including organic, vegan, gluten-free and regional fresh food products. These offerings increase traffic and time spent in our physical stores. As market needs change, we are adapting our model to include more grab-and-go pre-packed fresh food items, simplified menus to reduce food waste and new technology to reduce operating complexity and make the customer experience more efficient. 
•Brand Partnerships. Through our unique relationship with students, colleges and universities, and our premier position on campus and online, we operate as a media channel for brands looking to target the college demographic, and derive 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
revenue from these marketing programs. We also focus on promoting lifestyle products to students and faculty by promoting various brands to connect on a much more personal level. We create strategic, integrated campaigns which include research, email, social media, display advertising, on-campus events, signage, and sampling. Our client list includes brands such as Capital One, College Ave, DirecTV, Dell, Medify Air, Samsung, Shutterfly, The Wall Street Journal, United Airlines, and Verizon. Revenue from these services have higher margin rates due to the relatively low incremental cost structure to provide these services.
Merchandising and Supply Chain Management
Our purchasing procedures vary based on type of bookstore (physical or virtual) and by product type (i.e., course materials, general merchandise or trade books). 
Course Materials and Trade Books
Purchases are made at the bookstore level with strategic corporate oversight to determine purchase quantities and maintain appropriate inventory levels. After titles are adopted for an upcoming term, we determine how much inventory to purchase based on several factors, including student enrollment and the previous term’s course material sales history. For physical campus bookstores, we use an automated sourcing system to determine if another store has the necessary new or used textbooks on hand and may transfer the inventory to the appropriate store. 
The Retail Segment fulfillment order is directed first to our wholesale business before other sources of inventory are utilized. Our wholesale business significantly increases our textbook supply at competitive prices, as well as our ability to liquidate non-returnable inventory. Our broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drive inventory efficiencies by using real-time information regarding title availability, edition status and market prices, allowing the Retail Segment to optimize its course material sourcing and purchasing processes. 
After internal sourcing, the bookstore purchases remaining inventory needs from outside suppliers and publishers. For course material sales and rentals, we utilize sophisticated inventory management platforms to manage pricing and inventory across all stores. Our primary suppliers of new textbooks are publishers, including Pearson Education, Cengage Learning, McGraw-Hill Education, Macmillan Learning, and John Wiley & Sons. Both unsold textbooks and trade books are generally returnable to publishers for full credit. Our primary suppliers of used textbooks are students, through returns of previously rented and purchased books. We offer a “Cash for Books” program in which students can sell their books back to the physical or virtual bookstore at the end of the semester, typically in December and May. Students typically receive up to 50% of the price they originally paid for the book if it has been adopted for a future class or the current wholesale price if it has not. Recently, the impact of fewer students on campus due to COVID-19 has significantly impacted our on-campus buyback programs which supplies Wholesale’s used textbook inventory for future selling periods. 
The larger physical bookstores feature an expanded selection of trade books (general reading). Merchants meet with publishers on a regular basis to identify new titles and trends to support this changing business. 
General Merchandise
General merchandise vendors and product selection is driven by our central merchant organization that is responsible for curating the overall product assortment for the academic year, as well as in partnership with FLC for logo and emblematic general merchandise. Benchmarks are established across school type, region and the demographics of each of our schools to allow for store level insights and customization for a product assortment that is unique to address the needs of each school that we serve. Our ability to support and promote our partner schools’ brands strengthens our relationships with the administration, faculty, alumni, fans, parents and students. 
Our ability to source school supplies and general merchandise sold in our campus bookstores, including technology-related products and emblematic clothing is impacted by broader macro-economic global supply chain issues.
Customer Engagement and Marketing
Campus Community
Our campus relationships and contractual agreements allow us to seamlessly integrate into the college and university community. With direct access to our customer base through both physical and digital channels, we drive awareness, revenue and loyalty for the schools that we serve. We actively market and promote to all segments of our customer base for our physical and virtual bookstores, as well as Textbooks.com. We develop fully-integrated marketing programs to drive engagement with the students, parents, alumni and fans to promote all of our product and services, with a focus on academic course material needs, as well as school spirit, supply, graduation and technology categories. Textbooks.com marketing strategies target an online population of students, lifelong learners, parents and general textbook shoppers through a variety of channels including email, search engine marketing and affiliate marketing.
We have robust research capabilities that keep us ahead of the rapidly changing needs and behaviors of our customers, which allow us to proactively respond with relevant and dynamic solutions. Our Barnes & Noble College Insights® platform 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
connects us to a community of over 11,000 students who help guide and inform our strategies and direction. In addition, we expect to benefit from the FLC Partnership for insights on logo and emblematic merchandise, brand selection and style preferences, as FLC may be able to identify certain retail trends for similar age demographics at their 1,100 Lids retail locations. We believe Lids has its finger on the pulse of the buyer behavior of the 12-20 year old student consumer to identify and act on trends prior to other retailers. 
Our customizable technology delivers a seamless experience providing students and faculty with the ability to research, locate and purchase the most affordable course materials. Our platforms include single sign-on (“SSO”), student information system integration, registration integration, learning management system integration, real-time financial aid platform, point of sale platform and course fee solutions. Through our fully-integrated purchasing process, students can purchase their course materials in-store, online, or when registering for classes.
Faculty and School Administrators
We support faculty and academic leadership with our proprietary online platform which allows content search, discovery and course material adoption, enabling them to offer course materials that are both relevant and affordable for their students.
Seasonality
Our retail business is highly seasonal, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period commencing at point of sale. Revenue from the rental of digital textbooks is recognized at time of sale. 
WHOLESALE SEGMENT
General
The Wholesale Segment is comprised of the wholesale and virtual retail fulfillment, and support operations of our MBS subsidiary. The Wholesale Segment enables the Company to generate more value from the textbook marketplace through inventory and procurement synergies. Since our acquisition of MBS in 2017, we have achieved certain operational and cost synergies by our ongoing integration of various activities and functions, such as new business sales, inventory management, customer support, and information technology support, amongst other activities.
We are one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country, providing a comprehensive selection of new and used textbooks at a lower cost of supply to approximately 3,100 physical bookstores, including our Retail Segment's 805 physical campus bookstores. Our wholesale business also sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 622 virtual bookstores. Additionally, through our Wholesale Segment, we sell hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 350 college bookstores. 
As discussed in the Overview above, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of COVID-19 related campus and school closures. As colleges and universities moved to online remote learning, our wholesale operations continued to serve our bookstore and virtual retail customers. Additionally, the Wholesale operations assumed direct-to-student fulfillment of course material orders for the Retail Segment campus bookstores that were not fully operational due to COVID-19 campus store closures. Together, our Retail and Wholesale businesses responded very quickly to the store closures during Fiscal 2021, transitioning more than 300 stores to a Custom Store Solutions, or “CSS,” model. Through the CSS model, a customer places their courseware order on a bookstore website, and that order is then directed to the MBS warehouse, which fills and ships the order directly to the customer. This back-end solution is unnoticed by the customer but ensures there is no service delay. It underscores the strength of the virtual and fulfillment capabilities that MBS provides for the company and allowed us to support customers through a difficult and uncertain time. 
Product and Service Offerings
Product and Service offerings include:
•Wholesale Textbook Distribution. Our large inventory of used textbooks consists of approximately 280,000 textbook titles in stock, and utilizes a highly automated distribution facility that is capable of processing over 21 million textbooks annually. 
Additionally, we are a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's consignment rental program (which includes approximately 860 titles) and Pearson Education’s consignment rental program (which includes approximately 698 titles). Through our centrally located, advanced distribution center, we offer the seamless integration of these consignment rental programs and centralized administration and distribution to 1,644 stores, including the Retail Segment stores. These consignment rental programs are available to our wholesale customers, including institutionally run and contract managed campus bookstores, as well as our physical and virtual bookstores.
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
•Wholesale Inventory Management, Hardware and POS Software. We sell hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 350 college bookstores. We provide on-site installation for point-of-sale terminals and servers, and offer technical assistance through user training and our support center facility. The cost savings and ease of deployment ensure clients get the most out of their management systems and create strong customer loyalty. 
Supply Chain Management
An extensive national sales force secures a steady supply of high demand used textbooks, which is critical to the success of the wholesale business. A primary supplier of used textbooks are students, through the return of previously rented and purchased books to their campus bookstore. We purchase new and used textbooks from our physical and virtual bookstores, other bookstore operators, institutional bookstores, book dealers, publishers, other distributors and other wholesalers. We offer a “Cash for Books” program in which students can sell their books back to the store at the end of the semester, typically in December and May. Recently, the impact of fewer students on campus due to COVID-19 has significantly impacted our on-campus buyback programs which supply Wholesale’s used textbook inventory for future selling periods. Our ability to source new and used textbooks is also impacted by broader macro-economic global supply chain issues.
Our broad wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems also drives inventory efficiencies, allowing us to optimize our textbook sourcing, purchasing and liquidation processes. We leverage our wholesale distribution channel and warehousing systems to more efficiently source and distribute a robust, comprehensive inventory of affordable course materials to our bookstore customers. Through our proprietary Database Buying Guide, we have access to the best maintained, most accurate, and most complete source of college textbook information available - a key asset that allows us to develop superior supply and demand insights and risk management capabilities.
Customer Marketing Strategies
We have developed deep relationships with our wholesale customer base as a result of our substantial inventory of used textbooks, a comprehensive catalog of textbooks, and superior service and systems support. We continue to maintain a portfolio of profitable accounts, given the demand for used and new textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply. 
Seasonality
Our wholesale business is highly seasonal, as a major portion of sales and operating profit is realized during the first, second and third fiscal quarters, when textbooks are sold for retail distribution.
DIGITAL STUDENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT
General 
The Digital Student Solutions (“DSS”) Segment provides a suite of supplemental learning and study tools that are intended to complement the work that happens in classrooms and tutoring centers on campus. These resources, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, enable students to get the support they need when they need it. DSS is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, and bartleby®, a direct-to-student subscription-based offering providing textbook solutions, expert questions and answers, writing and tutoring services. 
We offer these online solutions to students via the internet, and market our offerings directly to students in our physical and virtual bookstore footprint and nationally to students through search engine optimization. Our physical and virtual bookstore footprint, and associated student relationships, present a sizable addressable market for our digital products and services. 
We continue to expand our ecosystem of products and services through our own internal development, as well as by partnering with other companies to provide products and services designed to improve student success and outcomes.

We provide these services in a subscription-based model. Subscription revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period. 
Customer Marketing Strategies
The ability to address student needs and help improve their success in the classroom and beyond through the bartleby suite of solutions is central to our marketing strategy. We are uniquely positioned to do so by leveraging our bookstore relationships, both physical and virtual, to help accelerate the adoption of our digital products and services. By leveraging our physical and virtual bookstore footprints among students and faculty of both K-12 schools and higher education institutions, we have substantially more opportunities to engage and market to this audience. Our digital marketing efforts are also complemented by leveraging our search engine optimization efforts and through marketing investment in a multi-channel approach that includes other channels such as search engine marketing (“SEM”). For bartleby homework solutions and writing services utilizing marketing and promotional offers, both within our managed bookstore footprint and nationally to students, representing a small percentage of the total addressable market opportunity.
Seasonality
Revenues and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year, although quarterly results may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters.
COMPETITION
We operate within a competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and each of our lines of business face competition for the products and services they offer. As it relates to our full service campus bookstore operations, Follett is the primary competitor for institutional contracts. We also compete with other vendors for mostly smaller accounts, including BBA Solutions, Texas Book Company, and Slingshot. Our online/virtual course material store operations primarily face competition from eCampus and Akademos, and on occasion, Ambassador Educational Solutions. We also face competition from direct-to-student course material channels, including Amazon, Chegg.com, publishers (e.g., Cengage Learning, Pearson Education and McGraw-Hill Education) that bypass the retail distribution channel by selling directly to students and institutions and other third-party websites and/or local bookstores. We face competition from eTextbook/digital content providers VitalSource Technologies, Inc. and Red Shelf, which offer independent bookstores a catalog of digital content and distribution services and also have direct-to-student selling channels for digital materials. 
Competitors for institutional contracts for our cafe and convenience general merchandise offerings include Sodexo and Aramark. Our general merchandise business also faces competition from direct-to-student sales from Walmart, Amazon, Dick’s Sporting Goods, other third-party online retailers, physical and online office supply stores and local and national retailers that offer college-themed and other general merchandise. 
Competitors for our wholesale new and used textbook inventory and distribution include Amazon, BBA Solutions, Nebraska Book Company and Texas Book Company. 
Our DSS Segment faces competition from other digital student solutions providers including Chegg.com, CourseHero, Grammarly, and Quizlet.  As we develop a wider range of products and services, our competitive landscape will change and include other competitors in the broader student services market.
TRENDS AND OTHER BUSINESS CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS
The market for educational materials continues to undergo significant change. As tuition and other costs rise, colleges and universities face increasing pressure to attract and retain students and provide them with innovative, affordable educational content and tools that support their educational development. 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
Current trends, competition and other factors affecting our business include:
•Overall Economic Environment, College Enrollment and Consumer Spending Patterns. Our business is affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall economic environment, funding levels at colleges and universities, by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, and spending on course materials and general merchandise.
•Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted certain segments of the U.S. economy, with legislative and regulatory responses including unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions across all sectors, and there is significant uncertainty as to timing of stabilization and recovery, including the ability to gain adequate herd-immunity levels through vaccine programs and their resilience to future virus variants. Many colleges and K-12 schools have been required to cease in-person classes in an attempt to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus and ensure the safety of their students. Although many academic institutions have reopened, some are providing alternatives to traditional in-person instruction, including online and hybrid learning options and significantly reduced classroom sizes. While many athletic conferences resumed their sport activities, other events, such as parent and alumni weekends and prospective student campus tour activities, may still have been curtailed. Additionally, our business, like many others has been affected by the challenging labor market and the ability to recruit employees. 
•Economic Environment: Retail general merchandise sales are subject to short-term fluctuations driven by the broader retail environment and other economic factors, such as interest rate fluctuations and inflationary considerations. The broader macro-economic global supply chain issues have impacted our ability to source textbooks, school supplies and general merchandise sold in our campus bookstores, including technology-related products and emblematic clothing. A significant reduction in U.S. economic activity could lead to decreased consumer spending. 
•Enrollment Trends. The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new customers and to increase the level of engagement by our current student customers. We continue to see downward enrollment trends. Enrollment trends, specifically at community colleges, generally correlate with changes in the economy and unemployment factors, e.g., low unemployment tends to lead to low enrollment and higher unemployment rates tend to lead to higher enrollment trends, as students generally enroll to obtain skills that are in demand in the workforce. Enrollment trends have been negatively impacted overall by COVID-19 concerns at physical campuses. Additionally, enrollment trends are impacted by the dip in the United States birth rate resulting in fewer students at the traditional 18-24 year-old college age. Online degree program enrollments continue to grow, even in the face of declining overall higher education enrollment. 
•Increased Use of Online and Digital Platforms as Companions or Alternatives to Printed Course Materials. Students and faculty can now choose from a wider variety of educational content and tools than ever before, delivered across both print and digital platforms. 
•Increasing Costs Associated with Defending Against Security Breaches and Other Data Loss, Including Cyber-Attacks. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. We continue to invest in data protection, including insurance, and information technology to prevent or minimize these risks and, to date, we have not experienced any material service interruptions and are not aware of any material breaches.
•Distribution Network Evolving. The way course materials are distributed and consumed is changing significantly, a trend that is expected to continue. The market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.
◦Disintermediation. We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and other course materials. In addition to the official physical or virtual campus bookstore, course materials are also sold through off-campus bookstores, e-commerce outlets, digital platform companies, publishers, including Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill, bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling or renting directly to students and educational institutions, and student-to-student transactions over the Internet. 
◦Supply Chain and Inventory. Since the demand for used textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply, our financial results are highly dependent upon Wholesale’s ability to build its textbook inventory from suppliers in advance of the selling season. Recently, the impact of fewer students on campus due to COVID-19 has significantly impacted our on-campus buyback programs which supplies Wholesale’s used textbook inventory for future selling periods. Some textbook publishers have begun to supply textbooks pursuant to consignment or rental programs which could impact used textbook supplies in the future. Additionally, Wholesale is a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's and Pearson Education’s consignment rental program, both of which are relatively nascent. The broader macro-economic global supply chain issues may also impact our ability to 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
source school supplies and general merchandise sold in our campus bookstores, including technology-related products and emblematic clothing.
◦Price Competition. In addition to the competition in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook and other course materials business faces significant price competition. Students purchase textbooks and other course materials from multiple providers, are highly price sensitive, and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another. 
•A Large Number of Traditional Campus Bookstores Have Yet to be Outsourced.
◦Outsourcing Trends. We continue to see the trend towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market and also continue to see a variety of business models being pursued for the provision of course materials (such as inclusive access programs and publisher subscription models) and general merchandise. 
◦New and Existing Bookstore Contracts. We expect awards of new accounts resulting in new physical and virtual store openings will continue to be an important driver of future growth in our business. We also expect that certain less profitable or essential bookstores we operate may close. Such stores could be included in contracts for stores we operate that may be deemed non-essential; and such stores could be operated by others or independently by schools. The scope of any such store closures remains uncertain, although we are not aware, at this time, of any significant volume of stores which we operate that are likely to close or have informed us of upcoming closures.
GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and in the education industry, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations, will apply in the e-commerce and online context, including, but not limited to such topics as privacy, antitrust, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, sweepstakes, promotions, content regulation, financial aid, scholarships, student matriculation and recruitment, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example:
The Controlling and Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”) and similar laws adopted by most U.S. states, which pertain directly or indirectly to commercial email, regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive.
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) restricts telemarketing and the use of automated telephone equipment. The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages and fax machines. It also applies to unsolicited text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services. Additionally, a number of states have enacted statutes that address telemarketing. For example, some states, such as California, Illinois and New York, have created do-not-call lists. Other states, such as Oregon and Washington, have enacted “no rebuttal statutes” that require the telemarketer to end the call when the consumer indicates that he or she is not interested in the product being sold. Restrictions on telephone marketing, including calls and text messages, are enforced by the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, states and through the availability of statutory damages and class action lawsuits for violations of the TCPA. 
The Restore Online Shopper Confidence Act (“ROSCA”), and similar state laws, impose requirements and restrictions on online services that automatically charge payment cards on a periodic basis to renew a subscription service, if the consumer does not cancel the service.
Laws and regulations related to the Program Participation Agreement of the U.S. Department of Education, which define the terms and conditions that an institution must meet to begin and continue participation in the Title IV federal student aid programs, and other similar laws regulate the recruitment of students to colleges and other institutions of higher learning.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) provides relief for claims of circumvention of copyright protected technologies and includes a safe harbor intended to reduce the liability of online service providers for hosting, listing or linking to third-party content that infringes copyrights of others.
The Communications Decency Act provides that online service providers will not be considered the publisher or speaker of content provided by others, such as individuals who post content on an online service provider’s website.

The Company is subject to certain laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply to not only third-party transactions, but also may impact transfers of personal information among the company and its affiliates. For example:
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), became effective on May 18, 2018. This European Union (“EU”) law governing data practices and privacy applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to certain of our products and services offered in the EU, and imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. 
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), became effective on January 1, 2020, with enforcement commencing on July 1, 2020. CCPA provides consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt out of sale of their personal information to third parties. It also expands the definition of personal information and gives consumers increased privacy rights and protections for that information. The CCPA also includes special requirements for California consumers under the age of 16.
The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) took effect on December 16, 2020, but most provisions of CPRA will not become operative until January 1, 2023. CPRA amends and adds to CCPA by strengthening rights of California consumers, further restricting business use of consumer personal information, and establishing a new government agency for enforcement.
The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), similar in scope to CCPA, will also go into effect on January 1, 2023. VCDPA is the second U.S. state-level consumer privacy law after CCPA, but unlike California, will not apply to employees and business contacts, nor provide for a private right of action. VCDPA also defines the “sale” of personal information narrowly, including only exchanges for monetary consideration. 
Colorado is the third state to enact a comprehensive data privacy statute, the Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”). CPA takes effect on July 1, 2023. Although similar in scope to VCDPA, CPA defines “sale” of personal information in the same manner as CCPA, which includes any exchange for monetary or any other valuable consideration. 
The fourth U.S. state privacy law to be enacted, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), is somewhat narrower in scope than other state privacy laws, and adopts the VCDPA’s definition of “sale” of personal information. UCPA goes into effect on December 31, 2023. 
On April 29, 2022, the Connecticut General Assembly advanced a bill that is likely to become the fifth state privacy law in the U.S. The Connecticut bill, which resembles UCPA, CPA and VCDPA, would take effect on July 1, 2023. In the absence of federal consumer privacy legislation, at least ten other U.S. states have active privacy legislation bills pending. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
Overview
As of April 30, 2022, we had approximately 4,600 domestic employees, of which approximately 3,000 were full-time and the remaining were regularly scheduled part-time employees, and approximately 270 full-time international employees. In addition, we employed approximately 7,200 temporary and seasonal domestic employees during peak periods during Fiscal 2022. Of our approximate 3,200 full-time employees, 2,620 work in our Retail Segment, 210 work in our Wholesale Segment, 340 work in our Digital Student Solutions Segment and 30 work in corporate support functions. Our employees are not represented by unions, except for 11 employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
Personnel recruitment and training
We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate quality employees. Our success depends on our ability to promote and recruit qualified corporate personnel, regional and store managers and full-time and part-time store employees. Regional managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new store managers, while store managers are responsible for the hiring and training of store employees. Many of our part-time retail store employees are students attending the colleges and universities we serve. To attract and retain motivated and talented people, we look for opportunities to promote from within the Company. 
We invest in our employees through structured training programs that offer all employees opportunities for development. We create, manage, or offer a large collection of courses for employees that cover a range of subjects such as goal setting, how to be an effective leader, situational leadership, and effective communication. 
Compensation and benefits 
We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to our employees. Corporate and store management, including store directors, regional managers and store managers, are compensated with base pay plus annual bonuses based on performance. We also offer equity awards to employees in several levels of management. Non-management employees are compensated on an hourly basis in addition to periodic contests and rewards. Many of our employees participate in one of our 
Index to Form 10-K Index to FS
various incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon department or Company performance. We also provide our eligible employees the opportunity to participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan which includes a 100% Company match of the employee’s elective contributions up to 4% of eligible compensation. We offer a competitive benefits package for eligible employees and an employee discount on merchandise purchased from our stores.
We also offer an employee assistance program that provides employees and their family members immediate support and guidance, including access to free short-term licensed counseling services, as well as assessments and referrals for further services. Employees have 24-hour access by phone and through an interactive website to find information and resources for hundreds of everyday work and life issues, search for clinicians, submit online service requests and participate in interactive, customizable self-improvement programs. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We are focused on creating an inclusive culture and a diverse employee base to better serve our diverse customer base. We provide programming to our employees on inclusion and diversity topics. Approximately, 64% of our full-time and part-time domestic employees identify as women and approximately 33% identify as ethnically diverse.
We have required all employees to complete training aimed at preventing harassment and discrimination and will be adding training in Fiscal 2023 regarding inclusion and diversity and unconscious bias. We have also created a D&I taskforce and engaged an outside consultant to evaluate current practices and impressions and assist us in educating employees on aspects of diversity and inclusion about which they may not have been aware. 
Safety
Employee safety is a top priority. We have developed policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented measures to protect our employees and our customers consistent with OSHA standards and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) guidelines such as temporary store closures, increased sanitization efforts at our stores, distribution centers and headquarters offices, limiting travel, physical distancing, adopting a mask policy for all customers and employees, and remote work arrangements for the majority of non-retail employees.
