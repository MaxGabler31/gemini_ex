ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. ("CorEnergy") was organized as a Maryland corporation and commenced operations on December 8, 2005. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Report"), the terms "we", "us", "our" and the "Company" refer to CorEnergy and its subsidiaries.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
CorEnergy primarily owns and seeks to own assets in the U.S. energy sector that perform utility-like functions, such as pipelines, storage terminals, rail terminals and gas and electric transmission and distribution assets. Our objective is to generate long-term contracted revenue from operators of our assets, primarily under triple-net participating leases without direct commodity price exposure. We believe our leadership team's energy and utility expertise provides CorEnergy with a competitive advantage to acquire, own and lease U.S. energy infrastructure assets in a tax-efficient, transparent and investor-friendly REIT. Our leadership team also utilizes a disciplined investment philosophy developed through an average of over 25 years of relevant industry experience.
We expect our leases to provide us with contracted base rent, plus participating rent based upon asset-specific criteria. The energy industry commonly employs contracts with participating features, and we provide exposure to both the risk and opportunity of utilization of our assets, which we believe is a hallmark of infrastructure assets of all types. Our participating triple-net leases require the operator to pay all expenses of the business including maintaining our assets in good working order. 
The majority of our assets leased to tenants under triple-net leases are dependent upon the tenants' exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves in the fields where our assets are located. These reserves are depleted over time, and therefore, may economically diminish the value of our assets over the period that the underlying reserves are exploited. Accordingly, we expect the contracted base rents under these leases, including fair market renewal rent expectations, to provide for a return-on-capital, as well as a return of our invested capital, over the life of the asset. The portion of rents we believe to constitute a return of our invested capital are utilized for debt repayment and/or are reserved for capital reinvestment activities in order to maintain our long-term earnings and dividend paying capacity. The return-on-capital is that portion of rents which are available for distribution to our stockholders through dividend payouts.
Base rents under our leases are structured on an estimated fair market value rent structure over the initial term, which includes assumptions related to the terminal value of our assets and expectations of tenant renewals. At the conclusion of the initial lease term, our leases often contain fair market value repurchase options or fair market rent renewal terms. These clauses also act as safeguards against our tenants pursuing activities which would undermine or degrade the value of our assets faster than the underlying reserves are depleted. Our participating rents are structured to provide exposure to the successful commercial activity of the tenant, and as such, also provide protection in the event that the economic life of our assets is reduced based on accelerated production by our tenants.
Our assets are predominately mission-critical to our customers, in that utilization of our assets is necessary for the business they seek to conduct and their rental payments are an essential operating expense. For example, our crude oil gathering system assets are necessary to the exploitation of upstream crude oil reserves, so the operators' lease of those assets is economically critical to their operations. Some of our assets are subject to rate regulation by FERC or state public utility commissions. Further, energy infrastructure assets are an essential and growing component of the U.S. economy that give us the opportunity to assist the capital expansion plans and meet the capital needs of various midstream and upstream participants.
We intend to distribute substantially all of our cash available for distribution, less prudent reserves, on a quarterly basis. We regularly assess our ability to pay and to grow our dividend to common stockholders. We target long-term revenue growth of 1-3 percent annually from existing contracts through inflation escalations and participating rents, and additional growth from acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any potential acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions. Our management contract includes incentive provisions, aligning our leadership team with our stockholders' interests in raising the dividend only if we believe the rate is sustainable. 
We believe these characteristics align CorEnergy with the attractive attributes of other globally listed infrastructure companies, including high barriers to entry and contracts with predictable revenue streams, while mitigating risks and volatility experienced by other companies engaged in the midstream energy sector.

Acquisition Strategies and Due Diligence
We primarily rely on our own analysis to determine whether to make an acquisition. In evaluating net lease transactions, we consider, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction:

• | Tenant/Borrower Evaluation – We evaluate each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as well as other factors that may be relevant to a particular acquisition. We seek opportunities in which we believe the tenant may have a stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been recognized by the market. In evaluating a possible investment, the creditworthiness of a tenant or borrower often will be balanced with the value of the underlying real estate, particularly if the underlying property is specifically suited to the needs of the tenant. Whether a prospective tenant or borrower is creditworthy will be determined by our management team and reviewed by the investment committee, as described below. Creditworthy does not necessarily mean "investment grade."


• | Importance to Tenant/Borrower Operations – We predominately will focus on properties that we believe are essential or important to the ongoing operations of the tenant and/or for the economic production of hydrocarbon resources, which would remain necessary to any owner of the assets. We believe that this type of property will provide a relatively low risk of loss in the case of a potential bankruptcy or abandonment scenario since a tenant/borrower is less likely to risk the loss of a critically important lease or property.


• | Diversification – We attempt to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, and geographic location within the U.S. or tenant/borrower industry. By diversifying, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular asset or geographic region within the U.S.


• | Lease Terms – Typically, the net leased properties we will acquire will be leased on a full recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, we often seek to include a clause in each lease that provides for increases in rent over the term of the lease. These increases are fixed or tied to increases in indices such as the CPI. In many cases the lease will also seek to provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant at the property, thereby providing exposure to the commercial activity of the tenant through features such as participating rent. Alternatively, a lease may provide for mandated rental increases on specific dates, and we may adopt other methods in the future.


• | Asset Evaluation – We review the physical condition of the property and assess the likelihood of replacing the rental payment stream if the tenant defaults. We also engage a third party to conduct, or require the seller to conduct, a preliminary examination, or Phase 1 assessment, of the site to determine the potential for contamination or similar environmental site assessments in an attempt to identify potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition.


• | Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value – We attempt to include provisions in the leases that we believe may help protect a real property asset from changes in the operating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may affect its ability to satisfy its obligations or reduce the value of the real property asset. Such provisions include requiring our consent to specified tenant activity, requiring the tenant to provide indemnification protections, and requiring the tenant to utilize good operating practices consistent with objective criteria. We seek to enhance the likelihood of a tenant's lease obligations being satisfied through a guaranty of obligations from the tenant's corporate parent or other entity or a letter of credit. In some circumstances, we may provide tenants with repurchase options on the leased property. We expect, in those situations that the option purchase price will generally be the greater of the contract purchase price or the fair market value of the property at the time the option is exercised.


• | Equity Enhancements – We may attempt to obtain equity enhancements in connection with transactions. These equity enhancements may involve warrants exercisable at a future time to purchase stock of the tenant or borrower or their parent. If warrants are obtained, and become exercisable, and if the value of the stock subsequently exceeds the exercise price of the warrant, equity enhancements can help achieve the goal of increasing investor returns.


• | Other Real Estate Related Assets – As other opportunities arise, we may also seek to expand the portfolio to include other types of real estate-related investments, in all cases within the energy infrastructure sector, such as:


• | equity investments in real properties that are not long-term net leased to a single-tenant and may include partially leased properties, undeveloped properties and properties subject to short-term net leases, among others;


• | mortgage loans secured by real properties including loans to our taxable REIT subsidiaries;


• | subordinated interests in first mortgage real estate loans, or B-notes;


• | mezzanine loans related to real estate, which are senior to the borrower's equity position but subordinated to other third-party financing;

Glossary of Defined Terms


• | other operating energy infrastructure assets; and


• | equity and debt securities (including preferred equity, limited partnership interests, trusts and other higher-yielding structured debt and equity investments) issued by companies that are engaged in real-estate-related businesses as defined by regulations promulgated under the Code, including other REITs.

Use of Taxable REIT Subsidiaries
We operate as a REIT and therefore are generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxes on the income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived through leasing fees and financing revenue from our REIT qualifying investments in energy infrastructure assets. However, even as a REIT, we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The use of TRSs enables us to own certain assets and engage in certain businesses while maintaining compliance with the REIT qualification requirements under the Code. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries, and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our TRSs to other subsidiaries, including qualified REIT subsidiaries. For example, through a series of reorganization events, and based on a favorable IRS private letter ruling received, Omega was converted from a TRS entity to a qualified REIT subsidiary in 2017. Refer to the "Omega Pipeline (Mowood, LLC)" section in Item 2 of this Report for additional details.
Regulatory and Environmental Matters
Our energy infrastructure assets and operations, as well as those of our tenants, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of public health and safety, zoning and land use, and pricing and other matters related to certain of our business operations. For a discussion of the current effects and potential future impacts of such regulations on our business and properties, see the discussion presented in Item 1A of this Report under the subheading "Risks Related to Our Investments in Real Estate and the U.S. Energy Infrastructure Sector." In particular, for a discussion of the current and potential future effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations, see the discussion titled "Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for distribution" within such section.
Financing Strategies
Consistent with our asset acquisition policies, we use leverage when available on terms we believe are favorable. The amount of leverage that we may employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. Although we currently do not anticipate doing so, the amount of total funded debt leverage we employ may exceed 50 percent of our total assets. Secured loans which we obtain, could be recourse or non-recourse to us. A lender on non-recourse mortgage debt often has recourse only to the property collateralizing such debt and not to any of our other assets, while full recourse financing would give the lender recourse to all of our assets. The use of non-recourse debt, helps us to limit the exposure of all of our assets to any one debt obligation. Lenders may, however, have recourse to our other assets in limited circumstances not related to the repayment of the indebtedness, such as under an environmental indemnity. We may have an unsecured line of credit that can be used in connection with refinancing existing debt and making new acquisitions, as well as to meet other working capital needs. We generally intend to incur debt which bears interest at fixed rates, or is effectively converted to fixed rates through interest rate caps or swap agreements.
Competition
We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks and commercial financing companies to make the types of investments that we plan to make in the U.S. energy infrastructure sector. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to a greater variety of funding sources than are available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. These competitive conditions may adversely affect our ability to make investments in the energy infrastructure sector and could adversely affect our distributions to stockholders.
MANAGEMENT
Our Manager
We are externally managed by Corridor. Corridor is a real property asset manager with a focus on U.S. energy infrastructure real property assets. Corridor assists us in identifying infrastructure real property asset acquisition opportunities, and is generally responsible for our day-to-day operations.

Corridor Team
Each of our officers is an employee of Corridor or one of its affiliates. Corridor is not obligated to dedicate certain of its employees exclusively to us, nor are it or its employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to our business. Following the resignation of Richard C. Green as a director and Chairman of the Board of the Company, effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Green continues to be involved in the management services that Corridor provides to the Company in his capacity as a Managing Director of Corridor. As described below, we pay a management fee and certain other fees to Corridor, which it uses in part to pay compensation to its officers and employees who, notwithstanding that some of them also are our officers, receive no cash compensation directly from us.
We pay Corridor a management fee based on total assets under management. Additionally, in aligning our strategy to focus on distributions and distribution growth, Corridor is paid an incentive fee based on increases in distributions to our stockholders. A percentage of the Corridor incentive fee is reinvested in CorEnergy's common stock. Pursuant to the Management Agreement and Administrative Agreement, Corridor has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to present us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment objectives and policies and is generally responsible, subject to the supervision and review of our Board of Directors, for our day-to-day operations.
Energy Infrastructure Real Property Asset Management
The Corridor team has experience across several segments of the energy sector and is primarily responsible for investigating, analyzing and selecting potential infrastructure asset acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions and transactions are submitted to our Board of Directors for final approval following a recommendation from the management team.
We believe that effective management of our assets is essential to maintain and enhance property values. Important aspects of asset management include meeting the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, refinancing debt, selling properties and knowledge of the bankruptcy process.
We monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our properties. Monitoring involves receiving assurances that each tenant has paid real estate taxes, assessments and other expenses relating to the properties it occupies and confirming that appropriate insurance coverage is being maintained by the tenant. We review financial statements of tenants and undertake regular physical inspections of the condition and maintenance of properties. In addition, we periodically analyze each tenant's financial condition and the industry in which each tenant operates.
Management Agreement
Under our Management Agreement, Corridor (i) presents us with suitable acquisition opportunities consistent with our investment policies and our objectives, (ii) is responsible for our day-to-day operations and (iii) performs such services and activities relating to our assets and operations as may be appropriate. The Management Agreement does not have a specific term, and will remain in place unless terminated by us or Corridor in the manner permitted pursuant to the agreement. 
The terms of the Management Agreement include a quarterly management fee equal to 0.25 percent (1.00 percent annualized) of the value of our Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter. For purposes of the Management Agreement, "Managed Assets" means our total assets (including any securities receivables, other personal property or real property purchased with or attributable to any borrowed funds) minus (A) the initial invested value of all non-controlling interests, (B) the value of any hedged derivative assets, (C) any prepaid expenses and (D) all of the accrued liabilities other than (1) deferred taxes and (2) debt entered into for the purpose of leverage. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, our securities portfolio will be valued at then-current market value. For purposes of the definition of Managed Assets, other personal property and real property assets will include real and other personal property owned and our assets invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate or personal property (including acquisition-related costs and acquisition costs that may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), valued at the aggregate historical cost, before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar noncash reserves.
The Management Agreement includes a quarterly incentive fee of 10 percent of the increase in distributions paid over a threshold distribution equal to $0.625 per share per quarter. The Management Agreement also requires at least half of any incentive fees to be reinvested in our common stock. Corridor received an incentive fee of $597 thousand during 2018.
Administrative Agreement
Under our Administrative Agreement, Corridor, as our administrator, performs (or oversees or arranges for the performance of) the administrative services necessary for our operation, including without limitation providing us with equipment, clerical,

bookkeeping and record keeping services. For these services we pay our administrator an annual fee equal to 0.04 percent of the value of the Company's Managed Assets as of the end of each quarter, with a minimum annual fee of $30 thousand.
Pursuant to the Management and Administrative Agreement, Corridor furnishes us with office facilities and clerical and administrative services necessary for our operation (other than services provided by our custodian, accounting agent, dividend and interest-paying agent and other service providers). Corridor is authorized to enter into agreements with third parties to provide such services. To the extent we request, Corridor will (i) oversee the performance and payment of the fees of our service providers and make such reports and recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning such matters as the parties deem desirable; (ii) respond to inquiries and otherwise assist such service providers in the preparation and filing of regulatory reports, proxy statements, and stockholder communications, and the preparation of materials and reports for the Board of Directors; (iii) establish and oversee the implementation of borrowing facilities or other forms of leverage authorized by the Board of Directors; and (iv) supervise any other aspect of our administration as may be agreed upon by us and Corridor. We have agreed, pursuant to the Management Agreement, to reimburse Corridor for all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the foregoing.
We bear all expenses not specifically assumed by Corridor and incurred in our operations. The compensation and allocable routine overhead expenses of all management professionals of Corridor and its staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing us management services, is provided and paid for by Corridor and not us.
