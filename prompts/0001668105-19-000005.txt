 The amount of data available for decision making is increasing dramatically, and the technology to analyze and act on that data is becoming more capable and ubiquitous. The growing capabilities of cloud data warehouses have created a powerful and easy-to-use alternative to on-premise infrastructure that is accelerating the shift of data to the cloud and expanding the availability of big data and machine learning technologies to organizations of all sizes. At the same time, the increasing pace of business is driving the need for more real-time data processing and the need to make data-driven decisions throughout organizations, creating demand for self-service business and analytical applications. Data infrastructure has begun to shift to cloud platforms to enhance agility, elasticity, scalability, and time-to-value. As a result, organizations require agile, real-time data integration and integrity solutions that support their evolving needs.
 Talend Data Fabric provides a comprehensive, flexible solution to address IT integration needs across industries. It works seamlessly across on-premise and cloud environments to connect both traditional and big data environments. Organizations can quickly integrate all forms of data across systems and applications at scale, with significantly improved performance and lower total cost of ownership than traditional data integration approaches. Talend Data Fabric interoperates and natively integrates with cloud data platforms such as Amazon AWS, Azure, Google, and Databricks, while including extensive support for cloud data warehouses such as Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure Data Warehouse, Google BigQuery, and Snowflake. Our flexible architecture enables us to rapidly adopt new technologies as they emerge and support evolving cloud environments so that our customers can maximize the value of their data investments. Our technology allows our customers to manage both batch and real-time data processing and incorporate machine learning to leverage data for the automation of operational workflows. Our flexible cloud architecture allows organizations to operate in a cloud-based environment, in their on-premise datacenter, in private clouds, or in any hybrid combination.
 Industry Overview
     We are in the early stages of four disruptive trends that are reshaping the IT industry:
     The amount and availability of data is increasing significantly;
     Cloud platforms from Amazon, Google and Microsoft are increasing IT agility and expanding the accessibility of enterprise-grade technologies for organizations of all sizes;
     Big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL are dramatically lowering the cost to store and manage data and add new real-time processing capabilities across public and private cloud environments as well as on-premise deployments; and
     Changes in buying behavior favor frictionless sales and consumption-based pricing which enable faster access to data than ever before for a broader population of both IT and business users.

 These trends are creating an increasing number of new opportunities for organizations to be data driven. It is now, more than ever, critical for organizations to have an IT strategy that enables them to leverage data to support their business initiatives. To do this, IT teams must be able to work with new data platforms and fluidly address high volume, IoT, self-service and real-time scenarios.
     The Data-Driven Imperative
     The growing adoption of cloud-based IT infrastructure, proliferation of mobile and IoT devices, and accessibility of business applications is producing massive quantities of new data for organizations. This data provides little insight when stored in organizational or technology silos, but becomes highly valuable when combined with existing customer, product and partner data.
     The proliferation of digital information provides new opportunities for organizations to leverage data to enhance their business, making its effective and strategic use a key competitive advantage. As leading organizations move the competitive bar upwards with innovative uses of data, other organizations risk falling behind if they do not also invest in solutions that leverage their data assets effectively. In a business environment where data is available and actionable, data-driven decision making is now a competitive necessity.
     Cloud Adoption Becomes Mainstream
     IT infrastructure is undergoing a shift as organizations extend their infrastructure with cloud-based solutions. The traditional information technology framework of standalone hardware running on-premise software, which is deployed and maintained by IT departments, is shifting rapidly toward a virtualized, cloud-based infrastructure that reduces upfront investment, ongoing maintenance and support costs, and increases agility. Increasingly, companies are shifting their data infrastructure to the cloud. 
     This new IT paradigm empowers organizations to adapt their compute and storage resources to meet their needs in real time, reducing their footprint and streamlining costs.
     Generational Shift to New Data Technologies
     Technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, Spark Streaming, and NoSQL enable organizations to manage and process far greater amounts of data in real time and at significantly lower costs. These big data technologies support cloud platforms such as Amazon Elastic MapReduce, Microsoft Azure HD Insight, and Google Cloud Dataproc or Dataflow. These new technologies initially start as complementing the traditional relational database technology in widespread use today by adding new capabilities to deal with the far larger data volumes, more varied types of data, and real-time processing.
     Organizations will operate in a hybrid, multi-cloud mode for years to come where new projects are increasingly built with next-generation big data technologies and deployed in cloud environments, and existing applications will continue to run on traditional databases.

Demand for Self-Service Technology
     The proliferation of data, coupled with its strategic importance, has significantly increased business users’ demand for tools to access the data themselves. These tools are often limited by the data they can access. Data and analytics teams struggle to respond to this urgent need due to their over-reliance on IT-centric tools for finding, cataloging and transforming relevant data, and making it accessible to the growing number of distributed users in the enterprise, both inside and outside of centralized data and analytics teams. Due to this, organizations report that they spend more than 60% of their time in data preparation, leaving little time for actual analysis. This has led to demand for a new wave of self-service tools that allow both IT and business users to collect, govern, transform, and share data more quickly than before. 
     Data science teams, in particular, are dramatically retooling the analytics workflow. Much of their activities are only possible in the cloud, with spin up/down Spark clusters for data processing, including deep learning and machine learning capabilities required by data science projects. Data scientists are driving demand for data catalogs, which automatically discover data and provide lineage and other useful information about the data. Other aspects of the data science/machine learning workflow are coming into focus to enable an end-to-end process from raw data through machine learning models operating in production.
     Analytics and data teams rely on Data Engineers to automate and improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of data analytics. The skillset and needs of these engineers require much more self-service tools and a mix of coding, scripting, and more traditional data integration tools.
     Our Opportunity
     We believe our apps address the markets for Data Integration and Integrity Software, Master Data Management, and Integration and Orchestration Middleware, which IDC estimates combined were $17 billion in 2016 and are forecasted to reach $23 billion in 2020. IDC forecasts the data integration and integrity market to grow from $6.0 billion in 2017 to $9.8 billion in 2022. We believe that these markets will further expand as a portion of spend on hand-coded integrations will transition to software-based integration solutions given the time consuming and expensive process of manual integrations coupled with the scarcity of personnel with the requisite technical skills.
     The transformative change in IT infrastructure is driving a dramatic shift to cloud platforms to address infrastructure and data warehousing needs. This is driving rapid growth in cloud integration. According to IDC, the market for Cloud Data Integration and Integrity Software is forecast to reach $2.3 billion by 2022, representing a 30% CAGR from 2018. This significant growth rates represent the rapid expansion and pace of change in the markets underlying our opportunity.

     Backlog
     Backlog represents the consideration amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from contracts with customers that we believe to be firm and are in progress. Backlog is a measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles and may not be indicative of future operating results. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to methodologies used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts. The timing of our invoices to our customers is a negotiated term and thus varies among our support subscription agreements. For multi-year agreements, it is common for us to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenue, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. The change in backlog that results from changes in the average non-cancelable term of our support subscription arrangements may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or expected future revenue and therefore we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally and do not believe that it is a meaningful measurement of our future revenue. The backlog values we disclose include anticipated revenues associated with: (1) the original contract amounts; (2) change to the term of the contract for which we have received written confirmations from the applicable customers; and (3) change to the term of the contract for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business. Our total backlog was $20.3 million and $32.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Of the December 31, 2018 backlog, we expect to recognize revenue of $9.0 million in 2019 and $23.1 million thereafter.      Competition
     The market for our apps is highly competitive, quickly evolving and subject to rapid changes in technology, which may expand the alternatives available to our customers for their data integration and integrity requirements. Our current primary competitors generally fall into four categories:
     Diversified technology companies that offer data integration solutions, including: IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP;
     Pure-play data integration vendors, including: Ab Initio, Informatica and Tibco;
     Early-stage, niche data integration technologies; and
     Hand-coded, custom data integration solutions built internally by organizations that we target as potential customers.
     We believe that we are well-positioned in the marketplace relative to our competitors. We are differentiated from traditional vendors by our advanced technology and rapid innovation, both of which are driven by our open source apps and emerging niche vendors cannot match the scale of our app breadth or go-to-market capabilities.
     Many of our existing competitors have and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:
     Greater name recognition and longer operating histories;
     Larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
     Broader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers;
     Greater customer support resources;
     Greater resources to make acquisitions;

 
  11

 

     Lower labor and development costs;
     Larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and
     Substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.
     We expect competition to increase as other established and emerging companies enter the data integration software market, as customer requirements evolve and as new products and technologies are introduced. We believe that the principal factors that drive our competitive edge in our market include:
     App features, architecture reliability, performance and effectiveness;
     Name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering;
     Vision for the market and app roadmap, as well as pace of innovation;
     Interoperability with numerous cloud and big data solutions vendors;
     Integration with leading cloud and on-premise systems;
     Automation capabilities;
     Ability to adapt development, sales and marketing to the open source software model;
     Strength of sales and marketing efforts;
     Strategic partnerships with major enterprise software and infrastructure providers;
     Quality of support;
     Demonstrated return on investment through time-to-value and total cost of ownership; and
     Ease-of-use and efficiency during deployment.
     Intellectual Property
     We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, contractual restrictions and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We generally require our employees and consultants to execute invention assignment agreements with us that protect our intellectual property rights.
     Intellectual property laws, together with our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of France and the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology. Further, agreements with our employees and consultants may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies to redress any breach. Further, to the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
     As of December 31, 2018, we had two pending patent applications and no issued patents. We own and use registered and unregistered trademarks on or in connection with our apps and services in numerous jurisdictions. In addition, we have also registered numerous internet domain names.
