Item 1. Business
GENERAL

Fellazo Corp. (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 28, 2014.

The Company’s core business is “Healthcare and Personal Wellness” products - primarily bird-nest based, which include manufacturing and retail (retail chain and online). With our expertise in online applications platforms, we will be developing an online network platform to market and sell our products. and also create a system to source and purchase raw materials we required.

In mid of October 2019, the Company’s 49% subsidiary Fellazo Berhad (“FB”) started purchases of raw bird-nests directly from bird-nest farmers or their agents, and re-sold them to bird-nest processors; wherever possible these raw bird-nests are delivered directly from the farmer to the processor, so that we would not have to maintain a facility to store these raw bird-nests at an early stage of our business development.

FB’s show factory had since moved to a new location after our Head-Office moved to Putrajaya, the Malaysian Government’s Federal Administrative Center. The new show factory is located within half an hour from our office and continues to be managed by our Management Agent, Swipypay Berhad.

Due to the continuous effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy uncertainty, we are minimally operating and any plan for expansion had been put on hold until the overall economic climate improves.

On April 1, 2021, Yap Kit Chuan, President, director and owner of ninety-six percent (96%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, agreed to transfer, to a number of business associates, up to approximately 26,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, representing thirty percent (30%) of the total issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.

On July 15, 2021, Yap Kit Chuan, agreed to increase the proposed transfers up to a total of 35,000,000 shares, representing up to forty-one percent (41%) of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock.  The transfers will occur from time to time and will now be completed on or before August 31, 2021. The transfers will be undertaken pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, and the shares transferred will continue to carry a restrictive legend.

As of August 31, 2021, the total of 34,835,373 shares have been transferred to 249 new and 9 existing shareholders, and the number of shares belonged to Yap Kit Chuan was 48,368,127 shares.

Our office is located at T2-L8-3, Level 8, IOI City Tower Two, Lebuh IRC, IOI Resort City, 62502 Putrajaya, Malaysia. Our corporate website is http://fellazo.com.

We have never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

Our Company’s main core products during the next accounting year are expected to be the following, and these would depend heavily on the economy recovery from effects of the pandemic.

(a) | Raw bird-nests - FB will purchase raw bird-nests from bird-nest farmers locally in Malaysia, but we are also seeking sources from nearby countries in South East Asia, such as Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and others. This initial plan is also to create a network of consistent supplies of raw bird-nests. The raw bird-nests will then be sold to bird-nest processing factories and for use at our show-factory located at our premise.

(b) | Clean bird-nests - we have made arrangements with small-holder bird-nest processing factories to supply them with raw bird-nests, who will then sell all the same finished clean products to us. This will ensure we have a constant supply of clean bird-nests. 
 | The clean bird-nests will be packed in different packages in according to volume and grades for stock-up and sale at our retail outlet on our premise. 
(c) | OEM personal cleansing and nourishing facial products under the brand name of “Yanduopin (YDP)” - which name means “Multiple Bird Nest Product” – we are still in the process of testing and performing consumer surveys on our personal cleansing and nourishing facial products.

SEASONALITY

Our products are not influenced by seasonality.

COMPETITION

The bird-nest industry is becoming a very competitive market, and increasingly popular due to the huge consumer market in China. There are a number of companies, especially in Malaysia, who are venturing into the bird-nest and bird-nest related products’ market.

Because competition for raw bird-nest is very high, so it is essential to establish a network of suppliers to ensure consistent supplies. Our company is considering options to acquire our own bird-nesting houses to ensure consistent and quality supplies.
