Item 1.  Business
General
Valaris Limited is a global offshore contract drilling company. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Valaris," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Valaris Limited together with all its subsidiaries and predecessors.
We are a leading provider of offshore contract drilling services to the international oil and gas industry. We currently own an offshore drilling rig fleet of 56 rigs, with drilling operations in almost every major offshore market across six continents. Our rig fleet includes 11 drillships, four dynamically positioned semisubmersible rigs, one moored semisubmersible rig, 40 jackup rigs and a 50% equity interest in Saudi Aramco Rowan Offshore Drilling Company ("ARO"), our 50/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco, which owns an additional seven rigs. We operate the world's largest fleet amongst competitive rigs, including one of the newest ultra-deepwater fleets in the industry and a leading premium jackup fleet. 
Our customers include many of the leading national and international oil companies, in addition to many independent operators. We are among the most geographically diverse offshore drilling companies, with current operations spanning 14 countries. The markets in which we operate include the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, the Middle East, West Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia.
We provide drilling services on a day rate contract basis. Under day rate contracts, we provide an integrated service that includes the provision of a drilling rig and rig crews for which we receive a daily rate that may vary between the full rate and zero rate throughout the duration of the contractual term, depending on the operations of the rig. We also may receive lump-sum fees or similar compensation for the mobilization, demobilization and capital upgrades of our rigs. Our customers bear substantially all of the costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well.
As we entered 2020, we expected the volatility that began with the oil price decline in 2014 to continue over the near-term with the expectation that long-term oil prices would remain at levels sufficient to support a continued gradual recovery in the demand for offshore drilling services. We were focused on opportunities to put our rigs to work, manage liquidity, extend our financial runway, and reduce debt as we sought to navigate the extended market downturn and improve our balance sheet. Recognizing our ability to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to meet our financial obligations depended upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control, we had significant financial flexibility within our capital structure to support our liability management efforts. However, starting in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the response thereto negatively impacted the macro-economic environment and global economy. Global oil demand fell sharply at the same time global oil supply increased as a result of certain oil producers competing for market share, leading to a supply glut. As a consequence, the price of Brent crude oil fell from around $60 per barrel at year-end 2019 to around $20 per barrel in mid-April 2020. In response to dramatically reduced oil price expectations, our customers reviewed, and in most cases lowered significantly, their capital expenditure plans in light of revised pricing expectations. This caused our customers, primarily in the second and third quarters of 2020, to cancel or shorten the duration of many of our drilling contracts, cancel future drilling programs and seek pricing and other contract concessions which led to material operating losses and liquidity constraints for us. 
In 2020, the combined effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the significant decline in the demand for oil and the substantial surplus in the supply of oil resulted in significantly reduced demand and day rates for offshore drilling provided by the Company and increased uncertainty regarding long-term market conditions. These events had a significant adverse impact on our current and expected liquidity position and financial runway and led to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases (as defined herein).
In 2021, Brent crude oil prices increased from approximately $50 per barrel at the beginning of 2021 to nearly $80 per barrel by the end of the year and have subsequently increased to over $90 per barrel in early 2022. Increased oil prices are due to, among other factors, rebounding demand for hydrocarbons, a measured approach to production increases by OPEC+ members and a focus on cash flow and returns by major exploration and production companies. The constructive oil price environment led to an improvement in contracting and tendering activity in 2021 as compared to 2020. Benign floater rig years awarded in 2021 were more than double the amount awarded in 2020. This increase in activity is particularly evident for drillships with several multi-year contracts awarded and a meaningful improvement in day rates for this class of assets. Jackup contracting activity also increased in 2021, but at a more modest pace than for floaters; however, demand for jackups did not decline as significantly in 2020 as it did for floaters. While the near-term outlook for the offshore drilling industry has improved, particularly for floaters, since the beginning of 2021, the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic remains uneven, and there is still uncertainty around the sustainability of the improvement in oil prices and the recovery in demand for offshore drilling services.
Additionally, the full impact that the pandemic and the volatility of oil prices will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows is uncertain due to numerous factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of the ongoing vaccine rollout, the general resumption of global economic activity along with the injection of substantial government monetary and fiscal stimulus and the sustainability of the improvements in oil prices and demand in the face of market volatility. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited operational downtime. Our rigs have had to shut down operations while crews are tested and incremental sanitation protocols are implemented and while crew changes have been restricted as replacement crews are quarantined. We continue to incur additional personnel, housing and logistics costs in order to mitigate the potential impacts of COVID-19 to our operations. In limited instances, we have been reimbursed for these costs by our customers. Our operations and business may be subject to further economic disruptions as a result of the spread of COVID-19 among our workforce, the extension or imposition of further public health measures affecting supply chain and logistics, and the impact of the pandemic on key customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. There can be no assurance that these, or other issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, will not materially affect our ability to operate our rigs in the future. 
Chapter 11 Proceedings and Emergence from Chapter 11
On August 19, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), Valaris plc (“Legacy Valaris” or “Predecessor”) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court under the caption In re Valaris plc, et al., Case No. 20-34114 (MI) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). On March 3, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors' chapter 11 plan of reorganization. 
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, on and prior to April 30, 2021 (the "Effective Date"), Legacy Valaris effectuated certain restructuring transactions, pursuant to which the successor company, Valaris, was formed and through a series of transactions Legacy Valaris transferred to a subsidiary of Valaris substantially all of the subsidiaries, and other assets, of Legacy Valaris.
On the Effective Date, we successfully completed our financial restructuring and together with the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we eliminated $7.1 billion of debt and obtained a $520 million capital injection by issuing the first lien secured notes (the "First Lien Notes"). See “Note 9 - Debt" for additional information on the First Lien Notes. On the Effective Date, the Legacy Valaris Class A ordinary shares were cancelled and common shares of Valaris with a nominal value of $0.01 per share (the “Common Shares”) were issued. Also, former holders of Legacy Valaris' equity were issued warrants (the "Warrants") to purchase Common Shares.
See “Note 2 – Chapter 11 Proceedings” and "Note 3 - Fresh Start Accounting" to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional details regarding the reorganization, Chapter 11 Cases and related items.
Contract Drilling Operations
Our business consists of four operating segments: (1) Floaters, which included our drillships and semisubmersible rigs, (2) Jackups, (3) ARO and (4) Other, which consists of management services on rigs owned by third-parties and the activities associated with our arrangements with ARO. Floaters, Jackups and ARO are also reportable segments.
We own and operate 56 rigs, 26 are located in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, 12 are located in North and South America and 18 are located in Europe as of December 31, 2021.
Our drilling rigs drill and complete oil and natural gas wells. From time to time, our drilling rigs may be utilized as accommodation units or for non-drilling services, such as workovers and interventions, plug and abandonment and decommissioning work. Demand for our drilling services is based upon many factors beyond our control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - The success of our business largely depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which can be significantly affected by volatile oil and natural gas prices.”
Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiations with our customers, and most contracts are awarded upon competitive bidding. The terms of our drilling contracts can vary significantly, but generally contain the following commercial terms:
•contract duration or term for a specific period of time or a period necessary to drill one or more wells, 
•term extension options, exercisable by our customers, upon advance notice to us, at mutually agreed, indexed, fixed rates or current rate at the date of extension, 
•provisions permitting early termination of the contract (1) if the rig is lost or destroyed, (2) if operations are suspended for a specified period of time due to various events, including damage or breakdown of major rig equipment, unsatisfactory performance, or "force majeure" events (3) failure of the customer to receive final investment decision (FID) with respect to projects for which the drilling rig was contracted; or (4) at the convenience (without cause) of the customer, exercisable upon advance notice to us, and in in certain cases without making an early termination payment to us,
•payment of compensation to us is (generally in U.S. dollars although some contracts require a portion of the compensation to be paid in local currency) on a day rate basis such that we receive a fixed amount for each day that the drilling rig is under contract (lower day rates generally apply for limited periods when operations are suspended due to various events, including during delays that are beyond our reasonable control, during repair of equipment damage or breakdown and during periods of re-drilling damaged portions of the well, and no day rate, or zero rate, generally applies when these limited periods are exceeded until the event is remediated, and during periods to remediate unsatisfactory performance or other specified conditions), 
•payment by us of the operating expenses of the drilling rig, including crew labor and incidental rig supply and maintenance costs, 
•mobilization and demobilization requirements of us to move the drilling rig to and from the planned drilling site, and may include reimbursement of all or a portion of these moving costs by the customer in the form of an up-front payment, additional day rate over the contract term or direct reimbursement, and
•provisions allowing us to recover certain labor and other operating cost increases, including certain cost increases due to changes in applicable law, from our customers through day rate adjustment or direct reimbursement.    
In general, in a downturn in offshore drilling demand, contract awards are subject to an extremely competitive bidding process. The intense pressure on operating day rates could result in lower margin contracts that also contain less favorable contractual and commercial terms, including reduced or no mobilization and/or demobilization fees; reduced day rates or zero day rates during downtime due to damage or failure of our equipment; reduced standby, redrill and moving rates and reduced periods in which such rates are payable; reduced caps on reimbursements for lost or damaged downhole tools; reduced periods to remediate downtime due to equipment breakdowns or failure to perform in accordance with the contractual standards of performance before the operator may terminate the contract; certain limitations on our ability to be indemnified from operator and third- party damages caused by our fault, resulting in increases in the nature and amounts of liability allocated to us; and reduced or no early termination fees and/or termination notice periods.
Backlog Information
See "Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for discussion on backlog information. 
Drilling Contracts and Insurance Program
Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of allocation of responsibility for liability between our customer and us for loss or damage to each party's property and third-party property, personal injuries and other claims arising out of our drilling operations. We also maintain insurance for these exposures to personal injuries, damage to or loss of property and certain business risks. 
Our insurance program provides coverage, subject to the policies' terms and conditions and to the extent not otherwise assumed by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling contract, for third-party liability claims arising from our operations. Our insurance program provides coverage that is customary for our industry. Generally, our insurance program provides third-party liability coverage up to $750.0 million. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer in excess of, and for risks not covered by, our insurance coverage.
Well-control events generally include an unintended release from a well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site, such as a blowout preventer, by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production facilities. Our customers typically indemnify us for well-control events.
Our insurance program also provides hull and machinery coverage to us for physical damage (including total loss) to our rigs, cargo and equipment, excluding damage arising from a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, we retain the risk for windstorm damage to our drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We do not currently carry insurance for loss of hire. Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs.
Our drilling contracts customarily provide that each party is responsible for injuries or death to their respective personnel and loss or damage to their respective property (including the personnel and property of each parties’ contractors and subcontractors) regardless of the cause of the loss or damage. However, in certain drilling contracts our customer’s responsibility for damage to its property and the property of its other contractors contains an exception to the extent the loss or damage is due to our negligence, which exception is usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence basis, although in some cases we assume responsibility for all damages due to our negligence.  In addition, our drilling contracts typically provide for our customers to indemnify us, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation, for loss or damage to our down-hole equipment, and in some cases for a limited amount of the repair of or replacement cost of our subsea equipment, unless the damage is caused by our negligence, normal wear and tear or defects in our equipment.
Subject to the exceptions noted below, our customers typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination arising from operations, including as a result of blowouts, cratering and seepage, when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including costs for clean-up and removal of pollution and third-party damages. In most drilling contracts, we assume liability for third-party damages resulting from such pollution and contamination caused by our negligence, usually subject to negotiated caps on a per occurrence or per event basis. In addition, in substantially all of our contracts, the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the reservoir, for loss of hydrocarbons escaping from the reservoir and for the costs of bringing the well under control. Further, subject to the exceptions noted below, most of our contracts provide that the customer assumes responsibility and indemnifies us for loss or damage to the well, except when the loss or damage to the well is due to our negligence, in which case most of our contracts provide that the customer's sole remedy is to require us to redrill the lost or damaged portion of the well at a substantially reduced rate and, in some cases, pay for some of the costs to repair the well.
Most of our drilling contracts incorporate a broad exclusion that limits the operator's indemnity for damages and losses resulting from our gross negligence and willful misconduct and for fines and penalties and punitive damages levied or assessed directly against us. This exclusion overrides other provisions in the contract that would otherwise limit our liability for ordinary negligence. In most of these cases, we are still able to negotiate a liability cap (although these caps are significantly higher than the caps we are able to negotiate for ordinary negligence) on our exposure for losses or damages resulting from our gross negligence. In certain cases, the broad exclusion only applies to losses or damages resulting from the gross negligence of our senior supervisory personnel. However, in some cases we have contractually assumed significantly increased exposure or unlimited exposure for losses and damages due to the gross negligence of some or all our personnel, and in most cases, we are not able to contractually limit our exposure for our willful misconduct. 
Notwithstanding our negotiation of express limitations in our drilling contracts for losses or damages resulting from our ordinary negligence and any express limitations (albeit usually much higher) for losses or damages in the event of our gross negligence, under the applicable laws that govern certain of our drilling contracts, the courts will not enforce any indemnity for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result, under the laws of such jurisdictions, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts that would otherwise limit our liability in the event of our gross negligence or willful misconduct are deemed to be unenforceable as being contrary to public policy, and we are exposed to unlimited liability for losses and damages that result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct, regardless of any express limitation of our liability in the relevant drilling contracts. Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, an indemnity from an operator for losses or damages of third-parties resulting from our gross negligence is enforceable, but an indemnity for losses or damages of the operator is not enforceable. In such cases, the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us would be enforceable with respect to third-party claims for losses of damages, such as may arise in pollution claims, but the contractual indemnity obligation of the operator to us with respect to injury or death to the operator's personnel and the operator’s damages to the well, to the reservoir and for the costs of well control would not be enforceable. Furthermore, although there is a lack of precedential authority for these types of claims in countries where the civil law is applied, in those situations where a fault based codified civil law system is applicable to our drilling contracts, as opposed to the common law system, the courts generally will not enforce a contractual indemnity clause that totally indemnifies us from losses or damages due to our gross negligence but may enforce the contractual indemnity over and above a cap on our liability for gross negligence, assuming the cap requires us to accept a significant amount of liability.
Similar to gross negligence, regardless of any express limitations in a drilling contract regarding our liability for fines and penalties and punitive damages, the laws of most jurisdictions will not enforce an indemnity that indemnifies a party for a fine or penalty that is levied or punitive damages arising from willful misconduct that are assessed directly against such party on the ground that it is against public policy to indemnify a party from a fine, loss, penalty or punitive damages, especially where the purpose of such levy or assessment is to deter the behavior that resulted in the fine, loss or penalty or punish such party for the behavior that warranted the assessment of punitive damages. 
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. In addition, our drilling contracts are individually negotiated, and the degree of indemnification we receive from operators against the liabilities discussed above can vary from contract to contract based on market conditions and customer requirements existing when the contract was negotiated and the interpretation and enforcement of applicable law when the claim is adjudicated. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a customer, there can be no assurance that our customers will be financially able to indemnify us or will otherwise honor a contractual indemnity obligation that is enforceable under applicable law. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. 
In certain cases, vendors who provide equipment or services to us limit their pollution liability to a specific monetary cap, and we assume the liability above that cap. Typically, in the case of original equipment manufacturers, the cap is a negotiated amount based on mutual agreement of the parties considering the risk profiles and thresholds of each party. However, for smaller vendors, the liability is usually limited to the value, or double the value, of the contract.
We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of waste oil, fuels, lubricants, motor oils, pipe dope, paint, solvents, ballast, bilge, garbage, debris, sewage, hazardous waste and other liquids, the discharge of which originates from our rigs or equipment above the surface of the water and in some cases from our subsea equipment. Our contracts generally provide that, in the event of any such spill from our rigs, we are responsible for fines and penalties.
Major Customers
We provide our contract drilling services to major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies. During the eight months ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), our five largest customers accounted for 42% of consolidated revenues. BP, our only customer who accounts for 10% or more of consolidated revenues, accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues. During the four months ended April 30, 2021 (Predecessor), our five largest customers accounted for 45% of consolidated revenues. BP, our only customer who accounts for 10% or more of consolidated revenues, accounted for 14% of consolidated revenues. 
Competition
The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Drilling contracts are, for the most part, awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is often the primary factor in determining which contractor is awarded a contract, although quality of service, operational and safety performance, equipment suitability and availability, location of equipment, reputation and technical expertise also are factors.  There are numerous competitors with significant resources in the offshore contract drilling industry.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our operations are affected by political initiatives and by laws and regulations that relate to the oil and gas industry, including laws and regulations that have or may impose increased financial responsibility and oil spill abatement contingency plan capability requirements. Accordingly, we will be directly affected by the approval and adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas for economic, environmental, safety or other policy reasons. It is also possible that these laws and regulations and political initiatives could adversely affect our operations in the future by significantly increasing our operating costs or restricting areas open for drilling activity.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Increasing regulatory complexity could adversely impact the costs associated with our offshore drilling operations."
Our operations are subject to laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, pollution, contamination and hazardous waste disposal or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
•require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
•require notice to stakeholders of proposed and ongoing operations;
•require the installation of expensive pollution control equipment; 
•restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling; and
•restrict the production rate of natural resources below the rate that would otherwise be possible.
Environmental laws and regulations specifically applicable to our business activities could impose significant liability on us for damages, clean-up costs, fines and penalties in the event of oil spills or similar discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of our operations, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance or for which indemnity is prohibited by applicable law and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. To date, such laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results.  However, the legislative, judicial and regulatory response to any well-control incidents could substantially increase our customers' liabilities in respect of oil spills and also could increase our liabilities. In addition to potential increased liabilities, such legislative, judicial or regulatory action could impose increased financial, insurance or other requirements that may adversely impact the entire offshore drilling industry.
Additionally, environmental laws and regulations are revised frequently, and any changes, including changes in implementation or interpretation of existing laws/regulations, that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for our industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992, the U.K. Merchant Shipping Act 1995, Marpol 73/78 (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), the U.K. Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998, as amended, and other related legislation and regulations and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA 90"), as amended, the Clean Water Act and other U.S. federal statutes applicable to us and our operations, as well as similar statutes in Texas, Louisiana, other coastal states and other non-U.S. jurisdictions, address oil spill prevention, reporting and control and have significantly expanded potential liability, fine and penalty exposure across many segments of the oil and gas industry. Such statutes and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills, disposal of waste and liability for resulting damages. For instance, OPA 90 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs as well as a variety of fines, penalties and damages. Similar environmental laws apply in our other areas of operation. Failure to comply with these statutes and regulations may subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, which may not be covered by contractual indemnification or insurance, or for which indemnity is prohibited under applicable law, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.
High-profile and catastrophic events such as the 2010 Macondo well incident have heightened governmental and environmental concerns about the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas.  We are adversely affected by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits and restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that have and may further impact our operations. 
As a result of the 2010 Macondo well incident, the United States Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issued a drilling safety rule in 2012 that included requirements for the cementing of wells, well-control barriers, blowout preventers, well-control fluids, well completions, workovers and decommissioning operations. BSEE also issued regulations requiring operators to have safety and environmental management 
systems ("SEMS") prior to conducting operations and requiring operators and contractors to agree on how the contractors will assist the operators in complying with the SEMS. In addition, in August 2012, BSEE issued an Interim Policy Document ("IPD") stating that it would begin issuing Incidents of Non-Compliance to contractors as well as operators for serious violations of BSEE regulations. Following federal court decisions successfully challenging the scope of BSEE’s jurisdiction over offshore contractors, this IPD has been removed from the list of IPDs on the BSEE website. If this judicial precedent stands, it may reduce regulatory and civil litigation liability exposures.
On July 28, 2016, BSEE adopted the 2016 Well Control Rule. This rule included more stringent design requirements for well-control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. Subsequently, on May 2, 2019, BSEE issued the 2019 Well Control Rule, the revised well control and blowout preventer rule governing the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) activities. The rule revised existing regulations impacting offshore oil and gas drilling, completions, workovers and decommissioning activities. Specifically, the 2019 Well Control Rule addresses six areas of offshore operations: well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring and subsea containment. The revisions were targeted to ensure safety and environmental protection while correcting errors in the 2016 rule and reducing unnecessary regulatory burden. We have not incurred significant costs to comply with the 2016 Well Control Rule or 2019 Well Control Rule.
The continuing and evolving threat of cyber attacks will likely require increased expenditures to strengthen cyber risk management systems for drilling rigs and onshore facilities. For example, on May 11, 2017, an executive order was issued entitled Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure, which is intended to improve the nation's ability to defend against increasing and evolving cyber attacks, and in July 2017 the USCG issued proposed cybersecurity guidelines for port facilities and offshore facilities, including drilling rigs, that could be impacted by cyber attacks. We cannot currently estimate the future expenditures associated with increased regulatory requirements, which may be material, and we continue to monitor regulatory changes as they occur.
Additionally, climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators, and significant focus is being put on companies that are active producers of hydrocarbon resources. Globally, there are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals at various levels of government to address the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, such as laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources such as wind power and solar energy and programs to mandate or incentivize the conversion from internal combustion engine powered vehicles to electric-powered vehicles. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming oil, and thereby reduce demand for oil, which could reduce our customers’ demand for our services. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could have an adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows. 
Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement in November 2020, the United States officially reentered the agreement in February 2021. Further, in November 2021, the Unites States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy. It is likely that new executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, restricting, or delaying oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated. For example, multiple executive orders pertaining to environmental regulations and climate change have recently been issued, including the (1) Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis and (2) Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad. The latter executive order announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices, established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration and affirmed that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before mid-century is a critical priority. In June 2021, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction 
against the pause of oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters while litigation challenging that aspect of the executive order is ongoing. On January 27, 2022, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s failure to calculate the potential emissions from foreign oil consumption violated the agency’s approval of oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico under the National Environmental Policy Act. The full impact of these federal actions, or any other future restrictions or prohibitions, remains unclear.
If new laws are enacted or other government actions are taken that restrict or prohibit offshore drilling in our principal areas of operation, impose additional regulatory (including environmental protection) requirements that materially increase the liabilities, financial requirements or operating or equipment costs associated with offshore drilling, exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas, or promote other sources of clean energy, our financial position, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Compliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly and could limit our operations." 
Non-U.S. Operations
Revenues from non-U.S. operations were 87%, 81%, 83% and 85% of our total consolidated revenues during eight months ended December 31, 2021 (Successor), four months ended April 30, 2021 (Predecessor), year-ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (Predecessor), respectively. 
See "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our non-U.S. operations involve additional risks not associated with U.S. operations."
