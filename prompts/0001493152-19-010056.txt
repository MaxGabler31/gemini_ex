Item 1. Business
Business of Company
 
We were incorporated on January 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at 303 Wyman St Suite 300, Waltham, MA 02451. Our telephone number is 781-728-0007. Our fiscal year end is March 31.
 
On March 30, 2017, our name was changed from Luckycom Inc. to Luckycom Pharmaceuticals Inc. and again on April 11, 2018, our name was changed to Luckwel Pharmaceuticals Inc. In connection with the most recent name change, on April 13, 2018, our common stock began trading on the OTC Pink under its new ticker symbol “LWEL” and ceased trading under the ticker symbol “LCOM”. Also on April 13, 2018, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000.
 
We are presently still a shell company and have not begun operations. We have no source of revenue and need additional cash resources to maintain the operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or obtain necessary debt financing. We are presently dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Kingrich Lee to either provide us funding for its daily operation and expenses, including professional fee and fees charged by regulators, although he is under no obligation to do so, or to spearhead financing efforts with third parties.
 
We currently do not have any arrangements in place to complete any financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable.
 
Our priority, should we receive such additional funds, is to pay our legal, accounting and other fees associated with our Company and our filing obligations under United States federal securities laws, as well as to pay our other accounts payable generated in the ordinary course of our business.
 
Once these costs are accounted for, we will focus on the following activities:
 

1. | Establish a management team by December 2019 to work on establishing pharmaceutical operations in Waltham/Boston, focusing on hypertension candidate drug (KL-008) and rheumatoid arthritis candidate drug (KL-009); 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Start intellectual property registration work by December 2019. 
3. | Penetrate the generic drugs market in Asia. 



Any failure to raise money will have the effect of delaying the timeframes in the business plan as set forth above, and we may have to push back the dates of such activities.

Sales and Marketing
 
Given our current stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. We plan to build up an international network after we achieve our financial targets.
Competition
 
The industry we plan to be in is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products).
Employees
 
We do not have any employees, other than Mr. Kingrich Lee.
