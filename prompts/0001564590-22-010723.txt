Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage fully integrated oncology company built on a foundation of drug discovery excellence to deliver novel precision cancer medicines to underserved patients. By leveraging our core competencies in cancer biology and medicinal chemistry, combined with our target class- and technology platform-agnostic approach, we have built an efficient, fully-integrated drug discovery engine to identify compelling biological targets and create new chemical entities, or NCEs, that we rapidly advance into clinical trials. We believe our approach could result in better targeted cancer therapies. Our discovery excellence has been validated by our rapid progress in creating a wholly-owned, internally developed pipeline. Since our inception in 2016, we have received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for six investigational new drug applications, or INDs, and successfully advanced these programs into clinical trials. In addition, we have two unique programs in various stages of preclinical development that we plan to advance into clinical development in 2022.
 
By focusing on developing agents using broad mechanisms that have multiple links to oncogenic driver pathways in select patients, we have developed a diverse pipeline consisting of six distinct programs spanning methyltransferases, kinases, protein-protein interactions and targeted protein degraders. Our pipeline is geared towards serving patients with high unmet medical need where there are limited or no treatment options. We believe we can best address these diseases by developing therapies that target primary and secondary resistance mechanisms.

The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline:
 

Our most advanced candidates are designed to be oral, potent and selective inhibitors of protein arginine methyltransferase 5, or PRMT5. The potency and selectivity of our product candidates is supported by preclinical data demonstrating nanomolar inhibition of PRMT5 and no inhibition of related enzymes at 1,000 times higher concentration of our product candidates. PRT543, our first clinical candidate, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors and select myeloid malignancies. As of an August 6, 2021 data cutoff date, the dose escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PRT543 enrolled a total of 49 patients across 18 unselected advanced solid tumors and lymphoma. Patients enrolled in the trial received an average of three prior lines of therapy. PRT543 demonstrated target engagement and inhibition of PRMT5 functional activity as evidenced by a 69% reduction in serum symmetric dimethylarginine, or sDMA, at a dose of 45 mg/5x per week. In addition, PRT543 demonstrated signs of preliminary clinical activity, including a durable complete response, or CR, maintained for over 18 months in a patient with HRD+ ovarian cancer who remains on treatment, and prolonged stable disease, or SD, persisting for over six months in five patients, including four patients with ACC and one patient with uveal melanoma. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PRT543 was generally well tolerated: the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, or AEs, occurring in at least 5% of patients were thrombocytopenia (27%) and anemia (12%), both of which were reversible upon treatment interruption. Patients were largely able to remain on therapy with few AE-related dose interruptions (27%), reductions (22%), or discontinuations (4%).
 
Patient enrollment is continuing in specific biomarker-selected solid tumor and hematologic malignancy expansion cohorts. We anticipate presenting data from those expansion cohorts in the second half of 2022.
 
PRT811, our second clinical candidate, is a PRMT5 inhibitor that we have optimized for high brain exposure. PRT811 is being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in unselected patients with solid tumors, including high-grade glioma. As of an August 13, 2021 data cutoff date, the dose escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PRT811 enrolled a total of 45 patients, including 27 patients across 16 unselected advanced solid tumors and 18 patients with high-grade gliomas, including 17 patients with glioblastoma multiforme. PRT811 demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of PRMT5 activity as evidenced by an 83% reduction in serum sDMA at a dose of 600 mg daily (QD). In addition, PRT811 demonstrated signs of preliminary clinical activity, including an IDH1 mutated high-grade glioma (glioblastoma (GBM)) patient who experienced a partial response, or PR, that evolved into a durable CR for more than 13 months. In addition, a patient with splicing-mutant, or SF3B1, uveal melanoma demonstrated SD for more than six months with a 25% tumor regression. At a post data-cutoff on September 20, 2021, one additional patient (receiving a dose of 800 mg QD) with SF3B1 uveal melanoma had an unconfirmed PR and 47% decrease in target lesion, and a patient with triple negative breast cancer (receiving a dose of 800 mg QD) demonstrated a 27% decrease in target lesions. PRT811 was generally well-tolerated; the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related AE was thrombocytopenia (7%), which was reversible upon treatment interruption. Patients were largely able to remain on therapy with few AE-related dose interruptions (13%), reductions (4%), or discontinuations (3%). 
 
On March 9, 2022, we announced that we are concentrating our further development efforts on PRT811 in biomarker-selected patients in specific cancer types. While the Company believes that both PRT811 and PRT543 are high quality, 
 3
 

clinically active compounds, PRT811 was selected based on its superior safety profile, higher level of target engagement, and unique brain penetrant properties. 
 
Specifically, we intend to:
  
• | Focus clinical development in select patient populations where clinical activity has been observed, including splicing mutated myeloid malignancies and solid tumors including uveal melanoma and IDH1 mutated high grade gliomas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete data analysis of the ongoing expansion cohort of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) by mid-year to determine further development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Report data from the ongoing dose expansion cohorts in the second half of 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Determine appropriate development options for PRT811 based on emerging data from ongoing expansion cohorts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
PRT1419, our third clinical candidate, is designed to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein, MCL1. The potency and selectivity of PRT1419 is supported by preclinical data demonstrating nanomolar inhibition of MCL1 and no inhibition of related enzymes at 200 times higher concentration of our product candidate. We have begun enrolling patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, and multiple myeloma, or MM, into the Phase 1 clinical trial for the oral formulation of PRT1419. The dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial of both oral formulation and the intravenous, IV, formulation, which leverages the optimized physicochemical properties of PRT1419, are underway in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
 
On March 9, 2022, we announced that we are prioritizing development of the IV formulation of PRT1419, which demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile with potential for differentiation from competitor compounds. We intend to initiate a combination trial with venetoclax by mid-year with the goal of establishing safety, clinical activity and a recommended Phase 2 dose in the second half of 2022.
 
PRT2527, our fourth clinical candidate, is designed to be a potent and selective Cyclin-dependent kinase 9, or CDK9, inhibitor. In preclinical studies, PRT2527 was shown to reduce MCL1 and MYC protein levels and was highly active in preclinical models at well-tolerated doses. PRT2527 has demonstrated high potency and kinase selectivity which may offer improved efficacy and safety compared to less selective CDK9 inhibitors. Preclinical data demonstrated that treatment with PRT2527 depleted oncogenic drivers with short half-lives, such as MYC and MCL1, and effectively induced apoptosis. PRT2527 treatment demonstrated robust efficacy in both hematological malignancies and solid tumor models with MYC dysregulation. A phase one trial is underway evaluating escalating IV doses of PRT2527 as a monotherapy in patients with selected solid tumors, including sarcoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers with genomic alterations that lead to MYC dependence.
 On March 9, 2022, we announced that we intend to complete enrollment in the Phase 1 dose escalation study of PRT2527 with the goal of identifying a recommended Phase 2 dose in the second half of 2022.
 
In addition to our four clinical stage candidates, we are advancing two new preclinical programs. Our most advanced preclinical program has led to the identification of PRT3645, a brain penetrant molecule that potently and selectively targets CDK4/6. IND-enabling studies for PRT3645 are ongoing and we plan to complete IND-enabling studies, file an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2022. Our second pre-clinical program targets Brahma homologue, or BRM, otherwise known as SMARCA2. We have identified SMARCA2 protein degraders that demonstrate selective degradation of SMARCA2 at sub-nanomolar concentrations. We are currently profiling our lead compound, PRT-SCA2, and plan to submit an IND application by year-end 2022.
 
Prelude Discovery and Development Approach
 
We carefully evaluate and select our targets based on three key pillars, which provide a framework for optimizing our drug discovery and development efforts.
 
 
• | Identify target mechanisms with compelling biological rationale
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Current target mechanisms of focus include: transcriptional regulation, deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, repair pathway, cell cycle regulation, exploitation of synthetic lethality and brain penetrant molecules.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Leverage our advanced medicinal chemistry capabilities to create better product candidates
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We view all target classes equally and strive to invent clinical candidates that meet our desired target product profiles.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue targets that drive cancers with high unmet need
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on targets that allow us to select patients and cancers with high unmet need with no approved therapies, or patient populations that are underserved by approved treatments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Once we have identified optimal targets using the three pillars above, we engage our unique discovery engine to rapidly and efficiently invent and develop molecules. We believe our expertise, capabilities and experience to select high value biological targets and invent molecules with an optimized balance of biological and chemical properties differentiates us from others in the precision oncology space. We believe our unique discovery engine will enable us to continue delivering a new IND every 12 to 18 months.
 
We design our clinical trials to leverage the broad utility of our compounds with a focus on efficient regulatory pathways to enable our potentially transformative medicines to quickly reach patients with high unmet medical need. By focusing on validated cancer signaling pathways and early clinical proof-of-concept, we seek to advance our programs through expedited approval processes.
 Our Strategy
 
We aim to create better targeted and more effective cancer therapies. Our goal is to transform the lives of patients with cancer by leveraging the core competencies of our experienced team in medicinal chemistry, cancer biology and clinical development to bring novel drugs to market. We intend to become a fully integrated oncology company on the foundation of drug discovery excellence to deliver novel precision oncology medicines to patients with underserved cancers by pursuing the following objectives:
 
 
• | Leverage our cancer biology and medicinal chemistry expertise to strive to deliver one new IND every 12 – 18 months.

Cancer Background and Treatment
 
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and more than 608,570 people are expected to die of the disease in the United States in 2021. Cancer is a disease of the genome caused by changes in DNA that alter cell behavior, growth and division. These changes can cause cells to produce abnormal amounts of certain proteins and/or to make aberrant proteins that do not function properly. It is widely understood that cancer cells can eventually evade therapies through mutations or other resistance mechanisms, limiting the long-term success of drug therapies.
 
Historically, cancer has been treated with surgery, radiation and drug therapy with patients often receiving a combination of these treatment modalities. While surgery and radiation can be effective in patients with localized disease, drug therapies are often required when the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or is not amenable to resection.
 5
 


Drug therapy is intended to kill or damage malignant cells by interfering with the biological processes that control development, growth and survival of cancer cells. This treatment modality has evolved over time from the use of non-specific cytotoxic therapies to precision oncology medicines targeting molecular pathways or oncogenic drivers. These precision medicines are broadly known as targeted therapies.
 

Our Product Candidates
 
PRMT5 Inhibitors: PRT543 & PRT811
 
Rationale for targeting the PRMT5 pathway in cancer
 
Cancer is a disease of the genome and all cancers have genomic lesions that must be addressed to develop effective treatments. These genomic changes are important at all stages of cancer progression, including initial formation, growth, and metastasis, and result in the upregulation of genes that promote cell growth and survival together with the downregulation of genes that suppress tumor growth.
 
PRMT5 controls a number of the biological processes that drive cancer including transcription, translation, DNA repair and cell signaling. Overexpression and increased enzymatic activity of PRMT5 are associated with poor outcome and decreased survival in multiple human cancer settings, as outlined in the table below.
 
 
Tumor type | Sample Size of Patients | | Median Survival (High PRMT5) | | Median Survival (Low PRMT5) | Log rank p-value |

PRMT5 Regulates Transcription and Translation of Cancer-related Genes
 
The oncogenic process controlled by PRMT5 is mediated through the symmetric dimethylation of arginines on its substrate proteins (Figure 1). PRMT5, an intracellular enzyme, transfers two methyl groups from a co- factor S-adenosyl methionine, or SAM, and deposits them on its substrate proteins resulting in the formation of a symmetric dimethylarginine, or sDMA, mark. This post-translational modification alters the protein structure, impacts interactions with DNA, and also generates docking sites for effector molecules that can promote tumor cell growth and survival. PRMT5 substrate proteins include:
 
 
• | Histones—basic proteins that associate with DNA in the nucleus and help condense it into chromatin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transcription factors—proteins involved in the process of transcribing DNA into ribonucleic acid, or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 RNA; and
 
 
• | Spliceosomal proteins—large protein complex that removes introns from pre-mRNA to yield mature

Figure 1. PRMT5 Pathway Drives Oncogenesis and Resistance


Through arginine methylation of histones, transcription factors and the spliceosome complex, PRMT5 regulates the expression of genes involved in promoting cancer cell growth and survival. These include cell cycle genes, tumor suppressors, oncogenes, and genes involved in proliferation and signaling.
 PRMT5-regulated transcription factors, including cyclin D1 and MYC, have a well-established role in a number of cancers. Conversely, PRMT5-mediated methylation of histones such as H3 and H4 represses a number of tumor suppressor genes including retinoblastoma, or RB, family members, contributing to unchecked proliferation of malignant cells. In addition, PRMT5 symmetrically dimethylates ribosomal binding proteins and modulates mRNA translation of internal ribosome entry site-containing mRNAs, further promoting the generation of oncogenic proteins. Consistent with its role in promoting cancer, PRMT5 inhibition has been shown to decrease tumor growth in preclinical models. Therefore, PRMT5 is believed to serve as an important mediator of cancer progression and can be targeted to treat a range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. These attributes make PRMT5 an ideal therapeutic target for cancer.
 
The role of PRMT5 in regulating gene transcription and translation may be particularly relevant in cancers such as ACC where up to 86% of patients harbor the gene fusion of the MYB family members MYB or MYBL1 with the Nuclear Factor 1B, or NFIB, gene. MYB or MYBL1 gene fusions lead to overexpression of the MYB/ MYBL1 protein. Published data demonstrate that MYB overexpression is important for driving cell proliferation and tumor growth in preclinical ACC models. In addition, our internal data illustrate that PRMT5 inhibition decreased MYB expression levels in MYB-dependent preclinical models and inhibited tumor growth in PDX models of ACC. Recent evidence of clinical activity with a third party PRMT5 inhibitor in patients with ACC further validates PRMT5 as a potential target mechanism in this highly underserved cancer.
 

PRMT5 Regulates mRNA Splicing in Cancer Cells
 
In addition to regulating transcription, PRMT5 also modulates gene expression by controlling mRNA splicing. Splicing is a fundamental cellular process that involves the removal of noncoding sequences from the precursor mRNA to produce the mature form that encodes for protein. In the absence of correct mRNA splicing, mutated or unstable proteins are produced, ultimately leading to cell cycle defects, senescence and apoptosis. The splicing reaction is carried out by a multi-protein/RNA complex called the spliceosome. PRMT5 plays an important role in the splicing of mRNA through methylation of spliceosome protein, which is critical for the assembly of the spliceosome complex and its function. In preclinical models, tumors with high degrees of proliferation, such as MYC-driven tumors, were associated with increased activity of PRMT5 to maintain the fidelity of the spliceosome, demonstrating the importance of PRMT5 in this process.
 
The role of PRMT5 in regulating mRNA splicing may be most relevant in cancers with spliceosomal mutations or those that are dependent on high splicing fidelity, such as GBM. Spliceosomal mutations also occur in more than 50% of MDS patients and at lower frequencies in other tumor types including MF, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, AML, NHL, MM, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, and uveal melanoma. These spliceosomal alterations are often correlated
7
 

with higher mutational burden and/or poor prognosis. In models of AML, preclinical data demonstrated that PRMT5 inhibition resulted in higher levels of suppression of the growth of cancer cells containing mutated spliceosome proteins compared to those containing unmutated spliceosome proteins.
 
Synthetic lethality from PRMT5 inhibition in certain settings
 
Synthetic lethality applies to specific pairs of genes. A synthetic lethal interaction occurs when a deficiency in either gene alone is viable whereas a deficiency in both genes simultaneously results in cell death. In cancer, synthetic lethality can be exploited to selectively kill cancer cells in which one gene in the pair is mutated or deleted in the tumor cell and the remaining second gene is therapeutically inhibited. This leads to death of the cancer cells whereas normal cells, which lack the specific genetic alteration, are spared the effect of the drug. In the case of PRMT5, it has been demonstrated that certain genomic alterations confer a selective dependence on PRMT5 so that PRMT5 inhibition can be utilized to produce a synthetic lethal effect. For example, PRMT5 inhibition shows a modest preferential impairment of cell viability in methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, -null cancer cells compared to normal cells, suggesting that PRMT5 inhibitors could produce a synthetic lethal effect in GBM, in which nearly half of the patients carry the MTAP deletion.
 The synthetic lethal effect of pharmacological inhibitors of DNA repair mechanisms such as poly ADP- ribose polymerases, or PARPs, have been successfully utilized in the treatment of HRD+ cancers. HRD+ can occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic mechanisms that result in loss of genes such as breast cancer genes, or BRCA1 and BRCA2, that are required for efficient DNA repair. More recent data support the potential synthetic lethality of PRMT5 inhibition in tumors that are HRD+ due to the role of PRMT5 in DNA repair (Figure 2). PRMT5 upregulates the transcription of genes involved in HR repair to regulate the DNA damage repair response. PRMT5 inhibition has been shown preclinically to decrease expression of these genes to induce cell death, supporting the potential of PRMT5 inhibitors in HRD+ tumors.
 
Together, these data support the development of PRMT5 inhibitors in select solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
 

PRT543
 
Overview
 
We are currently advancing our first clinical candidate PRT543, an oral inhibitor of PRMT5 in a Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced solid tumors and select myeloid malignancies.
Clinical Trial Design and Schema
 Our PRT543 Phase 1 clinical trial design seeks to leverage PRT543’s broad potential therapeutic utility to rapidly generate proof-of-concept across multiple solid tumors and myeloid malignancies. Trial enrollment of patients with relapsed/refractory, or R/R, advanced solid tumors, NHL (Group A) or R/R MF or MDS (Group B) commenced in February 2019 and is being conducted at approximately 25 sites throughout the United States. This clinical trial consists of two parts, a dose escalation portion followed by dose expansion into separate tumor-specific cohorts. Enrollment into the additional dose expansion cohorts began early in the second quarter of 2021. Total expected enrollment is anticipated to be approximately 165 patients. 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRT543
 All data are reflective of a data cutoff of August 6, 2021 unless otherwise stated. As of an August 6, 2021 data cutoff date, the dose escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PRT543 enrolled a total of 49 patients across 18 unselected advanced solid tumors and lymphoma. Patients enrolled received an average of three prior lines of therapy. PRT543 demonstrated target engagement and inhibition of PRMT5 functional activity as evidenced by a 69% reduction in serum symmetric dimethylarginine, or sDMA, at a dose of 45 mg/5x per week. In addition, PRT543 demonstrated signs of preliminary clinical activity, including a durable CR, maintained for over 18 months in a patient with HRD+ ovarian cancer who remains on treatment and prolonged SD, persisting for over six months in five patients, including four patients with ACC and one patient with uveal melanoma. A complete response is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.
 
PRT543 was generally well tolerated: the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, or AE, occurring in at least 5% of patients were thrombocytopenia (27%) and anemia (12%), both of which were reversible upon 
 8
 

treatment interruption. Patients were largely able to remain on therapy with few AE-related dose interruptions (27%), reductions (22%), or discontinuations (4%).
 
While early in development and there is no guarantee of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we are encouraged by the clinical activity of PRT543.
 
Based on data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose expansion studies of both PRT543 and PRT811, we announced, on March 9, 2022, that we are concentrating our development efforts on PRT811 in biomarker-selected patients in specific cancer types. While the Company believes that both PRT811 and PRT543 are high quality, clinically active compounds, PRT811 was selected based on its superior safety profile, higher level of target engagement, and unique brain penetrant properties. 
 
Specifically, we intend to:
  
• | Focus clinical development in select patient populations where clinical activity has been observed, including splicing mutated myeloid malignancies and solid tumors including uveal melanoma and IDH1 mutated high grade gliomas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete data analysis of the ongoing expansion cohort of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) by mid-year to determine further development.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Report data from the ongoing dose expansion cohorts in the second half of 2022.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 PRT811
 Overview
 Our second PRMT5 inhibitor, PRT811 has completed a Phase 1 dose escalation study and is currently enrolling dose expansion cohorts. PRT811 is designed to be a highly potent, selective and orally bioavailable molecule optimized for high brain exposure and hence we believe is uniquely positioned to treat PRMT5-sensitive CNS cancers among other solid tumors. Data from the expansion cohorts are expected to be presented in the second half of 2022.
Clinical Trial Design and Schema
 This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, dose-expansion Phase 1 clinical trial of PRT811. Enrollment into the dose escalation portion of the clinical trial includes patients with R/R solid tumors, PCNSL, and /or high-grade gliomas. Enrollment initiated in November 2019 and is being conducted across eleven sites in the United States. We initiated enrollment of the dose expansion portion of the clinical trial in three patient cohorts in December 2021. The total expected enrollment is approximately 63 patients.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRT811
 All data are reflective of a data cutoff of August 13, 2021 unless otherwise stated.
 
The dose escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1 trial of PRT811 enrolled a total of 45 patients, including 27 patients across 16 unselected advanced solid tumors and 18 patients with high-grade gliomas, including 17 patients with glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. PRT811 demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of PRMT5 activity as evidenced by an 83% reduction in serum sDMA at a dose of 600 mg daily (QD). In addition, PRT811 demonstrated signs of preliminary clinical activity, including an IDH1 mutated high-grade glioma (glioblastoma (GBM)) patient who experienced a PR that evolved into a durable CR for more than 13 months. In addition, a patient with splicing-mutant, or SF3B1, uveal melanoma demonstrated SD for more than six months with a 25% tumor regression. At a post data-cutoff on September 20, 2021, one additional patient (receiving a dose of 800 mg QD) with SF3B1 uveal melanoma had an unconfirmed PR and 47% decrease in target lesion, and a patient with triple negative breast cancer (receiving a dose of 800 mg QD) demonstrated a 27% decrease in target lesions. PRT811 was generally well-tolerated; the most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related AE was thrombocytopenia (7%), which was reversible upon treatment interruption. Patients were largely able to remain on therapy with few AE-related dose interruptions (13%), reductions (4%), or discontinuations (3%). 
 
Based on data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose expansion studies of both PRT543 and PRT811, we announced on March 9, 2022, that we are concentrating our development efforts on PRT811 in biomarker-selected patients in specific cancer types.
 
Specifically, we intend to:

MCL1 Inhibitor: PRT1419
 Overview
 PRT1419 is designed to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein, MCL1. PRT1419 has been optimized to have the PK properties to allow for either oral or IV administration, providing maximal coverage of the target while maintaining an adequate tolerability window. We believe that the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of PRT1419 allow the optionality of administering PRT1419 by either oral or IV route. Based on our preclinical data, as well as published third-party data, we believe that hematological malignancies are particularly sensitive to MCL1 inhibitors. MCL1 upregulation has been noted as a mechanism of acquired resistance to venetoclax and TKIs. In addition, certain solid tumors are responsive to MCL1 inhibition, informing a potential patient selection strategy. Based on data demonstrating that MCL1 is a primary resistance mechanism to BCL2 inhibitors like venetoclax, a combination study with azacitidine or venetoclax in 
 10
 

MDS/AML is planned. The dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial of both oral formulation and the IV formulation, which leverages the optimized physicochemical properties of PRT1419, are now underway in patients with solid tumors.
 Background
 The ability to evade cell death is a hallmark of cancer because it is one of the unique acquired abilities that allows malignant transformation of a normal cell. MCL1 and BCL2 are both members of a family of proteins that regulate cell survival versus cell death. Under normal circumstances, MCL1 and BCL2 exert their pro-survival function by binding to and sequestering the pro-death proteins, BAK and BAX, and prevent the activation of a downstream cascade leading to apoptosis (Figure 3). In normal cells, cellular stressors such as DNA damage disrupt this interaction and result in cell death. Cancer cells, however, frequently upregulate pro-survival proteins to prevent activation of the apoptotic pathway, thus evading death. MCL1 has been shown to have a critical role in promoting cancer cell survival and is frequently found to be amplified or overexpressed in both solid tumors and hematologic cancers.
Figure 3. MCL1 Promotes Tumor Cell Survival by Inhibiting Apoptosis


Members of the BCL2 protein family control cell survival and cell death. MCL1, a member of the family, acts to suppress cell death and has emerged as a target for anti-cancer therapy and as a resistance mechanism to the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax.
 Inhibition of MCL1 expression and/or function is therefore of considerable therapeutic interest in cancer. The importance of blocking the protein-protein interaction between pro-survival and pro-death proteins as a therapy to promote tumor cell death has been clinically validated with the BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax. Venetoclax was approved in 2016 for R/R patients with CLL and in 2018 for patients with AML. MCL1 is upregulated in response to BCL2 inhibition and has been implicated in mediating resistance to venetoclax, as well as to chemotherapeutic agents and other targeted therapies including TKIs. These studies have demonstrated the potentially broad clinical benefits of targeting cell survival through MCL1 inhibition in cancer.
 Small molecule MCL1 inhibitors have been shown to be remarkably efficacious as monotherapy in preclinical models of MM, AML and lymphoma. Treatment with these inhibitors leads to robust activation of apoptosis markers including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in vivo and in vitro. Objective clinical responses were demonstrated in a Phase 1 multiple myeloma clinical trial with AMG176, a third-party MCL1 inhibitor, providing clinical validation of the pathway. MCL1 inhibitors have also demonstrated potent synergistic activity in combination with approved standard of care therapies, including venetoclax, in preclinical models of AML. Although these inhibitors show limited efficacy as monotherapy in solid tumor models, combination with TKIs has resulted in potent anti-tumor effects in triple negative breast cancer, melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer.

Although the data on the importance of MCL1 in driving tumor growth and survival are compelling, complete ablation of MCL1 has been shown to result in cardiomyocyte apoptosis in mice. Mice with heterozygous deletion of Mcl1 resulting in a 50% reduction in MCL1 protein did not demonstrate cardiac abnormalities. These results suggest that an optimized profile for a pharmacological inhibitor of MCL1 should allow for maximal but limited duration of target engagement rather than prolonged coverage to maximize the therapeutic window of MCL1 inhibition in clinical development.
 Our Approach to Designing Optimized MCL1 Inhibitors
 We used structure-based design to identify PRT1419 as an inhibitor of human MCL1 that is designed to induce tumor cell death by apoptosis. It has been optimized to have high permeability and adequate solubility to provide suitable PK that allows for oral and IV dosing. We believe these features have the potential to maximize the therapeutic window and overcome some of the limitations of current MCL1 inhibitors, as well as provide the convenience and flexibility associated with oral dosing both as monotherapy and potentially in combination with other oral therapies.
 PRT1419
 Potency and Selectivity
 We investigated the in vitro potency of PRT1419 to inhibit the protein-protein interaction of human recombinant MCL1 with the pro-death protein, BIM, by measuring its IC50. In this assay, we observed the IC50 of PRT1419 to be 6.6 nM. We also investigated the in vitro selectivity of PRT1419 for MCL1 as compared to related family members, BCL-2 and BCLXL. We observed that PRT1419 showed >200 times weaker inhibition of BCL-2 and BCLXL compared to MCL1.
 Tumor cells undergo apoptosis in response to MCL1 inhibition. Therefore, we investigated the potency of PRT1419 to inhibit the proliferation of cell lines representing both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Tumor cell lines were treated with various concentrations of PRT1419 and the number of viable cells was measured after two days in culture. We observed that cell lines representing multiple myeloma, lymphomas and leukemias were particularly sensitive to PRT1419 with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. The in vitro activity of PRT1419 was confirmed in vivo. Once weekly dosing of PRT1419 demonstrated robust efficacy in preclinical models of AML, DLBCL and multiple myeloma.
 Clinical Trial Update
 Two dose escalation Phase I studies for our oral and IV formulation of PRT1419 are on-going in patients with hematologic malignancies, including patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, and multiple myeloma, or MM. A third dose escalation Phase I study for our IV formulation of PRT1419 is on-going for patients with unselected solid tumors.
 On March 9, 2022, we announced that based on the data to date, we intend to prioritize development of the IV formulation of PRT1419, which demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profile with potential for differentiation from competitor compounds. We intend to initiate a combination trial with venetoclax by mid-year with the goal of establishing safety, clinical activity and a recommended Phase 2 dose in the second half of 2022.
 CDK9 Program
 
Overview
 
CDK9 has emerged as an essential regulator of cancer-promoting transcriptional programs, including those driven by MCL1, MYC and MYB. Inhibition of CDK9 is thus an attractive therapeutic approach to produce synthetic lethality in genomically selected cancers. We have applied our internal expertise to design PRT2527 as a potent inhibitor of CDK9 that exhibits high kinome selectivity, PK properties and solubility that we believe may broaden the therapeutic window of CDK9 inhibition. A phase 1 trial is underway evaluating escalating IV doses of PRT2527 as a monotherapy in patients with selected solid tumors, including sarcoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and other cancers with genomic alterations that lead to MYC dependence.

Background
 
Cyclin dependent kinases, or CDKs, are a family of closely related serine/threonine kinases that have demonstrated activity in multiple cancers. The first inhibitors of two of the family members, CDK4 and CDK6, gained FDA approval for HR+ metastatic breast cancer in 2015 and are now broadly used. In contrast to CDK4 and CDK6, which regulate cell cycle progression and proliferation, it is now appreciated that other members of the CDK family play important roles in regulating transcription. CDK9 specifically phosphorylates RNA polymerase II to generate mature mRNA. Given its fundamental role in transcription, CDK9 has emerged as a central node in the transcriptional addiction of cancer.
 
Importantly, inhibition of CDK9 in cancer has been shown to preferentially deplete short-lived transcripts including key anti-apoptotic genes such as MCL1 and oncogenic transcription factors such as MYC and MYB. Preclinical evidence demonstrates that CDK9 inhibition represses MCL1 and thereby overcomes resistance to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Additionally, preclinical studies suggest that CDK9 inhibition perturbs MYC- mediated signaling and produces synthetic lethality in nuclear protein of the testis midline carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and additional solid tumors. Our patient selection strategy in clinical trials would strive to exploit these synthetic lethality relationships by identifying cancers with molecular evidence of MCL1 and/or MYC dysregulation.
 

Our CDK9 Inhibitor: PRT2527
 
Although various non-selective CDK9 inhibitors have progressed through clinical development, they have been significantly limited by narrow therapeutic windows due to adverse effects, including bone marrow suppression, nausea and GI effects. We have utilized structure-based design to identify a novel, structurally differentiated series of CDK9 inhibitors. Iterative synthesis and testing of over 600 compounds allowed the identification of PRT2527, which has improved potency and kinase selectivity compared to AZ4573, the most advanced CDK9-selective inhibitor currently in development. The PK and physical properties of PRT2527 are suitable for IV or SC dosing.
 
In preclinical models, PRT2527 reduced MCL1 and MYC protein levels and was highly active in the MYC- amplified MV4-11 xenograft model at well-tolerated doses. Upon evaluation of additional models, PRT2527 treatment demonstrated robust efficacy in both hematological malignancies and solid tumor models with MYC dysregulation. Our preclinical studies suggest that PRT2527 demonstrates high selectivity and high potency, providing opportunity for a wider therapeutic index compared to less selective CDK9 inhibitors.
 We intend to complete enrollment in the Phase 1 dose escalation study of PRT2527 with the goal of identifying a recommended Phase 2 dose in the second half of 2022.
 

CDK4/6 Program
 
Background
 Among the CDK subfamily of kinases, CDK4 and CDK6 are the master regulators that control entry of cells into cell cycle. Given the central roles that CDK4 and CDK6 play in cell cycle regulation, dysregulation of the CDK4/CDK6 pathway has been frequently observed in cancer and CDK4/CDK6 have been intensively investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. The approval of three CDK4/CDK6 selective inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapies, to treat hormone receptor (HR) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer has further validated this hypothesis.
 
Despite the success of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors for the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer, central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases are challenging malignancies with urgent unmet needs. Large scale genomic studies revealed that the CDK4/CDK6 pathway is disrupted in the majority of gliomas, suggesting CDK4/CDK6 may be good targets for GBM. In addition, brain metastases may arise in an estimated 20% of all cancer patients but still lacks effective therapies. Genomic studies also identified the CDK4/6 pathway as one of three most altered and actionable genetic alternations in brain metastasis. However, despite positive preclinical data supporting targeting CDK4/CDK6 to treat CNS cancers, clinical development of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors for GBM or brain metastases has not been successful, likely due to the inability of current inhibitors to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and achieve effective concentrations in the brain.  
 13
 


Our CDK4/6 Inhibitor: PRT3645
 Structure based design and iterative compound synthesis and testing led to the identification of PRT3645, a highly brain penetrant molecule that potently and selectively targets CDK4/6. In cellular assays, PRT3645 inhibits phosphorylation of RB, a substrate of CDK4/CDK6, with low nanomolar activity. Consistent with this, PRT3645 treatment results in concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation in glioblastoma (GBM) cell lines and in ER+/HER2- and HER2+ breast cancer lines. In vivo, orally administered PRT3645 was well tolerated and highly efficacious in a dose-dependent manner in orthotopic human breast cancer brain metastasis and GBM models. In a head to head comparison, PRT3645 demonstrated a brain:plasma ratio that was  ~100x higher than approved CDK4/6 inhibitors. We plan to complete IND-enabling studies, file an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2022.
 
SMARCA2 (BRM) targeted degrader program
 
Background
 
SMARCA2 (also known as BRM) and its related family member, SMARCA4 (also known as BRG1), are the enzymatic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex that regulates gene expression by allowing the DNA to be accessible for transcription to mature RNA, a process known as chromatin remodeling. SMARCA4 is mutated in multiple cancers, including 10-12% of NSCLC, resulting in loss of SMARCA4 protein. Because the activity of either SMARCA2 or SMARCA4 is required for chromatin remodeling to occur, the SMARCA4-deficient cancer cells become highly dependent on SMARCA2 for their survival. Therefore, we believe targeting SMARCA2 in SMARCA4-deficient cancers will produce a strong synthetic lethality, resulting in SMARCA4 mutant tumor cell death while sparing normal cells that express SMARCA4 protein.
 
Our SMARCA2 Degrader Program
 
Due to the high homology between SMARCA2 and SMARCA4, there are few structural differences in the binding sites between the two proteins and thus selective SMARCA2 degradation has been a challenge for medicinal chemistry. Targeted protein degradation is a relatively new approach to degrade oncogenic proteins and has been shown to provide selective degradation of highly homologous proteins. A molecule capable of targeting a protein for degradation (degrader) typically contains a binding element to a targeted protein of interest (SMARCA2), a chemical linker and an E3 ligase binding element which allows for the formation of a ternary complex between the target, the degrader and the E3 ligase that induces ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the targeted protein. Selectivity can be achieved, not only by the selective binding to the target (SMARCA2), but also through the optimization of the unique ternary complexes formed by the target (SMARCA2) versus its homologous protein (SMARCA4).
 
We used structure-based drug design to identify a novel series of potent SMARCA2 degraders that are outside the typical drug-like chemical space, being significantly larger and structurally more complex. Extensive structure activity relationships generated by the iterative synthesis and testing of >700 compounds as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K has allowed the identification of specific structural motifs that provide >20-fold selectivity for SMARCA2 degradation over SMARCA4 while maintaining potent SMARCA2 degradation, DC50 < 10 nM. DC50 is a quantitative measure of how much of a compound is needed to inhibit the degradation of a protein by 50%. We have designed our SMARCA2 degraders to be potent and selective to specifically inhibit SMARCA4- deficient human NSCLC cell lines and primary patient derived samples. We are currently profiling our lead compound, PRT-SCA2, and plan to submit an IND application by year-end 2022.

Other
 
In addition, we have patent portfolios that are directed to a number of different compounds other than PRT543, PRT811, PRT1419, PRT2527, PRT3645, SMARCA2 degraders, and CDK inhibitors. We have patent applications directed to compounds that target resistance mechanisms in cancer. We expect to maintain some of these applications in the United States and to also file in foreign countries.

In addition to the applications described above, we wholly-own 16 applications including U.S. provisional patent applications, U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and PCT applications, covering compositions and methods of making and using those compounds to treat cancer and other diseases.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted due to any failure of the United States Patent and Trademark Office following certain statutory and regulation deadlines for issuing a patent.
 
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the original expiration of the patent. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country.
 
Obtaining patent protection is not the only method that we employ to protect our proprietary rights. We also utilize other forms of intellectual property protection, including trademark, copyright, and trade secrets, when those other forms are better suited to protect a particular aspect of our intellectual property. Our belief is that our proprietary rights are strengthened by our comprehensive approach to intellectual property protection. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
 

Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, including pharmaceutical ingredients and clinical drug supply, as well as for commercial manufacture of any drugs that we may commercialize. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not own in-house warehouse facilities. We rely on third parties for storage and distribution of drug substance and drug product. We do not currently have arrangements in place
17
 

for redundant supply for active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug product. As our development programs progress and we build new process efficiencies, we expect to continually evaluate this strategy with the objective of satisfying demand for registration trials and, if approved, the manufacture, sale and distribution of commercial products.
 

Commercialization
 
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. If we are successful in obtaining necessary regulatory approval, we may pursue commercialization on our own or seek to collaborate with a third party for commercialization, particularly outside the United States.
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 

Competition
 
We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of precision oncology therapies optimized to target the key driver mechanisms in cancers with high unmet need. Several biopharmaceutical companies, including Arvinas Inc., Aurigene, Black Diamond Therapeutics, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim, C4 Therapeutics, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Foghorn Therapeutics Inc., Fochon Pharmaceuticals, G1 Therapeutics Inc., Genentech, Kronos Bio, Inc., Kura Oncology, Inc., Kymera Therapeutics Inc., Mirati Therapeutics Inc., Nuvation Bio Inc. Repare Therapeutics Inc., Revolution Medicines, Inc., Relay Therapeutics, Inc., Springworks Therapeutics, Inc., Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Zentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., are developing precision oncology medicines. In addition, we may face competition from companies developing product candidates that are based on targeting pathways of adaptive resistance, including Amgen Inc., AbbVie Inc., AstraZeneca plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ideaya Biosciences, Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Tango Therapeutics, Inc., Vincerx Pharma, Inc., Novartis AG, and Gilead Sciences, Inc.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the oncology market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, biologic therapy, such as monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, immunotherapy, cell-based therapy and targeted therapy, or a combination of any such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drugs and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market may pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new oncology therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
With respect to our PRMT5 programs, PRT543 and PRT811, several companies are developing PRMT5 inhibitors with clinical trials ongoing, including Amgen (AMG193), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK3326595), Ideaya Biosciences (IDE397), 
 18
 

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-64619178), Pfizer (PF-06939999), and Tango Therapeutics (TNG908). For our product candidate PRT1419, other companies are developing MCL1 inhibitors with monotherapy and/or combination trials ongoing, including Amgen (AMG176), AstraZeneca (AZD5991), Novartis (MIK665), and Gilead (GS-9716). For our CDK9 program, PRT2527, AstraZeneca (AZD4573), Vincerx (VIP512), and Kronos (KB-0742) have CDK9 programs in Phase 1 clinical trials. For our CDK4/6 inhibitor program, PRT3645 Novartis (ribociclib), Lilly (abemaciclib), Pfizer (palbociclib), G1 Therapeutics (G1T38), and Fochon Pharmaceuticals (FCN-437) have clinical trials ongoing. For our SMARCA 2 (BRM) degrader program, other companies, including Amgen, Aurigene, C4 Therapeutics, F. Hoffman-La Roche, Foghorn Therapeutics, Inc., Kymera Therapeutics, Arvinas, Genentech, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Lilly have publicly disclosed their pre-clinical research efforts.

We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with more favorable labeling than our product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long- term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good 
 19
 

clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
 

FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Imposition of a clinical hold may be full or partial. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, and ethics committee for approval. The IRB will also monitor the clinical trial until completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
 

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a drug demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence.
 These Phases may overlap or be combined. For example, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial may contain both a dose- escalation stage and a dose-expansion stage, the latter of which may confirm tolerability at the recommended dose for expansion in future clinical trials (as in traditional Phase 1 clinical trials) and provide insight into the anti-tumor effects of the investigational therapy in selected subpopulation(s).
 
Typically, during the development of oncology therapies, all subjects enrolled in Phase 1 clinical trials are disease-affected patients and, as a result, considerably more information on clinical activity may be collected during such trials than during Phase 1 clinical trials for non-oncology therapies. A single pivotal trial may be sufficient in rare instances to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness (generally subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies).
 
The manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls.
 
The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an
20
 

approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA adjusts the user fees on an annual basis, and the fees typically increase annually.
 
FDA reviews each submitted NDA before it determines whether to file it, based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, and FDA may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on whether to file an NDA within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is filed, FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late- submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA does not always meet its goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
Before approving an NDA, FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also typically inspects one or more clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter, or CRL, generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application, such as additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time- consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, engage in formal dispute resolution or request an opportunity for a hearing. FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If, or when, the deficiencies identified in the CRL have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of an NDA supplement or, in some case, a new NDA, before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
Fast Track Designation
 
Fast track designation may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The sponsor of an investigational drug product may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. At the time of NDA filing, the FDA will determine whether to grant priority review designation. FDA will grant such designation if the proposed drug would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition. Additionally, fast track designation may be withdrawn if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 

Accelerated Approval
 
Accelerated approval may be granted for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments. A product eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. The accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. These confirmatory trials must be completed with due diligence and, in most cases, the FDA may require that the trial be designed, initiated, and/or fully enrolled prior to approval. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of applications for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding
22
 

meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
 

Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a rare disease for which it has such designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Other benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA user fee.
 

Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except that PREA will apply to an original NDA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to 
 23
 

periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
Orange Book Listing
 
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments, NDA applicants are required to identify to FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug or approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant must update its listing of patents to the NDA in timely fashion and each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
 
Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), strength, route of administration, and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. An approved ANDA product is considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under the ANDA pathway are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug pursuant to each state’s laws on drug substitution.
 
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents identified for the reference listed drug in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify to each patent in one of the following ways: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. For patents listed that claim an approved method of use, under certain circumstances the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method- of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA-holder and patentee(s) once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA (referred to as the “notice letter”). The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice letter. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the date the notice letter is received, expiration of the patent, the date of a settlement order or consent decree signed and entered by the court stating that the patent that is the subject of the certification is invalid or not infringed, or a decision in the patent case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of certain non-patent exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA prescribing information.
 

Exclusivity
 
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug unless the application contains a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the application may be submitted one year prior to expiration of the NCE exclusivity. If there
24
 

is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA for a generic version of the drug may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
 
Certain changes to an approved drug, such as the approval of a new indication, the approval of a new strength, and the approval of a new condition of use, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. In some instances, an ANDA applicant may receive approval prior to expiration of the three-year exclusivity if the applicant seeks, and FDA permits, the omission of such exclusivity-protected information from the ANDA package insert.
 

Patent Term Extension
 
The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for the extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval) up to a maximum of five years. The time can be reduced for any time FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence.
 
The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. However, the USPTO may not grant an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than requested.
 
The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years, and only one patent can be extended. The application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and for patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
 

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
If use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the drug product. FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a cancer therapeutic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval and clearance of a companion diagnostic also requires a high level of coordination between the drug manufacturer and device manufacturer, if different companies.
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to a substantial application fee, which is typically increased annually.
 In addition, PMAs must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic has adequate sensitivity and specificity, has adequate specimen and reagent stability, and produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s
25
 

facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also register their establishment(s), including payment of an annual establishment registration fee, and list their device(s) with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, transparency and health information privacy laws and other healthcare laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal civil False Claims Act.
 
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
26
 


Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA.
 
Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, has issued a final rule that requires certain manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and annually report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Beginning calendar year 2021, manufacturers must collect information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse- midwives for reporting in 2022. The reported information is made publicly available on a searchable website. 
 
We may also be subject to analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor. In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals.
 Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain drug pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Additionally, we may also be subject to state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for

violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended.
 

U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of health care and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (i) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (ii) proscribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and therapeutic biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (iii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (iv) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and therapeutic biologics, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs (v) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (now 70%) point of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and therapeutic biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs and therapeutic biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D, (vi) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (vii) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health program (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (ix) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 There have been legislative and judicial efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, including measures taken during the Trump administration. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Reform Act, among other things, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court held oral arguments on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s decision that held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. It is uncertain how the United States Supreme court will rule on this case or how healthcare measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility, effective January 1, 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. United States federal government agencies also currently face potentially significant spending reductions, which may further impact healthcare expenditures. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction,
28
 

tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and is designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 extended the suspension of the 2% Medicare sequester through March 31, 2021. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may also impact the ability of relevant agencies, such as the FDA or the National Institutes of Health to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
 
Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs.

In particular, July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA also released a final rule on September 24, 2020 providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. The Trump and Biden administrations both issued executive orders intended to favor government procurement from domestic manufacturers. In addition, the Trump administration issued an executive order specifically aimed at the procurement of pharmaceutical products, which instructed the federal government to develop a list of “essential” medicines and then buy those and other medical supplies that are manufactured, including the manufacture of the API, in the United States. It is unclear whether this executive order or something similar will be implemented by the Biden Administration. 
 
Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. CMS also published an interim final rule that establishes an MFN Model for Medicare Part B drug payment. This regulation would substantially change the drug reimbursement landscape as it bases Medicare Part B payment for 50 selected drugs on prices in foreign countries instead of ASP and establishes a fixed add-on payment in place of the current 6 percent (4.3 percent after sequestration) of ASP. The MFN drug payment amount is expected to be lower than the current ASP-based limit because U.S. drug prices are generally the highest in the world. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule, and it faces uncertain prospects for implementation.

At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in most cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

It is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, on April 18, 2020, CMS announced that qualified health plan issuers under the ACA may suspend activities related to the collection and reporting of quality data that would have otherwise been reported between May and June 2020 given the challenges healthcare providers are facing responding to the COVID-19 virus.
 
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law.
 

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Patients in the United States and elsewhere generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse part or all of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Accordingly, market acceptance of our drug products is dependent on the extent to which third-party coverage and reimbursement is available from government health administration authorities (including in connection with government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States), private healthcare insurers and other healthcare funding organizations. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Coverage decisions may not favor new drug products when more established or lower-cost therapeutic alternatives are already available. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of our drug products.
 
Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement as the process of determining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly which will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be obtained. It is difficult to predict at this time what government authorities and third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for our drug products. Additionally, we may develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, if any, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
 
The market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures. In particular, third- party payors may refuse to include a particular reference listed drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a reference listed drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
 
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governmental entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs products from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more drug products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
