 LevelBlox’s business units will typically operate as stand-alone operations, but are supported by a seasoned executive team and a shared technology and administrative infrastructure. While the circumstances of every transaction are unique, we prefer to partner with top caliber executives, and skilled management teams of middle-market businesses and support them with the necessary tools to build each company into a leader in its segment. We believe this philosophy enables us to combine talents and technologies, share services and benefit from a range of centrally managed initiatives while maintaining the uniqueness and brand equity and culture of each unit and a decentralized decision-making structure.

LevelBlox leverages the vast experience that its executive team has amassed in creating the suitable financial architecture. Including its expertise in the public sector, follow-on offerings, private placements, other financial know-how as well as, the organizational frameworks (executive strategy and leadership, key C-level and technical staffing, supply chain development, etc.), that are critical, yet often beyond the means and experience of private companies.

All references to the previously acquired business Operations, Technology, Development, Sales / Marketing, Alliances and Customers, have been removed for this annual report.
