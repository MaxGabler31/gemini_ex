The Company’s vision is seeing a day when its customers say, “I can’t live without them.”
 Food Distribution Segment 
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment uses a multi-channel sales approach to distribute grocery products to independent retailers, national retailers, food service distributors, e-commerce providers, and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. Total net sales from the Company’s Food Distribution segment, including sales to corporate owned retail stores that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements, totaled $5.6 billion for 2021. As of the end of 2021, the Company is among the top five largest wholesale distributors in the nation in terms of annual revenue. The Company is focused on growth in its Food Distribution segment, through expanded partnerships with existing customers as well as new business.
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment supplies grocery products to a diverse group of independent retailers with operations ranging from a single store to regional supermarket chains, food service distributors and the Company’s corporate owned retail stores. As of January 1, 2022, the Company operated in all 50 states by leveraging a platform of 18 distribution centers, as well as internal transportation fleets and third-party shipping partners, servicing the Food Distribution and Military segments. The Company’s extensive geographic reach drives economies of scale and provides opportunities for independent retailers to purchase products at competitive prices in order to effectively compete in the grocery industry in the long-term. 
 The Company also services national retailers through a variety of platforms and has diversified its customer base through growth with these customers. These national retailers partner with the Company to centralize their supply of grocery products or product categories, and to leverage the Company’s broad geographic reach. Sales to one of the Company’s customers in the Food Distribution segment accounted for 17% of consolidated net sales for 2021, 2020 and 2019. No other individual customer exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales in any of the years presented.
 The Company’s ten largest Food Distribution customers (excluding corporate owned retail stores) accounted for approximately 64% of total Food Distribution net sales for 2021. Approximately 90% of Food Distribution net sales for 2021 are covered under supply agreements with customers. 
 The Company’s Food Distribution segment provides a selection of approximately 65,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products, including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, tobacco products, health and beauty care products and pharmacy. These product offerings, along with best-in-class services, allow independent retailers the opportunity to support the majority of their operations with a single supplier. The Company also provides a comprehensive menu of support services designed to assist independent retailers in becoming more profitable, efficient, competitive, and informed, ranging from real estate and site surveys to a full suite of accounting, information technology and merchandising and marketing solutions.

The Food Distribution segment competes directly with a number of traditional and specialty grocery wholesalers and retailers that maintain or develop self-distribution systems. In addition, the Company’s independent customers face intense competition from supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company partners with these customers to help them compete effectively. The primary competitive factors in the Food Distribution business include price, service level, product quality, variety and other value-added services.
 Retail Segment 
 As of January 1, 2022, the Company operates 145 corporate owned retail stores and 36 fuel centers in nine states in the Midwest, primarily under the banners of Family Fare, Martin’s Super Markets, D&W Fresh Market, VG’s Grocery and Dan’s Supermarket. Retail banners and store counts are fully detailed in Item 2, “Properties”. The Company’s corporate owned retail stores range in size from approximately 14,000 to 90,000 square feet, or on average, approximately 45,000 square feet per store.
 The Company’s convenience and community-focused strategy distinguishes its corporate owned retail stores from supercenters and limited assortment stores. This is complemented by an e-commerce platform, including Fast Lane and Groceries to GO, which provide online grocery shopping and curbside pickup or delivery at 121 corporate owned retail locations as of January 1, 2022. This channel is highly valued by customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and continuing to enhance and grow this platform is a key component of the Company’s strategy. The Company makes investments to support its online ordering systems, the speed and convenience of curbside pickup, and the efficiency and completeness of order fulfillment. 
 The Company’s corporate owned retail stores offer nationally branded and private brand grocery products, as well as perishable food products including dry groceries, produce, dairy products, meat, delicatessen items, including store prepared “grab and go” meal options, bakery goods, frozen food, seafood, floral products, general merchandise, beverages, health and beauty care products and fuel. Sixty-five of the Company’s stores contain franchised Starbucks or Caribou Coffee shops, which enhance the customer experience and help to drive traffic. Private brand grocery products typically generate higher retail margins while also improving customer loyalty by offering quality products at affordable prices.
 As of January 1, 2022, the Company offers pharmacy services in 91 of its corporate owned retail stores (81 of the pharmacies are owned) and operates three free-standing pharmacy locations. The Company believes the pharmacy service offering in its corporate owned retail stores is an important part of the consumer experience. Most of the Company’s pharmacies offer certain free medications, along with low-cost generic drugs, and counseling for preventative health and education for its customers. Influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations are available in the pharmacies.
 The following chart details the changes in the number of corporate owned retail stores over the last five fiscal years:
  
 | 2017 | | 2018 | | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 
-------------------------------------------+------+-----+------+-----+------+------+------+----
Number of stores at beginning of year | | 157 | | 145 | | 139 | | 156 | 156
Stores acquired or constructed during year | | — | | — | | 24 | | 1 | — 
Stores closed or sold during year | | 12 | | 6 | | 7 | | 1 | 11 
Number of stores at end of year | | 145 | | 139 | | 156 | | 156 | 145

 Store closures in 2021 were part of the Company’s retail store rationalization initiatives.
 The principal competitive factors in the Retail business include the location and image of the store; the price, quality and variety of the fresh offering; and the quality, convenience and consistency of service. In addition to competing with traditional grocery stores, the Company competes with supercenters, deep discounters, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, and e-commerce providers. The Company monitors planned competitive store openings and uses established proactive strategies to respond to new competition both before and after competitive store openings. Strategies to react to competition vary based on many factors, such as the competitor’s format, strengths, weaknesses, pricing and sales focus. 
 Military Segment 
 The Company’s Military segment contracts with manufacturers and brokers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges. The Company’s Military segment, together with its third-party partner, Coastal Pacific Food Distributors (“CPFD”), represents the only delivery solution to service the Defense Commissary Agency (“DeCA” or “the Agency”) worldwide.
 DeCA operates a chain of 236 commissaries on U.S. military installations across the world that sells approximately $4.0 billion of grocery products annually. The Company distributes grocery products to 160 military commissaries and over 400 exchanges located in 39 states across the United States and the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Djibouti. The Company’s distribution centers are strategically located among the largest concentration of military bases in the areas the Company serves and near Atlantic ports used to ship grocery products to overseas commissaries and exchanges.

The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to all U.S. military commissaries. In accordance with its contract with DeCA, the Company procures the grocery and related products from various manufacturers and upon receiving customer orders from DeCA either delivers the products to the U.S. military commissaries itself or engages CPFD to deliver the products on its behalf. There are nearly 1,000 SKUs of private brand products in the DeCA system as of January , 202.
 DeCA contracts with manufacturers to obtain nationally branded products for the commissary system. Manufacturers either deliver the products to the commissaries themselves or, more commonly, contract with distributors such as SpartanNash to deliver the products. The Company obtains distribution contracts with manufacturers through competitive bidding processes and direct negotiations. As of January 1, 2022, the Company has approximately 250 distribution contracts representing approximately 600 manufacturers that supply products to the DeCA commissary system and various exchange systems. Generally, larger contracts or those subject to a request-for-proposal process have definitive durations, whereas smaller contracts generally have indefinite terms; and all contract types allow for termination by either party without cause upon 30 days prior written notice to the other party. The contracts typically specify which commissaries and exchanges to supply on behalf of the manufacturer, the manufacturer’s products to be supplied, service and delivery requirements, and pricing and payment terms. The Company’s ten largest manufacturer customers represented approximately 52% of the Company’s Military segment sales for 2021. 
 The Company’s strategies within the Military segment are focused on improving the profitability of its operations through partnering with DeCA and its manufacturer customers to identify growth opportunities and improve gross margins. The current contract to provide DeCA with private branded products expires in April 2022. The Company is currently negotiating a contract extension.
 The Company is one of fewer than four distributors in the United States with annual sales to the DeCA commissary system in excess of $100 million that distributes products via the frequent delivery system. The remaining distributors that supply DeCA tend to be smaller regional and local providers. In addition, manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products, such as baking supplies, produce, delicatessen items, soft drinks and snack items, directly to DeCA commissaries and service exchanges. Because of the low margins in this industry, it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale, which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic area(s) a distributor serves. As a result, no single distributor in this industry, by itself, has a nationwide presence. Rather, distributors generally concentrate on specific regions, or areas within specific regions, where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently. In addition, distributors that operate larger non-military specific distribution businesses tend to compete for DeCA commissary business in areas where such business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing distribution centers. The Company believes the principal competitive factors among distributors within this industry are customer service, price, operating efficiencies, reputation with DeCA and location of distribution centers.
 Supply Chain Network
 The Company’s distribution network is comprised of 18 distribution centers, which are utilized to service the Food Distribution and Military segments. The Company warehouses product through approximately 8.6 million square feet of distribution center space. The Company operates a fleet with 553 over-the-road tractors, 25 refrigerated straight trucks, 272 dry vans and 1,090 refrigerated trailers. The Company carefully manages the approximate 73 million miles driven by its fleet and third-party carriers annually servicing military commissaries, exchanges, independent retailers, national retailers and corporate owned retail stores.
 In 2021, the Company launched and began execution of a comprehensive supply chain improvement initiative. The initiative is focused on executing improvements to supply chain operations across the Company’s network, which are expected to result in sustained efficiencies and cost reductions. The supply chain initiative is focused on making investments in people, process, and technology to support long-term growth and maximize operational efficiencies. The Company is investing in its workforce through an expansion of its onboarding, training and career development programs, and has identified several initiatives aimed at improving associate engagement, customer experience and overall supply chain performance. 
 The Company is currently improving a robust sales and operations planning process and also continues to optimize its network to enable more effective and efficient operations across the supply chain. The Company will continue to refine its inventory management and control policies and procedures, including item assortment decisions, while also developing dynamic slotting capabilities, in order to improve order selection efficiency and maximize space utilization. Process improvements are also underway in other areas of warehouse operations, including enhancing labor planning tools, refining engineered labor standards, and installing new performance management capabilities to improve productivity. 
 System enhancements in the areas of forecasting and replenishment will support the strategic optimization of inventory, allowing for improved service levels and warehouse capacities, while also reducing excess inventory and shrink. The Company’s plan to consolidate transportation management information systems will also streamline operations and reduce miles traveled.

Marketing and Merchandizing 
 During 2021, the Company leveraged data and insights to develop and implement strategies to respond to changes in consumer behavior in relation to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with products, meal solutions and marketing tactics in support of each of the Company’s segments. The Company is starting to see many customer behavior changes resulting from the pandemic become more permanent, requiring even deeper use of data and insights to stay abreast and drive performance.
 The Company’s Customer Growth strategy is focused on meeting changing customer needs and preferences through a data-based decision-making process, while also increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience. The Company is using insights gained through its collaboration with dunnhumby to improve its positioning and assortment to better appeal to its customers. Key focus areas include improvement in customers’ perception of Company pricing, product assortment and the penetration of the Company’s private brands. As the Company works to better differentiate its Retail stores and implement its Customer Growth strategy, the Company has launched a new pricing strategy designed to highlight value and increase customer loyalty. The Company has developed processes to measure the activation of these strategies as well as their impacts. These measures are reviewed continuously to refine and evolve the strategies. The Company will continue to share its best practices across its independent customer base within the Food Distribution segment as it gains further insights. 
 While the Company is selectively adding products and services to better meet customers’ changing needs and enhance their experience, the Company is also observing a migration to an overall smaller SKU count as part of a broader industry shift. At the same time CPG companies are beginning to focus on an efficient, more limited assortment. This makes the ongoing review and refinement of the private brand offering and go-to-market strategy even more critical. These changes support the Company’s ongoing review and refinement of the private brand offering and go-to-market strategy and efforts to simplify the brand portfolio and build on the strength of the Company’s flagship brand, Our Family. 
 The Company has also been building tools and capabilities to enable relevant, personalized content across its digital, social media and mobile channels, including the use of chatbots with artificial intelligence, which provide immediate responses to customers’ frequently asked questions online. Additionally, the Company continues to focus on the growth of its e-commerce platforms and development of the ecosystem, which enable a highly personalized digital shopping experience, while driving operational efficiencies. These enhancements will contribute to the Company’s ability to build longer-term customer loyalty through convenience and value, maintain efficient marketing spend, improve its growth opportunities, and further strengthen its competitive position.
 Seasonality 
 The majority of the Company’s revenues are not seasonal in nature. However, in some geographies, corporate retail stores and independent retail customers are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are affected by seasons and weather patterns. 
Suppliers 
 The Company purchases products from a large number of national, regional and local suppliers of name brand and OwnBrands merchandise. No single supplier accounts for more than 5% of the Company’s purchases. The Company continues to develop strategic relationships with key suppliers and believes this will prove valuable in the development of enhanced promotional programs and consumer value perceptions. 
Intellectual Property 
 The Company owns valuable intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, and other proprietary information, some of which are of material importance to its business. 
 Technology 
 In 2021, the Company focused on foundational IT hardware and digitization efforts across all business segments, including the continued transition to Software as a Service (“SaaS”) technology, where production environments are hosted in the cloud. 
 Supply Chain. The Company continued its transformational effort to replace its existing transportation systems, including standardization of processes and rationalization of several disparate systems into a single integrated application stack. Additionally, the Company completed the implementation of its automated timekeeping, scheduling, and payroll management processes across its distribution network. These automation initiatives, combined with the workforce investments noted previously, are expected to contribute to improved hiring, retention and productivity. The Company also completed the implementation of an AI forecasting system, which will enhance the Company’s inventory management and shrink reduction processes. 
 Retail. During 2021, the Company completed the financial integration of its recently acquired Martin’s Super Markets (“Martin’s”) business. The Company is taking additional steps to modernize its retail applications footprint, which began in 2021 with a comprehensive effort to upgrade and digitize its point-of-sale (“POS”) environment. The upgraded POS application includes an integrated feature set which enhances the retail experience both for SpartanNash and its independent customers.
 Marketing and Merchandizing. In 2021, the Company continued its implementation of a cloud-based pricing and promotion automation solution. The new technology will provide a vendor portal and workflow management for promotional activities, as well as manage associated vendor billings for all of its customers.

Administrative Systems, Infrastructure and Security. The Company has begun the development and implementation of tools to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of internal reporting and administrative functions. A centralized cloud-based data analytics solution was implemented to consolidate the Company’s analysis and reporting platforms, which brings advanced data analytics capabilities to provide better business insights in real-time. Robotic process automation initiatives have been implemented in certain areas and additional areas are being evaluated for further automation, which will result in improved efficiency in repetitive, manual processes. During 2021, the Company also took significant steps to improve its information security. Lastly, the Company made several enhancements to its foundational hardware infrastructure including upgrades to the production storage environment and network servers.
Human Capital
 The Company values its associates and remains committed to them through transparent communications to ensure that they feel heard, respected and valued. The Company also supports associates through total rewards benefits. As of January 1, 2022, the Company employed approximately 16,500 associates, 10,100 on a full-time basis and 6,400 on a part-time basis. 
 Retention. Attracting and retaining talent is imperative to accomplish the key initiatives of the Company. The Company’s primary initiatives in this area include ensuring a safe and desirable work environment, maintaining a competitive and compelling total rewards offer and investing in leadership and associate development. 
 While the rate of turnover remains high, specifically in the retail and distribution environments, the Company remains committed to reducing turnover, with an established target reduction in the coming year.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The Company celebrates diversity and believes employing a diverse workforce is key to success. SpartanNash is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all individuals regardless of personal characteristics, including but not limited to: race, gender, religion, disability, age, protected veteran status, or any legally recognized status entitled to protection under applicable federal, state or local laws. The Company has a policy that they conduct themselves with dignity and respect each other, and the Company does not tolerate discrimination or harassment. SpartanNash takes action to address and correct disrespectful, inappropriate behavior, unfair treatment, or retaliation of any kind in the workplace or in any work-related circumstance outside the workplace. SpartanNash is focused on ensuring that the rights of women and minority groups are protected and expects all SpartanNash associates to reinforce our People First culture to build a diverse and inclusive workplace. As a commitment to this, all associates are required to complete training on Dignity and Respect, Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination.
 SpartanNash also provides interactive workshops and ongoing training for people leaders, including Bridging the Diversity Gap and Your Role in Workplace Diversity training. To provide associates support and connection within the organization, SpartanNash has associate resource groups available for young professionals, multicultural associates, veterans and women.
 SpartanNash believes that diversity, equity and inclusion drive value for its associates, shareholders and customers. The Company leads with inclusion and strives to create an environment where associates are valued and empowered to support our business objectives, customers and the communities they serve.
 The Company also believes that it is best served by leaders that have diverse perspectives, education, experience, skills, gender, race, and ethnicity as demonstrated by the current executive leadership team and Board of Directors. The Company will continue to seek out such candidates when searching for new leaders and directors. 
 Safe, Healthy and Secure Workplace. The Company’s policies and programs provide a safe and healthy workplace in accordance with all local laws and regulations, in partnership with training to support SpartanNash’s health and safety strategy. Everyone working at SpartanNash is a role model and works together to achieve excellence in everything they do without harm to people, the environment or its communities. Throughout 2021, the Company implemented a new safety program called, “Do Your Part – Be Safety Smart.” The program includes targeted safety goals; the appointment of a safety specialist at all company locations; instituting a safety focus in all team meetings; weekly safety calls with the CEO; development of safety leadership, emergency response, ammonia safety, and safety improvement teams; along with monthly safety reviews by SpartanNash leadership to develop solutions to safety issues and to achieve safety goals.

Associate Engagement and Training. The Company believes that associate engagement and education are key to the full implementation of its Human Rights policy across its footprint. The Company provides role-specific training on human rights and how to recognize, mitigate and act on violations that reinforce their collective commitment to the Human Rights policy.
 Compensation and Benefits. The Company’s total rewards programs are designed to provide compensation and benefits packages that will attract, retain, reward, and inspire its associates to achieve a high level of performance, to challenge convention and turn problems into possibilities. Overall compensation and benefits are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain competitive with respect to industry benchmarks. Significant wage investments were made in 2021 across the retail and warehouse operations to attract and retain associates. Areas of focus for wages were entry level roles across our front-line operations, distribution hourly associates to incent productivity and to address competitive truck driver pay. In line with the Company’s People First initiative, the Company implemented a new paid time off (“PTO”) policy in the fourth quarter of 2021. The new PTO policy provides associates with the same amount of PTO hours in a given year, but with enhanced benefits, which include: greater flexibility on how and when PTO can be taken, immediate new hire eligibility for PTO benefits, ability to elect annual payouts for hourly associates, and an overall simplified policy with one PTO bucket. The Company’s incentive programs are designed to align the associate’s financial interests with that of shareholders and other stakeholders. Eligibility for the annual incentive program was changed in 2021 to include over 1,000 newly eligible associates to allow more associates to share in the success of the Company.
 Environmental Matters
 The Company may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities relating to its stores, warehouses, and other buildings and the land on which they are situated (including responsibility and liability related to its operation of its fuel centers and truck garages and the storage of petroleum products in underground storage tanks). The Company believes that it currently conducts its operations, and in the past has conducted its operations, in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. Also, the Company typically conducts an environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing buildings or raw land. However, the Company cannot always control or predict what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities, and future changes in regulations may result in liabilities to the Company or increases in the cost of doing business.
Regulation 
 The Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the conduct of its business, including those pertaining to the workforce and the purchase, handling, sale and transportation of its products. Many of the Company’s products are subject to federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) regulation. The Company believes that it is in compliance, in all material respects, with the FDA, USDA and other federal, state and local laws and regulations governing its businesses.
