General Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on May 24, 2017, with an objective to operate as is a facilitator of assisted living projects and related services. Our company has positioned itself as a go-to resource for individuals or private groups that wish to enter and operate within the Assisted Living Facility (ALF) industry. Our company’s first target market will be Florida, and will operate within the State through our solely owned subsidiary Assisted 2 Live, Inc. The goal being to use Florida as a test market to streamline our consulting processes and ultimately transition to a national company in the assisted living field. The barriers to entering the ALF space are considerable and require a detailed understanding of each State’s regulatory environment and processes. There is a myriad of steps that must be navigated to properly set up an ALF residence, included, but not limited to licensing, complying with building codes, medical care requirements, staffing and industry regulations. Our company is designed to mentor prospective ALF clients and walk them through every step of the start-up process, working hand-in-hand with them to ensure that their facility gets off to a proper and sustainable start.
 
We have a wholly-owned subsidiary, Assisted 2 Live, Inc., a Florida corporation (“A2L”), which was incorporated on June 15, 2017.
 
On May 31, 2018 and June 6, 2018, we issued 2,300,000 and 750,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to 17 individuals pursuant to the provisions of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Act”) and Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 
During January 2019, we sold 1,100,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-1 filed on August 23, 2018 as amended, which Form S-1 became effective on October 1, 2018. We received $22,000 as proceeds from the sale of the shares.

Our principal executive office is located at 2382 Bartek Pl., North Port, FL 34289 and our telephone number is (888) 609-1169. Our corporate website is www.assisted4living.com.
 
We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.
 
Our Current Business
 
To date, our company has begun to generate initial revenues from our operations.
 
The key philosophy behind A4L is to facilitate the growth of residences that offer a stimulating environment, and provide care that empowers seniors (and young people in specific circumstances) to live an independent and fulfilling life, while attentively being available to take care of their housekeeping, transportation, medical, toileting, dressing and cooking needs.
 
Our company, through the experience of our principal officers, will grow to become a resource for anyone wishing to do business in the ALF field. With Florida as a test market, clients will be guided through every stage of the licensing and structural process required towards establishing an ALF. We will also assist in the operation of a new ALF in conjunction with the owners to ensure that the facilities are established and functioning smoothly, from physical site planning to optimizing care levels and strategies for the various populations in need. 
 
Our company will charge a fee for these services, whereby a prospective ALF operator can choose the specific area of expertise in which they require developmental assistance, and pay according to incremental needs. Clients can simply opt for consultation in licensing, or physical space configuration, staffing requirements and certifications, resident referrals, or other details of the ALF environment. We will offer a full range of choices, from isolated consultations to an option whereby our company will set-up and walk clients through every step of the ALF process, and oversee the project for 6 months to ensure a smooth emergence into the marketplace. 
 
In addition to acting as a facilitator of assisted living projects and related services, we are assessing the viability of acquiring a property and converting it into an assisted living facility. As of now, our company does not own any property, nor do we have any short-term intent to do so.
 
Principal Products, Services and Their Markets
 
A4L is a facilitator of assisted living projects and related services. Our company has positioned itself as a resource for individuals or private groups that wish to enter and operate within the ALF industry. Our company’s first target market will be Florida, and will operate within the State through its solely owned subsidiary Assisted 2 Live, Inc. The target is to use Florida as a test market to better define our consulting processes, and ultimately become a national presence in the assisted living field. The barriers to entering the ALF space are considerable and require a detailed understanding of each State’s regulatory environment and processes. There is a myriad of steps to properly set up an ALF residence, including, but not limited to licensing, building codes, medical care requirements, staffing and industry regulations. Our company is designed to mentor prospective ALF clients and assist them through every step of the start-up process, working with them to ensure that their facility gets off to a proper and sustainable start. 
 
The ALF industry is rapidly growing, and the skewed demographics of the current aging population will only further this industry interest and population need. There are approximately one million seniors in the U.S. who are currently residents of an assisted living facility. The number of potential ALF residents is expected to grow as our aging population reaches the point where they begin to experience declines in their various physical, intellectual, social and mental abilities, and overall health. ALF residences offer people with mild health problems a uniquely supportive environment in which to live, being tailored to provide a ‘home-like’ atmosphere where residents enjoy all their familiar comforts, with the advantage of being in a stimulating social community and not an ‘institutionalized’ feel. Additionally, however, they may also receive supplemental medical supervision and minor medical care, alongside the essentials for daily-living help.

A typical assisted living resident is a senior citizen (mostly 75 years of age and older), who has suffered a mild decline in their health due to illness, injury or general aging. Challenges can range from simple tasks such as bathing or dressing, to more complicated demands such as coordinating home maintenance and issues of safety. However, not all assisted living residents are senior citizens, as at any point in life the onset of acute illness or progressive decline in the younger years in either cognitive or physical ability are ALF candidates, and can greatly benefit from the support in regaining a degree of critical independence. Hence, there is an even broader provider market beyond the senior care with which ALF’s have been traditionally associated. 
 
The key philosophy behind A4L is to facilitate the growth of residences that offer stimulating environments and provide care that empowers seniors (and young people in specific circumstances) to live as independent, while attentively being there to look after their housekeeping, transportation, medical, toileting, dressing, and cooking needs.
 
Our company, through the experience of our principal officers, will grow to become a resource for anyone wishing to get into the ALF field. Clients will be guided through every stage of the licensing and structural process required towards establishing an ALF. We will also operate a newly opened ALF in conjunction with the owners to ensure that the facilities are established and functioning smoothly, working from the ground up on physical site planning to optimizing care levels and strategies for the various populations in need. 
 
Distribution Methods
 
Potential clients will find A4L services through two primary channels: the first is through referrals generated from an informal network of industry contacts, and the second is through a nationally optimized www.Assisted4Living.com website. The website will be optimized for keywords that are related to the assisted living industry. In Florida, the www.Assited2Live.com website will be created and locally optimized to help generate regional business. We will also create on-line Google and Facebook ads that target keywords such as ‘Assisted Living,’ and ‘Assisted Living Facilities’. And in addition to this, the company will look to take out print ads in publications such as AARP magazine. 
Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services
 
A4L has no new publicly announced products or services. 
 
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Assisted4Living’s Position in the Industry
 
A4L will initially compete with other ALF companies that are currently in the Florida market. Large nationally-recognized companies such as Life Care Center of America and Brookdale Senior living would be rivals, as well as smaller regional operators such as South Port Square and Genesis Healthcare. It is possible that new or prospective ALF operators will gravitate to these larger entities for guidance, however, based on the personal history of our company’s officers in the Florida market, we are experienced, connected, and able to compete. We will also compete with these larger firms for prospective ALF residents. While there are established and strong competitors in the Florida ALF market, however, the industry is growing, and we are positioning ourselves to be a niche player as a resource-intensive consulting company providing a highly personalized approach to the ALF marketplace. 
 
While A4L can take on the regulatory and logistical challenges of opening a large ALF center (60 beds+), we are focusing our efforts on smaller, more family-oriented projects (with as few as 4 residents). Keeping an ALF from 4-16 residents can maintain the personal home-style context. We are structuring our consulting approach to target this area and view it as an unrealized niche growth opportunity. The barriers to developing a small-scale ALF project are also significantly less than those for constructing and conforming to the regulatory steps of larger, more industrial-sized projects. 
 
Our company will also pursue the opportunity of starting its own small-scale ALF projects, with the specific goal of creating turn-key start-ups. We will source properties and either lease or purchase them, engage with the Agency of Health Administration (AHCA) for licensing, and make necessary renovations to comply with regulations from agencies such as Emergency Management and the Department of Health. Staff will be sourced and trained, and residents will be found and placed. The concept will be to have a fully licensed, staffed, and populated center that can in turn be marketed to prospective buyers. Interested prospects will be given the opportunity to purchase the business and the property, or simply the business, with the Company keeping ownership of the actual residence.

We are also looking to create a branch of the business that exclusively deals in referrals (seniors that are looking for an ALF). Through our network of industry contacts and the optimization of our digital website, ALF prospects will come to us and can be placed either in our growing network of homes, or, depending upon the needs of the client, be placed in competitor facilities. A typical referral fee of one month’s rent is the industry norm for a qualified referral - and the average monthly rent in an ALF is $3,300. 
 
Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers
 
Our success will depend on the quality of our leadership and their ability to leverage industry knowledge and contacts. Our company will be headed by Romulus Barr, a seventeen-year veteran of the assisted living industry. Mr. Barr has owned and operated an ALF center in Portland, OR, and currently owns a 16-bed facility in Punta Gorda, Florida. The one facility that Romulus currently owns is not operated by him, but rather has been leased to a third party operator. Mr. Barr has a broad understanding of the dynamics on the ALF field, consults on ongoing projects, and developed a standardized ‘Emergency Plan’ that was adopted for use by the State of Florida. Having operated in Florida for the past 10 years, Mr. Barr has developed close relationships with local SW Florida case workers, guardians, and AHCA Florida State regulators. In short, Mr. Barr has a network of industry contacts and a deep understanding of the ALF industry. Mr. Barr hopes to expand this success beyond Florida to other states. 
 
Anca Barr has also worked closely with the Agency for Health Administration (AHCA- Licensing), the Department of Children and Families (case work and resident placements), and the Department of Health (food storage, preparation, and service). Ms. Barr has also worked on a day-to-day basis with ALF centers, and has extensive experience on how to establish centers, care for the residents, manage staffing and budgets, as well as coordinate with medical professionals and regulatory agencies. 
 
Together, both Romulus and Anca provide our company with substantial experience within the industry. 
 
Research and Development
 
Since inception, no funds have been expensed on research and development. There are no extra research or development costs as the principals are donating their time and energy in this start-up phase. 
Employees
 
We have no employees. Initially, our officers and directors furnish their time to the development of the Company at no cost. We do not foresee hiring any employees in the near future. We will engage independent contractors to help design and develop our website and marketing efforts as may be required.
 
Dependence on one or a few major customers
 
A4L will not be dependent on any one customer for our success. Multiple customers and clients will be solicited, and multiple partners sourced to ensure a balanced mix of potential leads. 
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts
 
There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent or trademark. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.
Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements
 
We will be subject to state and local regulation as it pertains to assisted living centers. In Florida, our activities will subject to the approvals and licensing of the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA). AHCA regulates all aspects of owning and operating an assisted living center. This agency is responsible for approving new ALF licenses, regulating existing licenses, enforcing codes, as well as ensuring the proper implementation of Emergency Plans. The Florida Department of Agriculture, Division of Food Safety Amy also regulate our centers, since some of our clients may provide food service, and must comply with safe food standards.

If our clients end up dealing with clients on Medicaid, state case workers will also be engaged and have an impact on our business. Other states have their own regulatory agencies who oversee assisted living facilities, and who will need to be engaged when and if we decide to expand beyond the Florida test market.
