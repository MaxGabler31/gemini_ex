  ITEM 1.  Business
  
 QuantRx Biomedical Corporation was incorporated on December 5, 1986, in the State of Nevada. The Company’s principal business office is located at 10190 SW 90th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97123.
  
  Overview
  
 We have developed and are working towards commercializing our patented miniform pads (“PADs”) and PAD based over-the-counter products for the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, general catamenial uses and other medical needs. We are also developing and intend to commercialize genomic diagnostics for the laboratory market, based on our lateral flow patents. Our platforms include: inSync®, UniqueTM, and OEM branded over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based on the Company’s core intellectual property related to its PAD technology.
  
 The continuation of our operations remains contingent upon the receipt of additional financing required to execute our business and operating plan, which is currently focused on the commercialization of our PAD technology either directly or through a joint venture or other relationship intended to increase shareholder value. In the interim, we have nominal operations, focused principally on maintaining our intellectual property portfolio and maintaining compliance with the public company reporting requirements. In order to continue as a going concern, we will need to raise capital, which may include the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. No assurances can be given that the Company will obtain financing, or otherwise successfully develop a business and operating plan or enter into an alternative relationship to commercialize the Company’s PAD technology.
  
 Our principal business line consists of over-the-counter commercialization of our InSync feminine hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique® Miniform for hemorrhoid application, and other treated miniforms (the “OTC Business”), as well as maintaining established and continuing licensing relationships related to these products. We also own certain diagnostic testing technology  (the “Diagnostic Business”) that is based on the Company’s lateral flow patents. Management believes this corporate structure permits the Company to more efficiently explore options to maximize the value of the Company’s products and intellectual property portfolio, with the objective of maximizing the value of the Businesses for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders.
 
 
 The Company’s current focus is to obtain additional working capital necessary to continue as a going concern, and develop a longer term financing and operating plan to: (i) commercialize its over the-counter products either directly or through joint ventures, mergers or similar transactions intended to capitalize on potential commercial opportunities; (ii) contract manufacturing of its over-the counter products to third parties while maintaining control over the manufacturing process; (iii) maintain the Company’s intellectual property portfolio with respect to patents and licenses pertaining to both the OTC Business and the Diagnostics Business; and (iv) maximize the value of the Company’s investments in non-core assets. As a result of its current financial condition, however, the Company’s efforts in the short-term will be focused on obtaining financing necessary to maintain the Company as a going concern.
  
  Recent Developments
  
 Preprogen Transaction. On December 15, 2017 (“Closing Date”), as earlier contemplated in a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) entered into by the parties on February 27, 2017, the Company executed an agreement with Preprogen LLC (“Preprogen”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to the sale, assignment, and license-back of certain assets of the Company pertaining to its Diagnostic Business (the “Purchased Assets”). Under this agreement, the Company retains all rights and assets relating to the OTC Business, which includes all assets necessary to pursue marketing the over the counter miniform products for female hygiene and hemorrhoid treatment.

 As set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) executed by the parties, as consideration for the sale, assignment and transfer of the Purchased Assets (the “Preprogen Transaction”) on the Closing Date, Preprogen (A) paid to the Company $1.0 million (“Cash Amount”) as follows: (i) approximately $38,000 was paid to the City of Portland to payoff certain indebtedness owed by the Company to the City of Portland, (ii) $65,000 principal amount of  notes held by Preprogen was credited toward the purchase price as a result of the cancellation and termination of those certain promissory notes payable to Preprogen by the Company, which notes were issued to Preprogen in connection with the earlier MOU, and (iii) the remaining balance was paid to the Company in cash at closing (the “Closing Balance”); and (B) issued to the Company that number of membership interests in Preprogen equal to 15% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Preprogen on a fully diluted basis as of the Closing Date. Under the terms of the APA, Preprogen is obligated to pay to the Company such additional amounts calculated based on the aggregate gross revenue generated by Preprogen from the sale of products after the Closing Date that utilize, or royalty payments or licensing fees received by Preprogen with respect to, the Purchased Assets, if any, as more particularly set forth in the APA.
 
 At closing, and as required by the APA, the Company deposited $400,000 of the Cash Balance in escrow, which funds shall be used to fund up to 50% of the costs incurred by Preprogen in connection with the development and manufacturing of materials to be used by the Company for its over the counter miniform products and to be used by Preprogen for diagnostic products related to the Purchased Assets. As additional consideration for the Purchased Assets, the Company issued a warrant to Preprogen’s designee to purchase up to 15.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), at an exercise price of $0.05 per share (the “Warrant”). The Warrant is immediately exercisable and expires on December 14, 2022.
  
 2017 Bridge Notes. In July and August 2017, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements with two existing stockholders, pursuant to which the Company issued convertible promissory demand notes in the aggregate principal amount of $86,000 (the “2017 Bridge Notes”). As additional consideration for the purchase of the 2017 Bridge Notes, the Company reserved for issuance an aggregate of 860,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred”) to be issued to the purchasers of the 2017 Bridge Notes.
  
 The 2017 Bridge Notes accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable in either cash or shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and matured on September 30, 2017. The 2017 Bridge Notes are now payable on demand. Each 2017 Bridge Note is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal balance of the 2017 Bridge Note, plus accrued but unpaid interest (the “Outstanding Balance”), divided by $0.08 (the “Conversion Shares”). Additionally, in the event the Company completes an equity or equity-linked financing with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $1.5 million (a “Qualified Financing”), the Outstanding Balance of the 2017 Bridge Notes will, at the discretion of each respective holder, either (i) convert into securities sold in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) automatically convert into Conversion Shares.
  
  Our Business
  
 Management’s objective is to develop the Company’s innovative PAD based products through genomic testing, although commercialization efforts are conditioned upon securing adequate financing. Assuming the availability of adequate working capital, the Company’s objective is to target significant market opportunities for its products through the following platforms.
 
  PAD/ Health and Wellness  
 
 PAD products are based on the Company’s non-woven disposable absorbent pad technology, with products for aiding the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, the over-the-counter catamenial markets, and other medical needs, including diagnostic sampling products which enable self-collection and worldwide transport for indications such as various cancers, premature delivery, and genomic testing.
  
  Lateral Flow Diagnostics
 
               The Company’s Diagnostic Business is focused on the development RapidSense® point-of-care testing products and and related oral fluid collection technologies based on the Company’s core intellectual property related to lateral flow methods, devices, and processes for the consumer and healthcare professional markets.

  Product and Product Candidates
  
 The Company has historically operated under a two-fold product development strategy: (i) maximize the value of internally developed products that are market-ready for near-term distribution, and (ii) aggressively develop technology platforms for products the Company believes will address medical diagnostic and treatment issues into the future.
  
 When introducing its PAD product lines and other products, the Company sought to align itself with experienced marketing partners that have established distribution channels. The Company teamed with a manufacturing partner in Asia, as well as niche United States manufacturers, in order to bring products to market in an efficient manner while controlling product quality. The Company is currently evaluating new manufacturing relationships in the U.S., consistent with the terms of the Preprogen APA.
   
 
 Our miniform PAD is a patented technology that provides the basis for a line of products that address an array of consumer health issues, including temporary relief of hemorrhoid and minor vaginal infection itch and discomfort, feminine urinary incontinence, catamenial needs, drug delivery, and medical sample collection and transport for diagnostic testing.
  
 The Company’s PAD products for the consumer markets are FDA Class I over-the-counter devices, and are easy to use, non-invasive, fully biodegradable, highly absorbent pads. Additionally, the unique non-woven technology utilized for the PADs allows for a PAD to be used as a sample collection device, providing a sample for diagnostic purposes, or to provide local or systemic therapy.

  Unique® Miniforms
  
 Miniform is a safe, convenient, and flushable technology for the underserved over-the-counter hemorrhoid, feminine hygiene and urinary incontinence markets. The disposable miniform pads contain no adhesives, requires no insertion, and are small enough to fit in the palm of a hand.
  
 The Unique® miniform is available as a treated pad for the temporary relief of the itch and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids and minor vaginal infection, and as an untreated pad, for the daily protection of light urinary, vaginal or anal leakage.
  
 While the Company initiated a limited web-based domestic roll-out of the Unique® miniform, it is in search of a strategic partnership(s) to expand the retail availability of the product across the United States and internationally.
  
  The Company has significant experience manufacturing its miniform and a clear understanding of its costs. The miniform technology is protected by numerous patents covering various applications, the manufacturing process, and certain materials. The Company previously contracted with a firm based in Taiwan to manufacture its PADs, although the manufacturing relationship is currently suspended due to the Company’s financial condition and pending the development of a financing and operation plan that allows the Company to re-commence active operations.
  
  Lateral Flow Diagnostics
  
 The Company developed and patented the RapidSense technology - a one-step lateral flow test with unique features such as a positive indication for a positive test – which allows the Company to target quantified point-of-care (“POC”) diagnostics previously limited to the diagnostic laboratory. These applications include, but are not limited to, thyroid disease, therapeutic drug monitoring, cancer diagnostics, diagnosis of cardiac disease, and other critical tests. This rapid POC diagnostic technology is ideal for testing any body fluid, including whole blood, serum, oral fluids and urine. The Company also patented innovative oral fluid collection devices specifically designed for its RapidSense technology. These distinctive collection devices coupled with RapidSense and the reader platform is intended to ultimately enable us to target the large and growing markets for diagnostics using oral sample collections which have previously been limited to blood or urine testing.
 Competition
  
 Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological changes. Significant competitive factors in our industry include, among others, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products, the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity, manufacturing costs, intellectual property and patent rights and their protection, and sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.
  
 We face, and will continue to face, competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions.
  
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop, which are cleared for sale by the FDA or similar international regulatory authorities in other countries, may compete with similar products currently available or that may become available in the future. Most of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and resources for research, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing and sales. As a result, we may face competitive disadvantages relative to these organizations should they develop or commercialize a competitive product. In addition, given our current lack of working capital, our competitors will have the opportunity to capture market opportunities missed by the Company as we attempt to secure additional financing necessary to commercialize our products.
  
  Raw Materials and Manufacturing
  
 The Company currently does not have manufacturing capacity for any of its products, and therefore has historically contracted for the manufacturing of its products to third-party manufacturers, both in and outside the United States. All manufactured products are produced under FDA mandated Good Manufacturing Practices standard operating procedures developed and controlled by the Company’s quality system, which specifies approved raw materials, vendors, and manufacturing methodology. During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company’s operations were inspected by the FDA and found to be in full compliance.
 Intellectual Property Rights and Patents
  
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had nine (9) patents issued and five (5) licensed patents. Our issued patents expire between 2018 and 2030; however, the Company may obtain continuations, which would extend the rights granted under our issued patents, and additional patents to cover technology in development.  The Company also four (4) registered U.S. and foreign trademarks.

 Patents and other proprietary rights are an integral part of our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and also to rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, our patent positions involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued patents, those licensed to us, and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized, our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization. Expiration of patents we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position.
  
  Licensing, Distribution and Development Agreements
  
 As noted under “Recent Developments” above, on December 15, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Preprogen, pursuant to which the parties agreed to the sale, assignment, and license-back of certain assets of the Company, including rights to use the intellectual property transferred to Preprogen necessary to the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of the Company’s OTC miniform products for the feminine hygiene and hemorrhoid treatment markets.
 Regulatory Requirements
  
 Some of our products and manufacturing activities are, or will be subject to regulation by the FDA, and by other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. Pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, commonly known as the FD&C Act, and the regulations promulgated under it, the FDA regulates the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, advertising and sampling of medical devices and medical imaging products. Before a new device or pharmaceutical product can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through a section 510(k) notification, through a Premarket Approval (“PMA”), or New Drug Approval (“NDA”).
  
 In the United States, medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness with Class I requiring the fewest controls and Class III the most controls. Class I, unless exempted, and Class II devices are marketed following FDA clearance of a Section 510(k) premarket notification. Since Class III devices (e.g., a device whose failure could cause significant human harm or death) tend to carry the greatest risks, the manufacturer must demonstrate that such a device is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting a PMA application. PMA approval by the FDA is required before a Class III device can be lawfully marketed in the United States. Usually, the PMA process is significantly more time consuming and costly than the 510(k) process.
  
 The U.S. regulatory scheme for the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, which includes the targeted molecular imaging agents, can be divided into three distinct phases: an investigational phase including both preclinical and clinical investigations leading up to the submission of an NDA; a period of FDA review culminating in the approval or refusal to approve the NDA; and the post-marketing period.
  
 All of our over-the-counter products derived from the miniform technology, including Unique®, are currently classified as Class I – exempt devices, requiring written notification to the FDA before marketing.
  
 In addition, the FD&C Act requires device manufacturers to obtain a new FDA 510(k) clearance when there is a substantial change or modification in the intended use of a legally marketed device, or a change or modification, including product enhancements, changes to packaging or advertising text and, in some cases, manufacturing changes, to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness. Supplements for approved PMA devices are required for device changes, including some manufacturing changes that affect safety or effectiveness, or disclosure to the consumer, such as labeling. For devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) determinations of substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must obtain FDA clearance of a new 510(k) notification prior to marketing the modified device. For devices marketed with PMA, the manufacturer must obtain FDA approval of a supplement to the PMA prior to marketing the modified device. Such regulatory requirements may require the Company to retain records for up to seven years, and to be subject to periodic regulatory review and inspection of all facilities and documents by the FDA.

 The FD&C Act requires device manufacturers to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. The regulations require that medical device manufacturers comply with various quality control requirements pertaining to design controls, purchasing contracts, organization and personnel, including device and manufacturing process design, buildings, environmental control, cleaning and sanitation; equipment and calibration of equipment; medical device components; manufacturing specifications and processes; reprocessing of devices; labeling and packaging; in-process and finished device inspection and acceptance; device failure investigations; and record keeping requirements including complaint files and device tracking. Company personnel and non-affiliated contract auditors periodically inspect the contract manufacturers to assure they remain in compliance.
  
 Additionally, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). In total, CLIA covers approximately 225,000 laboratory entities. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (“OCSQ”) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program.
  
 The objective of the CLIA program is to ensure quality laboratory testing. Although all clinical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments, CLIA has no direct Medicare or Medicaid program responsibilities. In the event the Company’s current operating plan includes such a facility, it will fall under CLIA regulatory requirements.
  
 Certain of our product candidates will require significant clinical validation prior to obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA. The Company intends to contract with appropriate and experienced CROs (contract research organizations) to prepare for and review the results from clinical field trials. The Company engages certain scientific advisors, consisting of scientific Ph.D.s and M.D.’s, who contribute to the scientific and medical validity of its clinical trials when appropriate.
  
  Research and Development Activities
  
  The Company did not engage in any research and development efforts during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, nor does the Company expect to engage in any research and development activity until funding is secured and we develop a plan to commercialize our products.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2017, we had no employees; however, we have four part-time consultants providing services to the Company in order to maintain the Company as a going concern and to protect our intellectual property portfolio and other assets.
