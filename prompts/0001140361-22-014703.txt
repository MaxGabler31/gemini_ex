Business Introduction/Summary
  We were originally formed on October 8, 2014 as a blank check company under the name Jensyn Acquisition Corp. for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, with one or more businesses or entities. On June 20, 2019, we completed a business combination (the “Reverse Merger and Recapitalization”) pursuant to which we acquired Peck Electric Co. (“Peck Electric”). The Business Combination was a reverse merger treated as a recapitalization and that Peck Electric was deemed the accounting acquirer and takes over the historical information for the Company. Following the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we became known as The Peck Company Holdings, Inc. We conducted all of our business operations exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary, Peck Electric, until January 19, 2021.
 


 
On January 19, 2021, we completed a business combination (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which we acquired iSun Energy LLC (“iSun Energy”). The Business Combination was an acquisition treated as a merger and reorganization and iSun Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of The Peck Company Holdings, Inc. Following the business combination, we changed our name to iSun, Inc. (the “Company”).


On April 6, 2021, iSun Utility, LLC (“iSun Utility”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Adani Solar USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Adani”), and Oakwood Construction Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Oakwood”) entered into an Assignment Agreement (the “Assignment”), pursuant to which iSun Utility acquired all rights to the intellectual property of Oakwood and its affiliates (the “Project IP”). Oakwood is a utility-scale solar EPC company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani. The Project IP includes all of the intellectual property, project references, templates, client lists, agreements, forms and processes of Adani’s U.S. solar business.
 
On September 8, 2021, iSun, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, iSun Residential Merger Sub, Inc., a Vermont corporation (the “Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of iSun Residential, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“iSun Residential”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, SolarCommunities, Inc., d/b/a SunCommon, a Vermont benefit corporation (“SunCommon”), and Jeffrey Irish, James Moore, and Duane Peterson as a “Shareholder Representative Group” of the holders of SunCommon’s capital stock (the “SunCommon Shareholders”), pursuant to which the Merger Sub  merged with and into SunCommon (the “Merger”) with SunCommon as the surviving company in the Merger and SunCommon became  a wholly-owned subsidiary of iSun Residential. The Merger was effective on October 1, 2021.
 
We now conduct all of our business operations exclusively through our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, iSun Residential, Inc., SolarCommunities, Inc. iSun Industrial, LLC, Peck Electric Co., Liberty Electric, Inc., iSun Utility, LLC, iSun Energy, LLC and iSun Corporate, LLC.
 
We are one of the largest solar energy services and infrastructure deployment companies in the country and are expanding across the United States. Our services include solar, storage and electric vehicle infrastructure, development and professional services, engineering, procurement, and installation. We uniquely target all solar markets including residential, commercial, industrial and utility scale customers.
 
 Prior to becoming a public company, we were a second-generation family business founded under the name Peck Electric Co. in 1972 as a traditional electrical contractor. Our core values were and still are to align people, purpose, and profitability, and since taking leadership in 1994, Jeffrey Peck, our Chief Executive Officer, has applied such core values to expand into the solar industry. Today, we are guided by the mission to facilitate the reduction of carbon emissions through the expansion of clean, renewable energy and we believe that leveraging such core values to deploy resources toward profitable business is the only sustainable strategy to achieve these objectives.


The world recognizes the need to transition to a reliable, renewable energy grid in the next 50 years. States from Vermont to Hawaii are leading the way in the U.S. with renewable energy goals of 75% by 2032 and 100% by 2045, respectively. California committed to 100% carbon-free energy by 2045. The majority of the other states in the U.S. also have renewable energy goals, regardless of current Federal solar policy. We are a member of Renewable Energy Vermont, an organization that advocates for clean, practical and renewable solar energy. We intend to use near-term incentives to take advantage of long-term, sustainable energy transformation with a commitment to the environment and to our shareholders. Our triple bottom line, which is geared towards people, environment, and profit, has always been our guide since we began installing renewable energy and we intend that it remain our guide over the next 50 years as we construct our energy future.
 
We primarily provide services to solar energy customers for projects ranging in size from several kilowatts for residential loads to multi-megawatt systems for commercial, industrial and utility projects. To date, we have installed over 400 megawatts of solar systems since inception and are focused on profitable growth opportunities. We believe that we are well-positioned for what we believe to be the coming transformation to an all renewable energy economy. As a result of the completion of the Reverse Merger and Recapitalization, we have now opened our family company to the public market as part of our strategic growth plan. We are expanding across the United States to serve the fast-growing demand for clean renewable energy. We are open to partnering with others to accelerate our growth process, and we are expanding our portfolio of company-owned solar arrays to establish recurring revenue streams for many years to come. We have established a leading presence in the market after five decades of successfully serving our customers, and we are now ready for new opportunities and the next five decades of success.
 
We manage our business through our construction operations and offer our EPC services and products consisting of solar, electrical and data installations. Approximately 88% of our revenue is derived from our solar EPC business, approximately 11% of revenue is derived from our electrical and data business and approximately 1% of revenue is currently derived from recurring revenue of Company-owned solar arrays. Recently our growth has been derived by increasing our solar customer base starting in 2013 and by continuing to serve the needs of existing electrical and data customers. We have installed some of the largest commercial and utility-scale solar arrays in the State of Vermont. Our union crews are expert constructors, and union access to an additional workforce makes us ready for rapid expansion to other states while maintaining control of operating costs. The skillset provided by our workforce is transferrable among our service offerings depending on current demand.
 
We also make investments in solar development projects and currently own approximately three megawatts of operating solar arrays operating under long-term power purchase agreements. These long-term recurring revenue streams, combined with our in-house development and construction capabilities, make this asset class a strategic long-term investment opportunity for us.
 
We have a three-pronged growth strategy that includes (1) organic expansion across the Northeastern United States, (2) conducting accretive merger and acquisition transactions to expand geographically, and (3) investing into Company-owned solar assets.

 Market Overview

We believe that domestic solar capacity and production will experience explosive growth over the short (through 2035) and long (2050) terms. Both short-term and long-term solar production estimates by research groups vary, however even the most conservative estimates project significant growth in domestic solar deployment through 2035 and again through 2050. Current domestic production is estimated at 100GW, and services only 3% of the rapidly growing US electricity demand. According to an October 2021 US DOE Solar Futures Studyi, absent any concerted policy efforts towards decarbonization, domestic solar capacity is projected to increase by 700% by 2050. Modest decarbonization efforts such as those incorporated in the current administration’s ‘Build Back Better’ plan would require cumulative solar deployment to increase much more significantly from current levels - 100 GW serving ~3% of US electricity demand in 2021  to 760-1000 GW serving 37-42% by 2035, an increase of 1150%, according to Solar Power World. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects 270 GW of domestic solar capacity by 2026 – nearly 3x the current domestic production levels. As incentives increase and technology costs fall, the EIA also predicts renewables could account for nearly 60 percent of capacity additions through 2050. S&P Global Market Intelligence’s projections are significantly more aggressive, projecting that domestic production will achieve 87% of the IEA’s 2050 projection within the next 5 yearsii.
 
We agree with the conclusions of the aforementioned reports suggesting that broader decarbonization initiatives involving the decarbonization of the broader U.S. energy system through large-scale electrification of buildings, transportation, and industry will have an impact on both supply (solar deployment) and demand (electricity consumed). The EIA forecasts electricity demand growth owing to electrification of fuel-based building demands (e.g., heating), vehicles, and industrial processes of 30% from 2020 to 2035, and an additional 34% increase in energy demand from 2035 to 2050.
 
While these efforts will further accelerate growth, iSun also concurs with the conclusions of these reports that domestic solar capacity and production will grow regardless of legislative efforts supporting the aforementioned decarbonization efforts. Each report concludes that decarbonization efforts occurring within specific geographic markets and select industries are already underway and are driving demand for additional domestic solar capacity accordingly:
 
Targeted High-Value Geographic Markets: These markets offer:


1.) | A higher internal rate of return (“IRR”) on solar investments,
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


2.) | statewide legislation promoting decarbonization efforts that will in-turn increase electricity demand,
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.) | high concentrations of consumers who are proactively taking steps towards decarbonization by electrifying their homes, appliances, small businesses, and automobiles,
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.) | utilities with a favorable composition of interconnection requests and transmission and distribution capacity.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Targeted Rapidly Growing Industry Sectors: The anticipated widespread adoption of electric vehicles such as the United States  will dramatically change the landscape for domestic energy consumption and production. Mercedes, Ford, and General Motors have all committed to moving to electric or EV hybrid platforms within the decade, ensuring that by 2035, it will be difficult – if not impossible – for consumers to purchase a new car with an internal combustion engine. The average electric vehicle requires 30 kilowatt-hours to travel 100 miles - essentially the same amount of electricity an average American home uses each day. This will have a profound impact on electricity demand across each segment of the marketplace. Overnight, household electricity demand could double for the average American 2-car family. As widespread EV adoption begins to accelerate, consumers will begin looking for ways to reduce their electric bills, increasing demand for household solar solutions. Although consumer behaviors may change with EV adoption…expectations will not. Consumers will still expect that they will be able to recharge their cars quickly and easily at the places they most often frequent. This will in turn prompt commercial enterprises small and large to also look for ways to manage such expectations at reasonable costs. Expectations will be even greater at destination locations such as hotels, municipal facilities, or even remote trailheads or parks, prompting asset owners and municipalities to explore scalable solutions that may not be able to be addressed on-site. And of course, all this activity will in turn be met with an increase in electricity demand, prompting utilities to begin exploring ways of rapidly increasing their capacity.
Strategy
 
iSun is uniquely positioned in the marketplace to address the generational opportunity presented by automotive electrification and decarbonization. iSun’s Solar Platform serves the evolving energy needs and increased energy demands presented by automotive electrification and decarbonization within of each segment of the solar marketplace.

Some of the customer needs that will result from automotive electrification and decarbonization are agnostic to scale and will be universal across all segments. A customer-centric organization, iSun has created cross-division service teams to proactively address these needs. iSun’s:

1. | EV Charging Services provides proprietary, solar-powered charging hardware and software solutions that enable grid-tied or off-grid EV charging.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Development and Professional Services provide solar developers with an a la carte menu of services they can use to help accelerate the development process, and more quickly bring their projects on-line, all without having to scale their operation. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Solar Installation, Operations and Management Services incorporates iSun’s expertise as one of the largest solar contractors into a comprehensive suite of services solar asset owners can use to keep their arrays operating at peak performance levels. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Because we provide services to each segment of the marketplace, our Solar Platform enables us to adapt to the evolving range of customer demand and energy innovations resulting from decarbonization and vehicle electrification.
 
Customer Acquisition: iSun’s growth and new customer acquisition strategies are unique to each division.
 
Residential: SunCommon values high-touch customer service capabilities that foster long-term customer relationships. Our focus ideally suits the contemporary market environment, where recent technologies like EV charging, energy storage and grid management are arriving early and often. The rapid pace of these deployments mean consumers will be looking to enhance their systems more regularly, increasing long-term customer value. We can cultivate and maintain these relationships at an exceptionally low cost. SunCommon reported new customer acquisition costs of $0.36/w for the 12 months ending December 31, 2021.
Commercial: With the addition of an external sales and marketing efforts through the SunCommon acquisition, we are able to leverage this function and support the expansion of our commercial operations. We have historically worked with existing customers and used those long-standing relationships to attract new and repeat customers. As we grow into new geographic areas, we can continue to add commercial projects to our pipeline through a concentrated sales and marketing effort.
Industrial: We continue to experience organic growth from our established relationships with national developers requesting development and EPC services. Additionally, we have made strategic investments in entities capable of providing a robust pipeline of industrial-scale EPC projects. On November 24, 2021, iSun entered into a Membership Unit Purchase agreement (the “MUPA”) with Encore Redevelopment LLC (“Encore”) in exchange for a fully diluted 9.1% ownership interest in Encore. The investment provides for collaboration opportunities across Encore’s robust project pipeline, which is expected to double over the course of the next 12 months with the capital infusion. Additionally, the transaction provides insights into new prospective geographic markets, which can be used to inform iSun’s geographic growth strategy for its Residential and Commercial divisions.
Utility: With the acquisition of Oakwood Construction Services intellectual property, we were able to expand our utility-scale capabilities to include EPC as well as our development and professional services. Unlike EPC services, development and professional services occur prior to the commencement of construction and are not contingent upon a project proceeding to construction status. Development and professional services not only enhance cash-flows and margins on a month-to-month basis, but also afford us the rights to construction services for each project that proceeds to construction, effectively transforming the lead generation funnel for iSun’s Utility Division into a revenue generator instead of an expense. Immediate success of this strategy is demonstrated by contracts for  development and professional services work on 566MW of solar projects across 4 project sites across the US.
Ancillary Markets
 
Our capabilities allow for expansion into high-growth adjacent markets. We began operations as a traditional electric contractor and hold a wide range of capabilities to install electric equipment for a variety of end uses. Today, these core capabilities have developed our business in solar array installation, traditional electric, and data services. We can deploy these capabilities to other large, rapidly growing clean/renewable end market within each segment; namely electric vehicle (“EV”) charging stations, data centers, energy storage and other markets. The rapid proliferation of EV charging stations has followed the shift in auto sales to electronic vehicles, and the EV charging market is expected to expand to over $30 billion by 2024 with a CAGR of 40% over the 5-year period. Energy storage measured by megawatts expanded by 44% year-over-year in 2018 and is projected to grow into a $4.7 billion market by 2024. Both markets represent adjacent, high growth expansion opportunities for us, and both require minimal investment of resources, infrastructure or capital spend given its complementary nature to our existing capabilities.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2022, we employed approximately 325 full-time employees. We may also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing solar systems for our commercial and residential customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor.
 
We have direct access to unionized labor, which provides a unique advantage for growth, because workforce resources can be scaled efficiently utilizing local labor unions in other states to meet specific project needs in other states without increasing fixed labor costs for us.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing options. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs and wants of the customer. Although we do not yet directly provide financing, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources, including SunLight, the Vermont State Employees Credit Union, which offers VGreen financing to maximize solar investment savings.
 
We believe it is best for customers to own their own systems, but some customers prefer not to own their systems. We also have the ability to arrange financing with third parties through power purchase agreements and leases for our customers.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels, inverters and materials directly from multiple manufacturers and through distributors. We intend to further coordinate purchases across all business segments and to optimize supply relationships to realize the advantages of greater scale.
 
If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our supply needs, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and our management believes that we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a number of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.
 
We also utilize strategic companies with subcontractors for electrical installations, for racking and solar panel installations, as well as numerous subcontractors for grading, landscaping, and construction for our commercial, and industrial customers.
 
Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets that we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simple and seamless for its customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.
 


 
Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. There remain jurisdictional approval processes outside our immediate control including, but not limited to, approvals of city, county, state or Federal government bodies or one of their respective agencies. Other aspects outside of our direct control include approvals from various utility companies and weather conditions.
 
After-Sales Support
 
It is our intent to provide continuing operation and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial solar systems. We provide extended factory equipment technical support and act as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy engineering staff. We do this through a 5-year limited workmanship warranty and operations and maintenance program, which among other things, provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours and offer assistance as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. Our price to customers includes this warranty, and also includes the pass through of various manufacturers’ warranties that are typically up to 25 years.
 
Customers
 
Historically, the majority of our revenue came from commercial and industrial solar installations ranging in size from 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts. In 2021, we expanded our capabilities to serve customers across the residential, commercial, industrial and utility markets. We expanded our services based on customer demand to include development and professional services, engineering, procurement, installation, storage, monitoring and electric vehicle infrastructure support.
 
In 2021, approximately 61% of our revenue were in commercial and industrial solar projects, approximately 28% of revenues were generated by residential installations and, 11% of our revenue were from our electrical and data contracts. Approximately 83% of our revenue in 2020 were generated by commercial and small utility solar projects. Approximately 0.5% of revenues were generated by residential installations in 2020. We expect that these percentages will vary from year to year.
 
We believe that we have an advantage in the commercial solar market in Vermont given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the commercial and industrial construction market, which also provides access to customers that trust us. Through our network of vendors, participation in variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to our products. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than we do. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that we are the dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas in which we currently operate. We compete with other solar installers on our expertise and proven track record of performance. Also, pricing, service and the ability to arrange financing may be important for a project award.
Seasonality
 
We often find that some customers tend to book projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. This results in third and fourth quarter sales being more robust usually at the expense of the first quarter. In the future, this seasonality may cause fluctuations in financial results. In addition, other seasonality trends may develop and the existing seasonality that we experience may change. Weather can also be an important factor affecting project timelines.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar EPC business is not dependent on intellectual property. We did acquire the intellectual property of Oakwood Construction Services, LLC which provides proprietary capabilities for development and execution of large utility scale solar projects at a significant value to our customers.
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conducts business.



 
  To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility and we and/or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given. 
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of OSHA, the DOT and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Government Incentives
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable iSun to lower the price it charges customers to own or lease, our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 
The federal government currently offers a 26% investment tax credit (“ITC”) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2022, after which it will fall to 22% in 2023 and 10% in 2024.
 
The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
 
Approximately 50% of states in the U.S. offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a solar energy system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the State from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date.
 
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
 
Governance and Strategic Overview
 
In 2022, iSun is building upon its historic foundation of environmentally and socially responsible business by formalizing an enterprise-level ESG strategy.  This strategy will be overseen by an ESG Executive Committee and guided by the Corporate Governance Committee on the Board of Directors.  Our governance efforts have included developing and publishing a core set of policies that speak to our position on and approach to a range of environmental, social, and governance issues.  Through a stakeholder engagement process and iSun employee interviews, we have identified a set of material issues that are critical to both our business and to our key stakeholders. As such, we have developed policies and are implementing initiatives related to climate change and environmental stewardship, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), labor management and human rights, and stakeholder engagement. We are also formalizing and implementing a Business Code of Conduct as well as a Supplier Code of Conduct.
 
Our strategic plan is designed to mitigate the risks and capitalize on the opportunities associated with these issues, with an explicit focus on aligning our commercial goals and impact aspirations to drive both shareholder and broader stakeholder value.  This strategy will be guided by cross-functional working groups comprised of leaders from across the company and will have explicit goals, key performance indicators (KPIs), and timelines for implementing the initiatives that address each issue.
 
iSun will be focused on integrating, aligning, and scaling the impact programs developed over the years by SunCommon, our recently purchased subsidiary, which is a certified Public Benefit Corporation and recognized leader in the B-Corp world of socially responsible business.

Risks and Opportunities
 
Climate change, and its associated issues like emissions, energy management, waste, and water management – have been identified as critical to our social mission and the concerns of our commercial customers, employees, and investors.  Our mission to accelerate the world’s transition from dirty to clean energy can only be achieved if we are also decarbonizing our own operations and supply chains.  We will be setting long-term goals on climate change and these associated environmental issues after we conduct our first enterprise Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting exercise to determine our scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions.
 
Human capital, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), have been identified as critical to our long-term success and social impact aspirations.  Human capital has become an increasingly important topic for investors and society at large. It is also integral to the long-term success of our business as we rely heavily on our installation teams and the union members we employ. In turn, we will be ramping up our focus on workforce development and upward mobility opportunities for our employees, advancing work opportunities for diverse and at-risk populations, as well as supporting economic inclusion within our supply chains through a minority-owned business procurement program.
 
Governance and corporate transparency, both internally and externally, is another core risk and opportunity to address.  Our revamped ESG governance structure and utilization of the ESG project management platform, ESGProgram.io, will ensure alignment and integration of these efforts across the iSun enterprise.  An internal and external ESG communications plan will also ensure our intentions, efforts, and outcomes are well understood by our external stakeholders and greater operational alignment with our internal teams.  Lastly, we will be providing ESG education to our executive leaders and Board to ensure they can actively contribute to the success of our ESG strategy.
 
Climate Change and Human Capital Management
 
Climate change and human capital management are two leading ESG issues across industries.  From investor expectations to SEC disclosure regulations, climate risk management and human capital management have emerged as the two most critical issues from a stakeholder and general public perspective.
 
Our objectives for climate change include measuring and reducing our emissions, waste, and water, enhancing our operational climate risk resilience, and developing service offerings that support the climate risk resilience of our customers.  We will be setting long-term climate change goals, KPI’s, and timelines for achievement, as well as reporting our progress in a 2022 Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report.
 
Our objectives for human capital management include increasing the diversity of our workforce and procurement partners, creating upward mobility opportunities for diverse employees and field staff, as well as increasing the visibility and importance of the Trades in the communities we live and work.  We will be setting long-term human capital goals, KPI’s, and timelines for achievement, as well as reporting our progress in 2022 with the relevant metrics from the Sustainable Accounting Standards Boards (SASB).
 
Commitments
 
We will be implementing our enterprise ESG strategic plan across our operations.  As our cross-functional working groups get up and running, we will begin our enterprise GHG emissions assessment and develop the internal infrastructure for consistent ESG data collection.  All material issues will be overseen by their relevant functional leaders and will have explicit and quantified goals, KPI’s, and timelines for achievement.  We will be reporting on our progress throughout the year, culminating in a ESG report and complete with a Sustainable Accounting Standards Boards (SASB) and Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reports.  Our progress will be actively communicated externally on our website and in governance documents to ensure full visibility into our ESG intentions, efforts, and results.
