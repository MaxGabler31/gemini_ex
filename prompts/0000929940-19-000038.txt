We have approximately 2,300 customers globally. Our customers consist of companies engaged in the process and other capital-intensive industries such as energy, chemicals, engineering and construction, as well as pharmaceuticals, transportation, power, metals and mining, pulp and paper, and consumer packaged goods.
Industry Background
The process manufacturing industries consist of companies that typically manufacture finished products by applying a controlled chemical process either to a raw material that is fed continuously through the plant or to a specific batch of raw material.
Process industry characteristics and dynamics are complex; therefore, any small improvement in the high-volume feedstocks used, or to the chemical process applied, can have a significant impact on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of manufacturing operations. As a result, process manufacturers, as well as the engineering and construction firms that partner with these manufacturers, have extensive technical requirements and need sophisticated, integrated software to help design, 
operate and maintain complex manufacturing assets. The unique characteristics associated with process manufacturing create special demands for business applications that frequently exceed the capabilities of generic or non-process manufacturing software packages.
Industry Specific Challenges Facing the Process Industries
Companies in different segments of the process industries face specific challenges that drive the need for software solutions that design, operate and maintain manufacturing environments more effectively:
Energy. Our energy markets are comprised of three primary sectors: Exploration and Production, also called "upstream," Oil and Gas Production and Processing, also called "midstream," and Refining and Marketing, also called "downstream":

• | Companies engaged in Exploration and Production explore for and produce hydrocarbons. They target reserves in increasingly diverse geographies involving geological, logistical and political challenges. They need to design and develop ever larger, more complex and more remote production, gathering and processing facilities as quickly as possible with the objective of optimizing production and ensuring regulatory compliance.


• | Companies engaged in Oil and Gas Production and Processing produce and gather oil and natural gas from well heads, clean it, process it, and separate it into oil, dry natural gas, and natural gas liquids in preparation for transport to downstream markets. The number of oil and gas processing plants in North America has increased significantly in recent years to process the oil and gas extracted from shale deposits.


• | Companies engaged in Refining and Marketing convert crude oil through a thermal and chemical manufacturing process into end products such as gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and into intermediate products for downstream chemical manufacturing companies. These companies are characterized by high volumes and low operating margins. In order to deliver better margins, they focus on optimizing feedstock selection and product mix, reducing energy and capital costs, maximizing throughput, and minimizing inventory, all while operating safely and in accordance with regulations.

Chemicals. The chemicals industry includes both bulk and specialty chemical companies:

• | Bulk chemical producers manufacture commodity chemicals and compete primarily on price; they seek to achieve economies of scale and manage operating margin pressure by building larger, more complex plants located near feedstock sources.


• | Specialty chemical manufacturers, which primarily manufacture highly differentiated customer-specific products, face challenges in managing diverse product lines, multiple plants, complex supply chains and product quality.

Engineering and construction. Engineering and construction firms that work with process manufacturers compete on a global basis by bidding on and executing on complex, large-scale projects. They need a digital environment in which optimal plant designs can be produced quickly and efficiently, incorporating highly accurate modeling, analysis and cost estimation technology. In addition, these projects require software that enables significant collaboration internally, with the manufacturer, and in many cases, with other engineering and construction firms.
Companies in the metals and mining, consumer packaged goods, power, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals and biofuels industries are also seeking asset optimization solutions that help them deliver improved financial and operating results in the face of varied process manufacturing challenges.
Complexity of the Process Industries
Companies in the process industries constantly face pressure on margins causing them to continually seek ways to operate more efficiently. At the same time, these manufacturers face complexity as a result of the following:
Globalization of markets. Process manufacturers are continuously expanding their operations to take advantage of growing demand and more economically viable sources of feedstocks. Process manufacturers must be able to design, build and operate plants efficiently and economically while managing and optimizing ever broadening supply chains.
Market volatility. Process manufacturers must react quickly to frequent changes in feedstock prices, temporary or longer-term feedstock shortages, and rapid changes in finished product prices. Unpredictable commodity markets strain the manufacturing and supply chain operations of process manufacturers, which must evaluate and implement changes in inventory levels, feedstock inputs, equipment usage and operational processes to remain competitive.
Environmental and safety regulations. Process companies must comply with an expanding array of data maintenance and reporting requirements under governmental and regulatory mandates, and the global nature of their operations can subject them to numerous regulatory regimes. These companies are increasingly relying upon software applications to model potential outcomes, store operating data and develop reporting capabilities in response to heightened scrutiny and oversight because of environmental, safety and other implications of their products and manufacturing processes.
Evolving Workforce. Process companies must adapt to the changing nature of the technical workforce. A generation of highly experienced plant operators and engineers is nearing retirement.
Market Opportunity
Technology solutions play a major role in helping companies in the process industries improve their manufacturing productivity. In the 1980s, process manufacturers implemented distributed control systems, or DCS, to automate the management of plant hardware. DCS use computer hardware, communication networks and industrial instruments to measure, record and automatically control process variables. In the 1990s, these manufacturers adopted enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems to streamline back office functions and interact with DCS. These systems allowed process manufacturers to track, monitor and report the performance of each plant, rather than rely on traditional paper and generic desktop spreadsheets.
Many process manufacturers have implemented both DCS and ERP systems but have realized that their investments in hardware and back-office systems are inadequate. DCS are only able to control and monitor processes based on fixed sets of parameters and cannot dynamically react to changes in the manufacturing process unless instructed by end users. ERP systems can only record what is produced in operations. Although DCS and ERP systems help manage manufacturing performance, neither of these systems can optimize what is produced, how it is produced or where it is produced. Moreover, neither can help a process manufacturer understand how to improve its processes or how to identify opportunities to decrease operating expenses.
Asset optimization software focuses on the optimum design, operation, and maintenance of the manufacturing process; how the design is optimized for operations and reliability, how the process is operated for optimal economic performance, and how the design and operations impact the longevity and reliability of the equipment. By connecting DCS and ERP systems with intelligent, dynamic applications, asset optimization software allows a manufacturer to make better, faster economic decisions. Examples of how asset optimization software can optimize a manufacturing environment include incorporating process manufacturing domain knowledge, supporting real-time decision making, predicting equipment failure, and providing the ability to respond and adapt to operational changes. Furthermore, these solutions can optimize the supply chain by helping a manufacturer to understand the operating conditions in each plant, enabling more efficient and optimized production decisions.
Process manufacturers employ highly skilled technical personnel specializing in areas such as process design, equipment design, control engineering, manufacturing operations, analytics, planning, scheduling, and supply chain management. To drive efficiency and improve operating margins, these personnel need to collaborate across functional areas and increasingly rely on software to enable this collaboration as well as automate complex tasks associated with their jobs. Process companies must adapt to the changing nature of the technical workforce. A generation of highly experienced plant operators and engineers is nearing retirement. As a result, we believe there is increasing demand for intelligent software applications that capture and automate expert knowledge and are intuitive and easy-to-learn.

We provide integrated asset optimization software solutions designed and developed specifically for the process and other capital-intensive industries. Customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity, reducing operating and maintenance costs, increasing reliability, enhancing capital efficiency, enabling collaboration among different functions and decreasing working capital requirements. Our aspenONE solutions are organized into three suites: 1) engineering; 2) manufacturing and supply chain; and 3) asset performance management (APM):
Engineering. Our engineering software is used to develop process designs of new plants, re-vamp existing plants, and simulate and optimize existing processes.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain. Our manufacturing software is used to optimize day-to-day processing activities, enabling process manufacturers to make better, more profitable decisions and to improve plant performance. Our supply chain management software is designed to enable process manufacturers to reduce inventory levels, increase asset efficiency, respond rapidly to market demands and optimize supply chain operations.
Asset Performance Management. Our asset performance management software is used to understand and predict the reliability of a system; be it multiple assets, a single asset, or equipment in a plant. The factors that impact reliability include how operating conditions degrade equipment performance over time, or how process conditions lead to equipment 
failure, and the ability to predict when the equipment will fail and prescribe actions to avoid such occurrences. The APM suite is a comprehensive suite of machine learning and analytics technologies which, when used in a standalone or integrated manner with historical and real time asset and equipment data, can help our customers improve their return on capital employed.
Our aspenONE licensing model is a subscription offering under which customers receive access to all the products within the aspenONE suite(s) they license, including the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenONE software suite. This affords customers the ability to use our software whenever required and to experiment with different applications to best solve whatever critical business challenges they face.

In addition, our solutions can generate organizational efficiencies and operational improvements that can further increase a process company's profitability.
Growth Strategy
We seek to maintain and extend our position as a leading global provider of process optimization software and related services to the process industries. We have introduced a new strategy to evolve our scope of optimization from the process units in a plant to the process and the equipment in the plant or entire asset. We plan to expand our reach in optimization from conceptualization and design, operations, and supply chain to the maintenance aspects of the plant. We plan to build on our expertise in process optimization, our installed base, and long term customer relationships to expand our reach in the maintenance area of the plant. By focusing on asset optimization, we will be able to optimize the design and operations of a plant considering the performance and constraints of process equipment so as to optimize the full asset lifecycle. Our primary growth strategy is to expand organically within our core verticals by leveraging our market leadership position and driving 
increased usage and product adoption of the broad capabilities in our aspenONE offerings. Additionally, we seek acquisitions to accelerate our overall growth in the design and operations of the process, and acquisitions that will expand our maintenance solution to deliver asset optimization.

The relevance of our solutions in the markets we serve means that we have the opportunity to leverage third parties interested in building or expanding their businesses to increase our market penetration. The breadth of relationships that we establish will depend on the profile of the third-party company and the objectives specified to be achieved from the promotion and implementation of our products and solutions.
Pursue acquisitions. As part of our make-vs-buy analyses, we regularly explore and evaluate acquisitions. We have made several acquisitions in recent years and believe the opportunity exists to do more, especially as we seek to evolve our strategy to asset optimization and the maintenance area of the plant.
Expand our total addressable market. Our focus on innovation also means introducing product capabilities or new product categories that create value for our customers and therefore expand our total addressable market.
Products
Our integrated asset optimization software solutions are designed and developed specifically for the process industries. Customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity, reducing operating costs, enhancing capital efficiency, and decreasing working capital requirements. We have designed and developed our software applications across four principal business areas:
Engineering. Our engineering software applications are used during both the design and the ongoing operation of plant facilities to model and improve the way engineers develop and deploy manufacturing assets. Process manufacturers must address a variety of challenges including design, operational improvement, collaborative engineering and economic evaluation. 
They must, for example, determine where they should locate facilities, how they can lower capital and manufacturing costs, what they should produce and how they can maximize plant efficiency.
Manufacturing. Our manufacturing software products focus on optimizing day-to-day processing activities, enabling customers to make better, faster decisions that lead to improved plant performance and operating results. These solutions include desktop and server applications that help customers make real-time decisions, which can reduce fixed and variable costs and improve product yields. Process manufacturers must address a wide range of manufacturing challenges such as optimizing execution efficiency, reducing costs, selecting the right raw materials, scheduling and coordinating production processes, and identifying an appropriate balance between turnaround times, delivery schedules, product quality, cost and inventory.
Supply Chain Management. Our supply chain management solutions include desktop and server applications that help customers optimize critical supply chain decisions in order to reduce inventory, increase asset efficiency, and respond more quickly to changing market conditions. Process manufacturers must address numerous challenges as they strive to manage raw materials inventory, production schedules and feedstock purchasing decisions effectively and efficiently. Supply chain managers face these challenges in an environment of ever-changing market prices, supply constraints and customer demands.
Asset Performance Management. Our asset performance management products are used to understand and predict the reliability of a system; be it multiple assets, a single asset, or equipment in a plant. Factors that impact reliability include how operating conditions degrade equipment performance over time, or how process conditions can lead to equipment failure. The APM suite is a comprehensive suite of machine learning and analytics technologies which can be used in a standalone or integrated manner with historical and real time asset and equipment data to help our customers predict when the equipment will fail and prescribe actions to avoid such occurrences, thereby improving return on capital employed.
Our software applications are currently offered in three suites: aspenONE Engineering, aspenONE Manufacturing and Supply Chain, and aspenONE Asset Performance Management. These suites are integrated applications that allow end users to design process manufacturing environments, monitor operational performance, respond and adapt to operational changes, predict asset reliability and equipment failure, and manage planning and scheduling activities as well as collaborate across these functions and activities. The three suites are designed around core modules and applications that allow customers to design, operate and maintain their process manufacturing environments, as shown below:

Research and development expenses were $83.1 million in fiscal 2019, $82.1 million in fiscal 2018 and $79.5 million in fiscal 2017.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a value-based sales approach, offering our customers a comprehensive suite of software and services that enhance the efficiency and productivity of their engineering, manufacturing and supply chain and maintenance operations. We have increasingly focused on positioning our products as a strategic investment and therefore devote an increasing portion of our sales efforts to our customers’ senior management, including senior decision makers in manufacturing, operations, maintenance and technology. Our aspenONE solution strategy supports this value-based approach by broadening the scope of optimization across the entire enterprise over its lifecycle, expanding the use of process models in the operations environment, and enabling the use of analytics and data science to enhance equipment and process reliability. We offer a variety of training programs focused on illustrating the capabilities of our applications as well as online training built into our applications. We have implemented incentive compensation programs for our sales force to reward efforts that increase customer usage of our products. Furthermore, we believe our aspenONE licensing model enables our sales force to develop consultative sales relationships with our customers.
Historically, most of our license sales have been generated through our direct Field Sales organization. In order to market the specific functionality and other technical features of our software, our account managers work with specialized teams of technical sales personnel and product specialists organized for each sales and marketing effort. Our technical sales personnel typically have degrees in chemical engineering or related disciplines and actively consult with a customer’s plant engineers. Product specialists share their detailed knowledge of the specific features of our software solutions as they apply to the unique business processes of different vertical industries. In addition to our direct Field Sales organization, we employ an inside sales team that targets customers in certain market segments.
We have established channel relationships with select companies that we believe can help us pursue opportunities in non-core target markets. We also license our software products to universities that agree to use our products in teaching and research. We believe that students' familiarity with our products will stimulate future demand once the students enter the workplace.
We supplement our sales efforts with a variety of marketing initiatives, including industry analyst and public relations activities, campaigns to promote product usage and adoption, user group meetings and customer relationship programs. Our broad user base spans multiple verticals and geographies and these users possess a variety of skills, experience and business needs. In order to reach each of them in an effective, productive and leveraged manner we will increasingly capitalize on digital customer engagement solutions. Using webinars, digital communities, social media, videos, email and other digital means, we 
seek to engage our extensive user base with targeted messages intended to address the specific needs of each market, customer and user.
Our overall sales force, which consists of sales account managers, technical sales personnel, indirect-channel personnel, inside sales personnel, and marketing personnel, consisted of 474 employees as of June 30, 2019.
Software Maintenance and Support, Professional Services and Training
Software maintenance and support (“SMS”) consists primarily of providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades. Customer technical support services are provided throughout the world by our three global call centers as well as via email and through our support website. For license term arrangements entered into subsequent to our transition to a subscription-based licensing model, SMS is included with the license arrangement. For license arrangements that do not include SMS, customers can purchase standalone SMS.
We offer professional services focused on implementation of our solutions. Our professional services team primarily consists of project engineers with degrees in chemical engineering or a similar discipline, or who have significant relevant industry experience. Our employees include experts in fields such as thermophysical properties, distillation, adsorption processes, polymer processes, industrial reactor modeling, the identification of empirical models for process control or analysis, large-scale optimization, supply distribution systems modeling and scheduling methods. Our primary focus is the successful implementation and usage of our software, and in many instances, this work can be professionally performed by qualified third parties. As a result, we often compete with third-party consulting firms when bidding for professional services contracts, particularly in developed markets. We offer our services on either a time-and-material or fixed-price basis.
We offer a variety of training solutions ranging from standardized training, which can be delivered in a public forum, on-site at a customer's location or over the Internet, to customized training sessions, which can be tailored to fit customer needs. We have also introduced a wide range of online computer-based training courses offering customers on-demand training in basic and advanced features of our products directly from within the products. As of June 30, 2019, we had a total of 296 employees in our customer support, professional services and training groups.
Business Segments
We have two operating and reportable segments, which are consistent with our reporting units: i) subscription and software and ii) services and other. The subscription and software segment is engaged in the licensing of process optimization and asset performance management software solutions and associated support services, and includes our license and maintenance revenue. The services and other segment includes professional services and training, and includes our services and other revenue. 
Competition
Our markets in general are competitive, and we expect the intensity of competition in our markets to increase as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profitability and loss of market share. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships also are, or may become, competitors.
Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services, or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. We believe they also have adopted and may continue to pursue more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. For example, some competitors may be able to initiate relationships through sales and installations of hardware and then seek to expand their customer relationships by offering asset optimization software at a discount. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products. Furthermore, we face challenges in selling our solutions to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions.
We seek to develop and offer integrated suites of targeted, high-value vertical industry solutions that can be implemented with relatively limited service requirements. We believe this approach provides us with an advantage over many of our competitors that offer software products that are point solutions or are more service-based. Our key competitive differentiators include:

• | Breadth, depth and integration of our aspenONE software offering;


• | Rapid return on investment and increase in profitability;


• | Domain expertise of chemical engineering personnel;


• | Focus on software for the process industries;


• | Flexibility of our usage-based aspenONE licensing model; and


• | Consistent global support.
