ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Corporate Background
 
Point Capital, Inc. was incorporated under its original name Gold Swap Inc. under the laws of the State of New York on July 13, 2010.  On December 11, 2012, shareholders approved changing the Company’s state of incorporation from New York to Delaware by the merger of Gold Swap with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Point Capital, Inc., and to change the name of the Company from “Gold Swap Inc.” to “Point Capital, Inc.” The merger was effective on January 24, 2013.
 
We are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). As a business development company, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of private U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
 
In addition, we elected to be treated for federal income tax purpose as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or (the “Code”). For 2016, 2015 and 2014, we were treated for tax purposes as a RIC. At March 31, 2017, we determined that we failed the RIC diversification test, since one of our investments accounted for approximately 78% of our total assets. To correct the failure, we needed to dispose of the asset causing the failure within six months of the end of the quarter in which we identified the failure and we would have had to pay an excise tax of $50,000. We did not cure our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we do not intend to seek to obtain RIC status again. Accordingly, we are now subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates.
 
Currently, we are not making any new investments and are considering various options, including liquidation, merging with another BDC or registered investment company or merging with an operating company and withdrawing of our election to be regulated as a BDC.
 
The address of our principal executive office is: Point Capital, Inc., 1086 Teaneck Road, Suite 3A, Teaneck, NJ 07666. Our telephone number is 201-408-5126.
 
We have entered into agreements with U.S. Bank, NA to be the custodian of our portfolio securities.
 
Our transfer agent is Manhattan Transfer Registrar Company, 57 Eastwood Road, Miller Place, NY 11764. Their telephone number is (877) 645-8691.
 
Investment Objective
 
Our investment objective is to provide current income and capital appreciation. We have invested in the common stock, preferred stock, warrants and convertible notes of small and mid-cap companies. Our investments were made principally through direct investments in prospective portfolio companies. Also, we invested in private companies that we believed met our investment objectives.
Competition
 
A large number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we target as part of our business strategy.  We compete for such investments with a large number of venture capital funds, other equity and non-equity based investment funds, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies.  Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may require less information than we do and/or have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than we can.  Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company and, as a result, such companies may be more successful in completing their investments.  There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.
Governance
 
Our Board of Directors monitors and performs an oversight role with respect to our business and affairs, including with respect to investment practices and performance, compliance with regulatory requirements and the services, expenses and performance of our service providers.  Among other things, our Board of Directors approves the appointment of our officers, reviews and monitors the services and activities performed by our officers, and provides overall risk management oversight.

Section 56(a) of the 1940 Act requires that at least a majority of our Board of Directors be composed of independent directors. To be considered independent, a director may not be (i) an officer or employee of the Company, (ii) a direct or indirect beneficial owner of 5% or more of the Company’s voting shares, (iii) an immediate family member of an affiliate of the Company, (iv) any interested person of an investment adviser or principal underwriter to the Company, (v) legal counsel to the Company (or acted as such at any time during the preceding two completed fiscal years) or (vi) a person that has had a material business relationship with the Company at any time during the last two fiscal years. Our current Board of Directors consists of four members, three of whom we consider independent.
 
Our Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is composed of Van Parker, Committee Chairman, Joel Stone, and Leonard Schiller. The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, our systems of internal controls over financial reporting, and audits of our consolidated financial statements, and approval of the engagement, and reviews the performance of, our independent registered public accounting firm
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any intellectual property rights except for our internet website.
 
Employees
 
We currently have no employees and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer provide service on a part-time basis. Our chief executive officer is also a director and our chief compliance officer.  All functions including development, strategy, negotiations and administration are currently being provided by our executive officers or outsourced to service providers. Our officers and directors do not work exclusively for us and do not devote all of their time to our operations. Their other activities prevent them from devoting their full-time to our operations.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
 
From incorporation through December 31, 2013, we were treated as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, we elected to be treated for tax purposes as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Code. As discussed below, since March 31, 2017, we failed the RIC diversification test. As of December 31, 2017 and through the date of this report, we had not cured our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we do not intend to retain our RIC status. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we are subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates. 
 
During the periods we qualified as a RIC, we did not have to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any investment company taxable income (which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses) or any realized net capital gains (which is generally net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized short-term capital losses) that we would have been required to distribute to our stockholders if we would have generated taxable income. We were subject to United States federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any investment company taxable income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. During the periods we were a RIC, we did not generate any taxable income.
 
Since we did not generate investment company taxable income in any taxable years, we were not required to make any distributions to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. We did not generate any realized net capital gains in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and, as a result, we were not required to make any distributions to satisfy Excise Tax Avoidance Requirements. As such, we have not made any provision for federal income or excise taxes as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and 2015.
 
In order to qualify and continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain the tax benefits accorded to a RIC, in addition to satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement, we must, among other things:
 

● | Have in effect at all times during each taxable year an election to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities and (ii) net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded limited partnership” (the “90% Income Test”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


○ | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs) of one issuer, (ii) securities of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or (iii) securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Since March 31, 2017, we failed the RIC diversification test since one of our investments accounted for approximately 78% of our total assets. If we were to correct the failure, we should have disposed of the asset causing the failure within six months of the end of the quarter in which we identified the failure to cure the failure and we would be required to pay an excise tax of $50,000.

As of December 31, 2017 and through the date of this report, we had not cured our failure to retain our status as a RIC and we do not intend to retain our RIC status. Accordingly, beginning in 2017, we are subject to income taxes at corporate tax rates.
 
Regulation as a BDC
 
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than "interested persons," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC without the approval of a "majority of our outstanding voting securities," within the meaning of the 1940 Act.
 
Other
 
We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 
We expect to be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement.  Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
