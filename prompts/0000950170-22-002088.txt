ALASKA COLLECTION

 Pursuit Seasonality
 Pursuit’s peak activity occurs during the summer months. During 2021, 82% of Pursuit’s revenue was earned in the second and third quarters. During 2020, health and travel restrictions including border closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower visitation to all of Pursuit’s properties. During 2021, as pandemic-related restrictions lessened and as people started to feel more comfortable traveling, visitation to Pursuit’s properties improved from 2020. Pursuit’s experiences in the United States saw a strong recovery in visitation primarily from domestic travelers, while tourism in Canada and Iceland remained constrained by border closures and travel restrictions. Canada reopened its border with the United States in early August 2021 to fully vaccinated travelers and to travelers from other countries beginning in September 2021, which accelerated short-term bookings from travelers to our Pursuit operations in Canada.
Pursuit Competition
 Pursuit generally competes based on location, uniqueness of facilities, service, quality, and price. Competition exists both locally and regionally across all four lines of business. The hospitality industry has a large number of competitors and competes for leisure travelers (both individual and tour groups) across the United States and Canada. Pursuit’s competitive advantages are its distinctive attractions, iconic destinations, and strong culture of hospitality and guest services.
 Pursuit Growth Strategy
Pursuit’s growth strategy is to become a leading attractions hospitality company through its Refresh-Build-Buy initiatives:
 •Refresh. Refreshing our existing assets and processes to optimize guest experience, market position, and maximize returns
 •Build. Building new assets that create new guest experiences and additional revenue streams with economies of scale and scope
 •Buy. Buying strategic assets that drive guest experience, economies of scale and scope, and improve financial performance
 We continue to search for opportunities to acquire or to build high return tourism assets in iconic natural and cultural destinations that enjoy perennial demand, bring meaningful scale and market share, and offer cross-selling advantages with a combination of attractions and hotels.
Recent Pursuit Developments
 •Pursuit opened three new world-class attractions in three countries in 2021:
 •On March 18, 2021, we acquired a 60% controlling interest in the Golden Skybridge attraction, which is located in the mountain town of Golden, British Columbia. The Golden Skybridge opened in June 2021. This attraction is part of the Banff Jasper Collection.
 •On April 30, 2021, we opened Sky Lagoon in Reykjavik, Iceland.
 •On September 1, 2021, we opened FlyOver’s newest attraction, FlyOver Las Vegas. 
 •Construction has begun of the Forest Park Hotel, a new 88-room hotel in Jasper, which is scheduled to open in early summer of 2022. 
 •With the goal of expanding our FlyOver attractions to other major tourism markets, we currently have two additional locations in development:
 •FlyOver Chicago, located near the front entrance of Chicago’s Navy Pier, is expected to open during late 2023. 
 •FlyOver Canada Toronto located at the base of the CN Tower in Toronto’s Entertainment District, is expected to open during 2024.

 Service Lines
GES offers a comprehensive range of services and innovative technology for exhibitions/conferences, brand experiences, and venue services.


EXHIBITIONS/CONFERENCES
 GES is a global, full-service strategic marketing and logistics partner for exhibitions and conferences. GES helps clients to easily manage the complexities of their events. GES provides strategy, creative/design, accommodations, official show services, including material handling, rigging, electrical and other on-site services, and audio visual/technology solutions to show organizers and exhibitors. GES assists clients in optimizing show floor presence and sponsorships, and provides data driven solutions to boost revenue.
BRAND EXPERIENCES
 Within the brand experiences service line, GES partners with leading brands around the world to manage and elevate their global experiential marketing activities. GES builds immersive experiences with its clients starting with the strategic plan, creating the content and design, and finishing with the delivery and execution. GES delivers a broad range of unique and impactful experiences for its clients, including corporate meetings and events, digital experiences, brand and sports activations, product launches, strategic exhibition program management, corporate customer centers, consumer pop-up events, on-site services, and audio visual/technology solutions.
VENUE SERVICES
 GES is the in-house audio visual, lighting, rigging, and power service provider of choice to hotels, convention centers, and resorts. With a team of hospitality focused staff, GES supplies on-site scalable production resources and technical AV solutions. Clients range from large venues including the Georgia World Congress, San Diego Convention Center and Metro Toronto Convention Centre to hotel conference centers and resorts.
GES Seasonality and Show Rotation
 GES’ exhibition and event activity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the frequency and timing of shows. Some shows are not held annually and some shift between quarters. Show rotation refers to shows that occur less frequently than annually, as well as annual shows that shift quarters from one year to the next. Starting in mid-March 2020, in-person live event activity was largely cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The live event markets began to re-open in 2021 with smaller scale live events starting to take place during the first half of the year. During the second half of 2021, we began to see an acceleration in the recovery of in-person trade shows as event organizers began to hold larger-scale face-to-face live events.
GES Competition
 In the live events industry, GES generally competes across all classes of services and all markets on the basis of discernible differences, value, quality, price, convenience, and service. GES has a competitive advantage through its worldwide network of resources, history of serving as an extension of clients’ teams, experienced and knowledgeable personnel, client focus, creativity, reliable execution, proprietary technology platforms, and financial strength. All known United States competitors and most international competitors are privately held companies that provide limited public information regarding their operations. GES’ primary competitor within its exhibitions and conferences is a privately-held, United States-headquartered company; however, there is substantial competition from a large number of service providers in GES’ other service offerings.
GES Transformation Strategy
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our transformation and streamlining efforts at GES to significantly reduce costs and create a lower and more flexible cost structure focused on servicing GES’ more profitable market segments. In 2020, GES exited 21 leased facilities across its warehouse and office network and sold its San Diego area production warehouse. In 2021, GES sold its Orlando area production warehouse. As additional leases come to an end at other facilities, GES will continue to evaluate its physical presence and look for additional opportunities to improve its cost structure. Additionally, GES outsourced capital-intensive services by closing its United Kingdom-based audio-visual services business, which will now be serviced by third parties in the United Kingdom, and outsourced the management, cleaning, and storage of aisle carpet in the United States. GES has partnered with a third-party staffing agency to roll out an industry-wide Flex Talent Pool program. Through this program, GES can offer flexible and temporary work opportunities for exhibition professionals as business operations return, while managing its costs.
 Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights (including trademarks, patents, copyrights, registered designs, technology, and know-how) are material to our business.
We own or have the right to use numerous trademarks and patents in many countries. Depending on the country, trademarks remain valid for as long as we use them, or as long as we maintain their registration status. Trademark registrations are generally for renewable, fixed terms. We also have patents for current and potential products. Our patents cover inventions ranging from a modular structure having a load-bearing surface that we use in our event and exhibition services, to a surface-covering installation tool and method that reduces our labor costs and improves worker safety. Our United States issued utility patents extend for 20 years from the patent application filing date, and our United States issued design patents are currently granted for 14 years from the grant date. We also have an extensive design library. Many of the designs have copyright protection and we have also registered many of the copyrights. In the United States, copyright protection is for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter. While we believe that certain of our patents, trademarks, and copyrights have substantial value, we do not believe the loss of any one of them would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Government Regulation and Compliance
The principal rules and regulations affecting our day-to-day business relate to our employees (such as regulations implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, equal employment opportunity laws, guidelines implemented pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and general federal and state employment laws), unionized labor (such as guidelines imposed by the National Labor Relations Act), United States and Canadian regulations relating to national parks (such as regulations established by Parks Canada, the United States Department of the Interior, and the United States National Park Service), United States and Canadian regulations relating to boating (such as regulations implemented by the United States and Canadian Coast Guard and state boating laws), and transportation (such as regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and its state counterparts).
 Our current and former businesses are subject to federal and state environmental regulations. Compliance with these provisions, and environmental stewardship generally, is key to our ongoing operations. To date, these provisions have not had, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our results of current and discontinued operations.
On July 18, 2020, an off-road Ice Explorer operated by our Pursuit business was involved in an accident while enroute to the Athabasca Glacier, resulting in three fatalities and multiple other serious injuries. We continue to support the victims and their families, and we are fully cooperating with the applicable regulatory authorities to investigate this accident.
Human Capital
Our business strategy focuses on providing superior experiential services to our customers to generate financial results that create attractive returns on invested capital to our shareholders. We employ the highest quality individuals who embody our values, provide innovative leadership, and deliver superior guest experiences and client services. We are committed to providing great places to work that are diverse and inclusive, creating safe and environmentally conscious experiential services, and giving back to our communities.
 We had the following number of employees as of December 31, 2021:
 

 | Number ofEmployees (1) | 
GES | | 2,058
Pursuit | | 1,423
Viad Corporate | | 31 
Total | | 3,512

 (1)Includes 620 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and excludes seasonal or temporary employees. The employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are largely used to staff GES’ shows, events, and production facilities pursuant to business demands. We believe that relations with our employees are good and that collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2022 will be renegotiated in the ordinary course of business without adverse effects on our operations.
 We are governed by a Board of Directors comprising eight non-employee directors and one employee director, and we have an executive management team with six executive officers.
 GES hires temporary employees on a show-by-show basis, including operations and exhibitor service positions. The number of temporary employees fluctuates depending on the size and location of the exhibition or event. Pursuit hires approximately 2,000 seasonal employees during the peak summer months to help operate its attractions and hospitality properties.
 Safety and well-being:
The safety and well-being of team members, clients, and guests is a leading core value. We believe that maintaining strong standards of health and safety improves employee productivity and operational efficiency and enhances employee well-being.
Our employees have a responsibility to maintain a safe and healthy work environment. We take prompt action to correct unsafe or hazardous conditions; we promptly report work-related accidents and injuries in accordance with established procedures; we follow all established work rules related to safety; we ensure that our workers understand the risks, know how to handle hazardous products safely,

and are familiar with available information for all hazardous materials used. In response to mitigating the spread of the COVID-19 virus, we implemented enhanced health and safety protocols including employees working from home and additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Our Experience Modification Rating assigned by the National Council on Compensation Insurance was 0.82 as of December 31, 2021 and 0.77 as of December 31, 2020, which are considered ratings of better than average.
 Both Pursuit and GES have implemented business-specific programs that support our commitment to the safety and well-being of our team members, clients, and guests. Through Pursuit’s Safety Promise, we ensure that our team members and guests feel safe at our experiences and that these places can continue to make a positive impact. GES’s Always On Health and Safety Program was designed by our safety team to protect our employees, customers, partners, and event attendees and provide safe and reliable delivery of events.
Compliance and ethics:
 As leaders in the live event and adventure travel industries, we uphold and are dedicated to being a responsible corporate citizen and a good steward of our environment. This is reinforced every day in our businesses through our Always Honest Compliance and Ethics Program. Our Always Honest Program was established in 1994 and is our guide to operating with integrity. The Always Honest Program guides our employees in conducting themselves on behalf of the Company, with each other, and with everyone the Company partners with. It guides employees to act honestly, ethically, and always in compliance with the law. We believe that maintaining a culture of high ethical standards gives us a distinct advantage in recruiting and retaining top talent, driving the best value for our customers, and attracting shareholders.
Community involvement:
 Giving back to the community is very important to us. We are committed to making a positive impact within the communities we serve through educational programs such as GES’ Exhibition Sponsorships, volunteer services, and environmental/economic sustainable efforts in the community. Many of our offices pull together to volunteer and support local and national organizations. For example, Pursuit was the first corporate donor to Banff Canmore Community Foundation’s “Funding the Future” campaign reinforcing our commitment to the Bow Valley community. Also, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of Pursuit’s operations, Pursuit quickly developed an at-cost, ready-made meal program for its staff and community members in Banff and Jasper. Led by Pursuit’s food and beverage team and staffed by volunteers from across its operations, more than 20,000 takeaway meals were served to the communities.
 Diversity, equity, and inclusion:
We believe diversity and gender equality are critical to building a thriving workplace. We strive to create an environment where people of all different backgrounds feel a sense of belonging and contribute to our continued success. To make our workplace as inclusive and safe as possible, we have diversity and inclusion training integrated into our Always Honest Compliance and Ethics Program.
 We do not discriminate against employees or applicants based on race, color, age, disability, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, genetics or genetic information, or any other categories protected by law. We are committed to equal opportunity in all of our employment activities, including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, compensation, determination of benefits, training, promotion, and discipline. We also provide reasonable accommodations to disabled persons, so all employees can achieve success in the workplace.
We take pride in the diverse and talented group of people that make up our Board of Directors, executive management team, and employees. We understand the value that a diverse workforce of varying genders, ethnicity, background, and experience brings to the Company and we are focused on improving diversity at all levels. With our recent appointment of Beverly K. Carmichael to our Board of Directors, we now have three female Board members out of a total of eight non-employee Board members. In 2021, more than 40% of our overall global workforce were female.
As a devoted steward to our communities, we are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce to better reflect the communities in which we operate. We have undertaken initiatives, which go beyond legal compliance, to recruit from diverse audiences, such as minorities, veterans, and women. These efforts include leveraging inclusive job-posting sites and sharing job postings with community partners.
 As part of our commitment to developing our employees and furthering their professional growth, we have mentorship programs in place, including our Sales Leadership Program. This program connects new hires, which are recent graduates, with leaders within our organization and is designed to accelerate their career trajectory.
Our emphasis on equality permeates throughout the organization and helps drive our success. For example, Pursuit conducted its first diversity, equity, and inclusion survey in 2020. Pursuit’s Promise to People census was designed to help us understand, recognize, and

respect the diversity we have within our team. The key learnings from this voluntary survey shaped our training and development plans for 2022 and beyond.
Rewards and performance management:
Beyond a competitive salary, we offer a range of healthcare benefits to full-time employees, their spouses, and dependents. We encourage our employees to grow professionally with ongoing training and internal career opportunities. We utilize a performance management cycle, which provides a framework designed to maximize performance and cultivate talent. Salary increases are based on merit. Short- and long-term incentive compensation for senior managers and executives is based on the Company’s performance and/or stock performance.
 Impact of COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly, with a high concentration of confirmed cases in the United States and other countries in which we operate. Starting in mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant and negative impact on our operations and financial performance, with severe disruptions in live event and tourism activity. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (Part II, Item 7 of this 2021 Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 2021 financial results.
Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of COVID-19, and depending on the success of ongoing vaccination and other mitigation efforts as well as the scope and magnitude of infections and hospitalizations, we are not able at this time to fully estimate the effect of these factors on our business; however, the adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and cash flows has been significant. Refer to “Risk Factors” (Part I. Item 1A of this 2021 Form 10-K) for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business.
