Corporate History and Background 
 We were initially formed on December 19, 2018 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. From the time of our formation to the time of the consummation of the Business Combination, our name was “LifeSci Acquisition Corp.” 
 On September 25, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement. At the effective time of the Merger, each share of Legacy Vincera Pharma Common Stock, other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement), was canceled and the Legacy Holders received (i) 0.570895 shares of our common stock, for each share of Legacy Vincera Pharma Common Stock held by them immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (ii) certain rights to additional shares of our common stock, or Earnout Shares, after the closing of the Business Combination. 
 The Legacy Holders are entitled to receive Earnout Shares after the closing of the Business Combination if the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock equals or exceeds the following prices for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading-day period, or the Trading Period, following the closing of the Business Combination: (1) during any Trading Period prior to the forty-two (42) month anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, upon achievement of a daily volume-weighted average price of at least $20.00 per share, such number of shares of our common stock as equals the quotient of $20.0 million divided by the Closing Price Per Share (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (2) during any Trading Period prior to the six year anniversary of the closing, upon achievement of a daily volume-weighted average price of at least $35.00 per share, such number of shares of our common stock as equals the quotient of $20.0 million divided by the Closing Price Per Share; and (3) during any Trading Period prior to the eight year anniversary of the closing, upon achievement of a daily volume-weighted average price of at least $45.00 per share, such number of shares of our common stock as equals the quotient of $20.0 million divided by the Closing Price Per Share. A total of 90.6% (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the Earnout Shares then earned and issuable shall be issued to the Legacy Holders on a pro-rata basis based on the percentage of the number of shares of Legacy Vincera Pharma Common Stock owned by them immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, and the remaining Earnout Shares that would otherwise have been issuable shall not be issuable to the Legacy Holders but in lieu thereof the number of authorized shares available for issuance under the Vincerx Pharma, Inc. 2020 Stock Incentive Plan shall be automatically increased by an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. 
 The aggregate value of the shares of our common stock received by the Legacy Holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement was $55.0 million and the aggregate value of Earnout Shares that the Legacy Holders are eligible to receive, subject to certain conditions, is an aggregate of up to $60.0 million. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on leveraging our extensive development and oncology expertise to advance new therapies intended to address unmet medical needs for the treatment of cancer. Our current pipeline is entirely derived from the Bayer License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under certain Bayer patents and know-how to develop, use, manufacture, commercialize, sublicense and distribute a clinical-stage and follow-on small molecule drug program and a preclinical stage bioconjugation platform, which includes next-generation antibody-drug conjugates and innovative small molecule drug conjugates. We intend to use these product candidates to treat various cancers in a patient-specific, targeted approach. We believe that these product candidates are differentiated from current programs targeting similar cancer biology, and, if approved, may improve clinical outcomes of patients with cancer. Certain of the references in this report to preclinical and 
 
6 

  clinical studies regarding the Bayer assets refer to preclinical and clinical studies conducted by Bayer or other third parties before we in-licensed these assets. 
 Despite several decades of advances in targeted therapies, cancer continues to be the second leading cause of death in the United States population per the National Center for Health Statistics. Cancer is not a single disease but rather a constellation of maladies with each requiring a unique approach to vanquish it. Our vision is to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer with a diverse pipeline of targeted medicines. The small molecule drug program includes VIP152 (formerly known as BAY 1251152), which is a highly selective, clinical-stage PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor. VIP152 may deliver value-generating data in the 2022. Our ADC platform includes VIP943 (formerly known as BAY-943) and VIP924 (formerly known as BAY-924), which are next-generation ADC compounds addressing known and novel oncology targets that we believe could deliver a greater safety and efficacy profile than current ADC compounds. The bioconjugation program also includes VIP236, which is an SMDC for solid tumors. In addition to our lead products, we acquired the rights to additional product candidates that are still in the preclinical stage (e.g., VIP217, a follow-on PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor). 
 PTEFb is an intracellular protein composed of two subunits, CDK9 and Cyclin-T. CDK9 is a transcriptional kinase that plays a central role in one of the processes that cancer cells use to survive and thrive: increased expression of cancer-promoting genes. Therapeutics directed at targeting CDK9 and the PTEFb complex have often been hindered by inhibition of alternative targets in the CDK family. These non-CDK9 targets diminish the therapeutic window of this drug class. Our lead product candidate, VIP152, is a potent and highly selective CDK9 inhibitor optimized for intermittent intravenous treatment, which (by decreasing activity of this kinase) disrupts PTEFb function. VIP152 has shown target modulation and preliminary signs of clinical activity in Phase 1, notably in patient populations with high unmet medical needs, which could lead to breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval for marketing in multiple indications in the United States. 
 Our SMDC platform targets advanced solid tumors with an optimized camptothecin, a potent cytotoxin (i.e., warhead, payload or toxophore). The warhead is designed to be released in the tumor stroma. Our most advanced SMDC (VIP236) has shown preclinical proof-of-concept across various in vivo human tumor models in mice. 
 Antibody-drug conjugates are an established therapeutic approach in oncology used to selectively deliver potent cytotoxins directly to tumor cells, with the goal of maximizing toxicity in tumor cells, while minimizing toxicity to healthy cells. The antibody component is designed to selectively bind to a distinct antigen preferentially expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding to the antigen, most ADC molecules are internalized by the cancer cell wherein the payload is released, causing cell death. Our next-generation ADC platform was engineered to specifically address efficacy and toxicity issues associated with currently approved ADCs. For example, our ADC platform has several key innovations regarding the linker (i.e., the chemical structure attaching the warhead to the antibody) and the warhead. Once our ADCs are internalized, our unique linker is specifically cleaved by an enzyme called legumain. Legumain activity is elevated in cancer versus healthy cells, thereby preferentially targeting release of the warhead in cancer cells. In addition, our ADC platform is the first to use a KSPi as a payload to kill rapidly dividing cells. In clinical trials, KSPis that were administered systemically were found to be very toxic to rapidly dividing normal cells, such as blood and gastrointestinal cells; as such, they had a narrow therapeutic window, between killing normal versus cancer cells. By attaching our KSPi to antibodies directed against proteins found on cancer cells (e.g., CD123 and CXCR5), we increase the therapeutic window by selectively targeting tumor versus healthy cells. In addition, our KSPi is chemically designed to be impermeable to cell membranes. This innovation, referred to as the “CellTrapper™,” increases the potency in cancer cells by trapping the warhead within the cancer cell. Once the cancer cell dies, the CellTrapper prevents entry of the warhead into neighboring normal cells, thus reducing unwanted toxicity. We believe this combination of innovative technologies (i.e., antibody target; legumain-cleavable linker; KSPi and its CellTrapper) has the potential to significantly minimize the side-effects and improve the therapeutic benefit of ADCs. Toxicity of ADCs to normal cells has been a major limitation, thus far, for the optimization of this therapeutic drug class. This platform, once validated, offers the potential for application with other tumor-specific therapeutic antibodies.

  Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to develop multiple products through clinical proof-of-concept and potentially through accelerated approval in the United States. Our near-term objectives are to: 
 

• | Continue the clinical development of our small molecule drug inhibitor (VIP152) as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents in Phase 1, including expansions in patients with hematologic (e.g., double-hit DLBCL; transformed follicular lymphoma; Richter syndrome; chronic lymphocytic leukemia relapsed or refractory to any BTK inhibitors and venetoclax; and mantle cell lymphoma) and solid tumors (e.g., ovarian, triple negative breast cancer, and castration resistant prostate cancer) to obtain clinical proof-of-concept in indications with unmet medical needs (and, by definition, potential accelerated approval indications).

Our Product Candidate Pipeline 
 


Small Molecule Drug Program—PTEFb 
 VIP152 is a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, which disrupts the function of PTEFb, is designed to be administered intravenously and is in Phase 1 studies in patients with advanced cancer. VIP152 has broad intellectual property protection with exclusivity for composition of matter until at least 2033, plus potential extensions. 
Scientific Overview of Oncogenes and Transcriptional Regulation in Cancer 
 Oncogenes (i.e., genes that drive cancer) are induced by mutations of normal genes that result in the loss of normal cell-growth control and lead to the formation of cancers. Expression of these oncogenes often requires dysregulation of transcription (i.e., the biologic process by which genes are activated or regulated) and has been termed “transcriptional addiction.” Therefore, agents that can target the transcriptional machinery active in cancer cells may have significant utility in treating patients with cancer. Cyclin dependent kinases such as CDK7 
 
8 

  and CDK9 control transcriptional initiation and elongation, respectively, suggesting that inhibition of these regulators of transcriptional activity may be very effective in controlling cancer. CDK9 also has recently been shown to phosphorylate BRG1 and inhibition of this kinase may have a role in re-expressing tumor suppressor genes silenced by epigenetic mechanisms in cancer. 
 The first-generation CDK inhibitors developed were relatively nonspecific and are often referred to as ‘pan-CDK’ inhibitors (e.g., flavopiridol and seliciclib) and also had non-CDK targets. Although these pan-CDK inhibitors showed great promise in preclinical models, they have proven to have a narrow range of doses that produces therapeutic response without causing significant adverse effects (i.e., narrow therapeutic index) in patients in clinical trials. After the generally disappointing results seen in clinical trials with non-selective CDK inhibitors, the importance of selectivity of compounds for specific CDKs; absence of alternative targets; and patient selection is now widely accepted. For example, three different CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib, palbociclib and ribociclib) are now approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. To date, no drugs specifically targeting CDK9 have been approved. However, there are several drugs in clinical trials targeting CDK9 such as dinaciclib, AZD5473, CYC065, KB-0742, alvocidib (formerly flavopiridol) and voruciclib. With regard to stage of clinical development, dinaciclib was evaluated in a Phase 3 trial of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and demonstrated clinical activity, but did not complete registration studies due to program prioritization decisions by Merck & Co, Inc. Alvocidib (pan-CDK inhibitor) has been evaluated in Phase 2 trials in AML and has shown signs of clinical activity. VIP152 was designed to be a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor compared with other agents currently in clinical trials. We believe a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor will have a better therapeutic index than less selective inhibitors. 
 PTEFb/CDK9: A Potential Target for Oncology 
 PTEFb is an intracellular protein composed of two subunits, CDK9, which is a transcriptional CDK, and Cyclin T. PTEFb is a key regulator of RNA polymerase II transcription (as depicted below). Transcription is the process by which the information in a strand of DNA is copied into a new molecule of mRNA. mRNA is then translated into proteins, which are the work horses of most cellular processes. 
 The inhibition of CDK9, and therefore PTEFb, blocks this transcription process and leads to the reduction of important cancer-driving proteins, such as MCL1 and MYC, which are oncogenes (i.e., DNA sequences that drive cancer) transcribed by RNA polymerase II. MCL1 is a member of the family of proteins that when elevated, may prevent the cell from undergoing cell death, otherwise knowns as anti-apoptotic proteins. MYC is a transcription factor regulating cell proliferation and growth that contributes to many cancers and is frequently associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable patient survival. 
 To date MCL1 and MYC proteins have not been successfully targeted directly. Both oncogenes have been found to be drivers of several malignancies across solid tumors (e.g., triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer) and blood cancers (e.g., double-hit DLBCL). Blocking the transcription of MCL1 and MYC is an indirect way of blocking the activity of MCL1 and MYC by essentially shutting down the production of the proteins at inception. 
 Our lead small molecule drug candidate, VIP152, is designed as a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, as shown below, designed to be administered intravenously. VIP152 binds to and blocks the phosphorylation activity of CDK9, thereby preventing PTEFb-mediated activation of RNA polymerase II and leading to the inhibition of transcription of various oncogenes. We believe this will cause cell death, which may lead to a reduction in tumor cell proliferation. VIP152 is in Phase 1 trials in patients with advanced cancer. In addition to the intravenous VIP152 molecule, we licensed from Bayer a follow-on oral molecule (VIP217), which is in the discovery stage. 
 The table below summarizes key in vitro features of VIP152. VIP152 inhibits CDK9 at low nanomolar concentrations even in presence of high ATP levels. In contrast, VIP152 does not inhibit other CDKs or kinases 
 
9 

  at physiologically relevant concentrations, except possibly IRAK1 and GSK3-alpha. When evaluated in a panel of 33 tumor cell lines, the median IC50 was 67 nM, suggesting broad anti-tumor activity.

Preclinical Results 
 VIP152 Pharmacodynamics in a Multiple Myeloma Mouse Xenograft Model
The pharmacodynamic activity of VIP152 was assessed as a single-drug therapy (i.e., monotherapy) in mice implanted with human multiple myeloma tumors. In this study, a single dose of VIP152 was administered intravenously. After administration, a rapid reduction of MCL1 and MYC mRNA levels and a durable reduction of MYC protein levels were observed, which ultimately induced tumor cell death as marked by increases in processed caspase-3 and down-stream target cleaved PARP (i.e., markers of cell death by apoptosis).

  VIP152 Activity MYC Expressing DLBCL Cell Lines 
 Inhibition of CDK9 results in inhibition of RNA Polymerase II phosphorylation at the Ser2 residue (phospho-Ser2). The figure shows VIP152 inhibits phosphor-Ser2 for 24 to 48 hours compared with <24 hours of inhibition for two other CDK9 inhibitors, atuveciclib and KB-0742.In Vitro Study Evaluating 3 CDK9 Inhibitors (VIP152, atuveciclib & KB-0742)
in MYC Expressing DLBCL Cell Lines 
 


In these cell lines, VIP152 at 1 µM also delivered sustained MYC and MCL1 protein depletion for 48 hours which translated into higher cell kill than observed with the same concentrations of atuveciclib or KB-0742.
The anti-cancer activity of VIP152 was assessed as a monotherapy in a mouse subcutaneous model of double-hit DLBCL. In this study, once weekly doses of VIP152 were administered intravenously. After administration, tumor regression was observed as shown below:

Clinical Trials 
 Study 18117: VIP152 Dose-escalation Study in Relapsed/ Refractory Leukemia 
 VIP152 was previously evaluated in an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study, which intended to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetics and MTD of VIP152 in patients with 
 
11 

  advanced hematologic malignancies. Such study was completed early with only 21 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated (dose levels 5 to 30 mg; 21-day cycles; 30-minute infusions) due to inadequate monotherapy activity in an unselected AML patient population. A similar safety profile was observed across each of the four dose levels, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported—the most common adverse events included gastrointestinal side effects and cytopenia. No patients with other hematologic malignancies were included (e.g., CLL or MDS). Future studies for the treatment of leukemia will focus on select patient populations and mechanistic-directed combination strategies relevant for accelerated approval. 
 Study VNC-152-101 (Formerly Study 17496): Target Validation and Early Clinical Signs of Efficacy 
 VIP152 is also being evaluated in an ongoing open-label Phase 1 dose-escalation study, which we refer to as Study VNC-152-101, designed to evaluate VIP152 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors), including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, after failure of prior standard therapies to determine the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and MTD. As the trial is ongoing, none of the results summarized below are considered statistically significant. 
 Initial results from Study VNC-152-101 suggest that single agent VIP152 has a manageable safety profile, apparent dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and on-target pharmacodynamic activity. VIP152 has demonstrated tolerable side effects and a rapid reduction in MCL1 and MYC mRNA in peripheral blood cells. The initial signs of clinical benefit include: 
 

• | Durable disease control was observed in individual patients with pancreatic cancer and salivary gland cancer (9.5 and 16.8 months of treatment, respectively).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Of 7 patients with double-hit DLBCL treated with VIP152 30 mg once weekly, 2 patients had complete metabolic remissions (CMR); both achieved CMR after 10 cycles. When treatment ended due to the COVID pandemic (i.e., patients had been in long remission and did not want to risk COVID infection at the hospital), both were still in CMR. One had been receiving treatment for 3.7 years and the other for 2.3 years. As of the end of 2021 both remained in remission nearly 1 year after stopping treatment with VIP152.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Study VNC-152-101 enrolled 31 patients in the dose escalation portion of the study, then an expansion cohort for double-hit DLBCL was opened (n=6). We have taken over the IND for VIP152 and have amended the Study VNC-152-101 protocol to add new cohorts, and are enrolling patients. 
 Double-hit DLBCL is a rare, aggressive (fast-growing) type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma caused by changes in the DNA that affect the MYC gene and either the BCL2 or BCL6 gene. Double-hit DLBCL is hard to treat and has a poor prognosis with a median progression-free survival of 11 months and median overall survival from diagnosis of 22 months. No standard treatments are currently approved for double-hit DLBCL, representing a population with an unmet medical need. Expansions in other tumor types driven by MYC and/or MCL1 are in planning. 
 VIP152 has demonstrated tolerable side effects in dose escalation. In the dose escalation study, no treatment-related serious adverse events or deaths were observed; however, two treatment-emergent deaths occurred that were unrelated to VIP152. A total of 14 subjects experienced serious AEs: abdominal pain (three patients), dyspnea (two patients), hepatorenal syndrome, cholangitis, mastitis, device-related infection, sepsis, intestinal obstruction, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, blood bilirubin increased, esophageal metastasis cancer, hematuria, spinal operation, syncope and tumor pain (each with one patient). No patients withdrew from the study due to toxicity. Six patients required dose reductions due to neutropenia; nonetheless dose reductions were not required in connection with any other adverse events. Seven patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (i.e., growth factor support). Notably, no patients had grade ≥3 diarrhea as reported with other CDK inhibitors. 
 Study VNC-152-101: VIP152 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
 The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of VIP152 were evaluated in Study VNC-152-101. After a 30-minute IV infusion of VIP152, maximum concentrations were typically observed near the end of 
 
12 

  infusion. VIP152 exposures were approximately dose proportional, though an overlap in concentrations occurred between the 22.5- and 30-mg doses, likely due to patient variability (Panel A below). At 30 mg, which was declared as the MTD, day 1 AUC was 2780 µg·h/L, which is in the lower range of the predicted minimum therapeutic exposure based on MOLM-13 xenograft studies in rats (Panel C). VIP152 pharmacokinetics was comparable after single dose (C1D1) and multiple doses (C1D15), with no evidence of significant accumulation or alteration in general pharmacokinetic properties (Panel B). 
 For all doses, down regulation of MYC (Panel D), MCL-1, and PCNA mRNA levels compared with baseline were detected in peripheral blood cells. Down regulation was dose- and time-dependent with maximal pathway inhibition achieved at the two highest dose levels (22.5 and 30 mg).

  Study 17496: Efficacy (Dose Escalation Portion) 
 Of 30 patients with solid tumors treated in the dose escalation, disease control (stable disease) was observed in 7 patients (23%), 5 of whom received either 22.5 or 30 mg. Change in aggregate tumor size for evaluable patients is shown in below. Durable disease control was observed in individual patients with pancreatic cancer and salivary gland cancer (9.5 and 16.8 months of treatment, respectively). Of 7 patients with double-hit DLBCL treated with VIP152 30 mg once weekly, 2 patients had complete metabolic remissions (CMR); both achieved CMR after 10 cycles. When treatment ended due to the COVID pandemic (i.e., patients had been in long remission and did not want to risk COVID infection at the hospital), both were still in CMR. One had been receiving treatment for 3.7 years and the other for 2.3 years.

  Our Bioconjugation Platform 
 We have obtained from Bayer an exclusive license for a proprietary and innovative bioconjugation platform that we believe will leverage years of Bayer discovery know-how into innovative treatment modalities. The licensed platform includes a next generation ADC platform comprised of two preclinical-stage assets for hematology-oncology (IL3RA (also known as CD123) ADC and CXCR5 ADC) and an SMDC for solid tumors. 
Our Proprietary Bioconjugate Platforms—Shaping the Future 
 


Innovative SMDC platform 
 To improve the tumor selectivity of cytotoxic agents, our small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) use two methods of targeted delivery: binding to αvß3 and drug release mediated by enzymatic cleavage. VIP236, our lead candidate, consists of an αvß3 integrin binder and a linker that is cleavable by neutrophil elastase. The payload is an optimized camptothecin derivative designed for extracellular release. The payload displays high cellular permeability, and in contrast to SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, it is not a substrate of efflux transporters. The conjugate is highly efficacious in vivo effecting tumor regressions in SW480 (colon cancer), MX1 (breast cancer) and NCI-H69 (lung cancer) xenograft models with T/C ratios of 0.1, 0.03 and 0.06 (p<0.05 each, compared to vehicle control), respectively, and it shows very good tolerability. Initial pharmacokinetic studies in tumor bearing mice demonstrate a more than 10-fold improved tumor/plasma ratio of free toxophore when administered as a conjugate as compared with direct administration of unconjugated toxophore (see figure below).

  VIP236: SMDC with Tumor Stroma Activated Conjugate 
 


Abbreviations: NCE = new chemical entity; RC = renal cancer; SCLC = small cell lung cancer 
 Next-generation ADC technology 
 ADCs are a validated therapeutic approach in oncology used to selectively deliver a highly potent payload directly to tumors thereby minimizing toxicity to surrounding healthy tissue. Upon binding to the tumor cell antigen, the ADC is internalized by the tumor cell and the payload is released intracellularly, killing the cell in a targeted manner. To date, 12 ADCs have been approved by the FDA, with eight approvals in 2019-2020. 
 Despite the promise of ADCs, the challenge of optimizing the balance between efficacy and tolerability (i.e., therapeutic index or therapeutic window) has limited their broad potential as treatments for cancer. Our proprietary and innovative bioconjugation platform was engineered to specifically address toxicity issues plaguing current ADCs. The payload classes currently used are confined to microtubule binders (e.g., auristatin, dolastatin, maytansinoid and tubulysine), DNA interacting agents (e.g., calicheamicin, duocarmycin, PBD and IGN) and topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., SN38, camptothecin derivatives). Many of these permeable payloads and/or highly potent DNA-interacting payloads have safety issues, particularly with respect to premature release, and therefore result in an insufficient therapeutic index.

  Our next-generation ADC platform was engineered to deliver on the promise of ADCs as follows: 
 Our Next Generation ADC Technology Solutions 
 


Abbreviations: ADC = antibody-drug conjugate; Asn = asparagine (amino acid); DAR = drug-antibody ratio; KSPi = kinesin spindle protein inhibitor; MoA = mechanism of action; PK = pharmacokinetics 
 We are the first company to use a KSPi as a payload. Kinesin spindle protein is a motor protein responsible for an essential event in mitosis, the segregation of duplicated centrosomes during spindle formation in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and is, therefore, required for productive cell divisions. High expression of kinesin spindle protein in hematologic indications such as AML blasts, DLBCL and in solid cancers such as breast, bladder and pancreatic cancer has been linked to poorer prognosis, and thus, kinesin spindle protein presents an attractive target for cancer treatment. Kinesin spindle protein is active in all proliferating cells; therefore, KSPis, representing various structural classes, have resulted in neutropenia, mucositis and stomatitis in clinical trials. To date, these limitations have prevented approval of small molecule KSPis as cancer therapies, when administered systemically. However, tumor targeting with an impermeable KSPi that is released intracellularly overcomes the narrow therapeutic index of systemically administered agents by ensuring kinesin spindle protein is only inhibited in cancer cells and not in healthy tissue. We have two KSPi-ADCs, VIP943 and VIP924, in preclinical development for the treatment of hematologic malignancies: 

• | VIP943 is an anti-IL3RA-KSPi ADC
--+---------------------------------


• | VIP924 is an anti-CXCR5-KSPi ADC
--+---------------------------------



17 

  VIP943 and VIP924 have shown preclinical proof-of-concept in vivo in human leukemia and lymphoma tumor models in mice as shown below:

  Targeting IL3RA 
 IL3RA is the α-subunit of the IL-3 receptor. IL-3 is a protein, mainly produced by activated T cells, which regulates the function and production of immune cells by binding to the IL-3 receptor. IL3RA is expressed at high levels in AML, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms and myelodysplastic syndromes. Importantly, IL3RA overexpression on AML blasts has been associated with an increased number of leukemic blast cells at diagnosis and with a negative prognosis. 
 Several studies have indicated that IL-3 and its receptor play important roles in the progression of AML, and indeed, experiments with a monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of IL-3 to IL3RA have shown increased survival in AML mouse models. Characterization of hematologic malignancies has demonstrated increased IL3RA expression in AML blasts as compared with normal cells. Furthermore, these IL3RA-overexpressing cells have been shown to be able to initiate and maintain the leukemic process in immuno-deficient mice and thus act as leukemic stem cells. Consequently, IL3RA has been shown to be a useful biomarker for the detection of minimal residual disease, thereby predicting relapse in patients with AML. Taken together, these results suggest that IL3RA is a viable target for an ADC approach for the treatment of AML and other IL3RA-positive hematologic malignancies (e.g., MDS, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm). 
 VIP943 is well tolerated in preclinical models—Differentiation of KSPi-ADC Platform 
 The safety, including possible changes in the hematologic cell populations, of VIP943 was evaluated in the cynomolgus monkey in two range-finding studies with single or repeated dosing. VIP943 was well-tolerated without adverse events, such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or signs of liver toxicity, typically observed with ADCs containing other payload classes. In addition, mucositis, a dose-limiting toxicity for small molecule KSPis in clinical studies, was not observed. 
 These preclinical findings underscore the differentiation of the KSPi-ADC platform compared with currently approved ADCs for hematologic malignancies, as the observed clinical toxicities were predicted in the preclinical models as outlined below:

• | A nonpermeable and potent warhead (i.e., hydrophilic KSPi) to accumulate in tumor cells and prevent the killing of healthy cells (i.e., warhead accumulates in targeted cancer cells but cannot get into healthy cells); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A novel linker preferentially cleaved in tumor tissue vs normal cells (i.e., linker only cleaved by legumain, an enzyme over expressed in tumor tissue).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preclinical results for the KSPi-ADCs show efficacy without associated toxicity observed with the ADCs approved to date (e.g., monkey studies with the VIP943 showed no neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or liver toxicity).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IND enabling studies for the KSPi-ADCs are in planning.
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing 
 Because we are a clinical-stage company, we do not currently have our own marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. To commercialize VIP152 or any future product candidate, if approved for commercial sale and marketing, we would have to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations or partners to maximize the commercial opportunities for VIP152 or any future product candidates inside and outside the United States. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of VIP152, and there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the cGMP requirements of the FDA that might be capable of manufacturing for us. We currently intend to rely on contract manufacturing organizations, for both drug substance and drug product. In addition, we intend to recruit highly qualified personnel with experience to manage the contract manufacturing organizations producing our product candidates and other product candidates that we may develop in the future. Similarly, we do not own or operate a laboratory with expertise in diagnostic assessment of cancer subpopulations and will contract with specific commercial diagnostic labs on trials performed to assure a companion diagnostic(s) is available to accompany our therapeutic product. We will recruit highly qualified personnel with experience to manage these commercial diagnostic companies for our product candidates or those that we may develop in the future. 
 Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on contract manufacturing organizations to first develop cell lines and manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP requirements and then produce material for preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our agreements with contract manufacturing organizations may obligate them to develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product processes, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for preclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance or produce cGMP-compliant drug product. We will conduct audits of contract manufacturing organizations prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. A similar approach is applied to commercial diagnostic companies that we would partner with for companion diagnostics.

  Competition 
 The biotechnology industry, especially the oncology subspace, is characterized by fast-paced technological evolution, substantial competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. Competitors may come from multiple sources, including specialty, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, public and private research organizations, academic research institutions, and governmental agencies among others. Product candidates that we may develop and potentially get approved will face competitive pressures from incumbent therapies as well as new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many global pharmaceutical companies, as well as medium and small biotechnology companies, are pursuing new cancer treatments whether small molecules, biologics, ADCs, and cell or gene therapies. Any of these treatments could prove to be superior clinically to our products or product candidates and render them obsolete or non-competitive.
PTEFb Platforms 
 Our PTEFb inhibitors work by targeting the CDK9 of the PTEFb heteroduplex made up of CDK9 and Cyclin-T. To our knowledge, there are at least six other CDK9 programs in development demonstrating clinical efficacy and several are more advanced than our programs. The companies with clinical-stage programs include Merck & Co., Inc., Astra-Zeneca PLC, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals Inc., Kronos Bio, Inc., Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., Tolero Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and MEI Pharma, Inc. These companies and their current or future partners may develop CDK9 inhibitor programs with attributes to compete in the same indications as our current and future PTEFb product candidates. 
 In addition, there are many other companies who are pursuing targets around the PTEFb heteroduplex complex to affect similar transcriptional or disease processes as CDK9 inhibition may affect. Companies that are pursuing the inhibition of CDK7, CDK2, MYC, BRD4, PRMT and related transcriptional regulators may compete in the same indications as our PTEFb product candidates. These companies and their current or future partners may develop competing inhibitor programs with attributes to compete in the same indications as our current and future PTEFb product candidates. 
 Bioconjugation Platforms 
 We believe our bioconjugation platform components are well differentiated and provide us the flexibility of creating ADCs, SMDCs or other variants thereof to address specific needs to address individual diseases. Although our KSPi and the new ADC programs we have underway are proprietary and, in our view highly differentiated, many companies continue to invest in innovation in the ADC field including new payload classes, new conjugation approaches, and new targeting moieties. Any of these initiatives could lead to a platform that has superior properties to ours. We are aware of multiple companies with ADC technologies that may be competitive to our ADC platforms, including Astellas Pharma Inc., Astra-Zeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, ImmunoGen, Inc., Immunomedics, Inc., Mersana Therapeutics Inc., CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., Pyxis (which acquired Pfizer, Inc.’s ADC technology) and Seagen, Inc. These companies or their partners, including Johnson & Johnson Inc, Roche, AbbVie Inc., Genentech, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis International AG, Sanofi S.A., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited and AstraZeneca plc, may develop ADCs, SMDCs or related bioconjugation products based on the unique capabilities of each technology to compete in the same indications as our current and future bioconjugation product candidates. 
 We expect to compete on efficacy, safety and tolerability, and if our products are not demonstrably superior in these respects compared with other approved therapies, we may not be able to compete effectively, rendering our technologies, or our drug candidates, obsolete or non-competitive.
Many of our potential competitors, either alone or in partnership with other players, may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resource capabilities than our company. This in turn might allow them to 
 
21 

  become more successful than us in achieving treatment approvals and market acceptance, reducing the competitiveness of our treatments and accelerating their obsolescence. A continued trend showing strong mergers and acquisitions activity in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space may result in an increased concentration of resources among a smaller number of competitors. Earlier stage companies may also become relevant competitors, especially through collaborations with established companies. The areas of competition also extend to scientific and managerial talent recruitment and retention, clinical trial site and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in the attainment of technologies that might be complementary or necessary for our clinical programs. 
 It is possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment options for any of our indications by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete, or materially reduce the demand for our product candidates before recovering our development and commercialization expenses. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates faster than us, potentially resulting in a stronger market position for their products before we can get to market. 
 Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of small molecule drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of or current product candidates or any future product candidate. 
 FDA Drug Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDCA, except the section of such Act that governs the approval of NDAs. Biological products, such as our ADC product candidates, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, via a BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 The process required by the FDA before drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an Institutional Review Board or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



22 

  
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable FDA regulations, good clinical practice requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed drug product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA/BLA to file the application for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with good clinical practice requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA/BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is effectively a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. At any point, if the FDA has questions or concerns regarding an ongoing clinical trial, they may impose a clinical hold, for example, until such time as adjustments can be made to trial conduct which resolve the concerns. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practices, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. For new indications, a separate new IND may be required. Furthermore, an independent Institutional Review Board for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the Institutional Review Board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides recommendations for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend discontinuation of the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and 
 
23 

  clinical study results to public registries. For purposes of NDA/BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
 

• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with active malignancy for whom other therapy is not available.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA/BLA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an Institutional Review Board can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the Institutional Review Board’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may, at designated check points, recommend whether a trial should move forward based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA/BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Additional meetings and correspondence with the FDA can also occur to develop strategies for dose finding and dose optimization that leverages nonclinical and clinical data in dose selection, including randomized evaluations of a range of doses in trials. An emphasis of such strategies will be placed on performing these studies as early as possible in the development program and as efficiently as possible to bring promising new therapies to patients. 
 The FDA has begun implementing several initiatives to rapidly transition oncology drug development to reflect past success in transforming treatment options for many oncology indications. The shift from chemotherapy to molecular targeted therapies means many patients remain on therapy for extended periods of 
 
24 

  time. One such initiative, the FDA’s Project Optimus, is intended to transform the dose-finding and dose optimization paradigm across oncology to emphasize selection of a dose or doses that maximizes not only the efficacy of a drug but the safety and tolerability as well. The goals of this initiative include: 
 

• | communicating expectations for dose-finding and dose optimization, through guidance, workshops and other public meetings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing opportunities for and encouraging drug developers to meet with FDA Oncology Review Divisions early in their development programs, well before conducting trials intended for registration, to discuss dose-finding and dose optimization; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing strategies for dose finding and dose optimization that leverage nonclinical and clinical data in dose selection, including randomized evaluations of a range of doses in trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Project Optimus will require that new strategies be implemented in ongoing programs that leverage nonclinical and clinical data in dose selection, including the conduct of previously unplanned randomized evaluations of a range of doses in trials, and require that these studies take place as early as possible in the development program. We are reviewing and amending our ongoing studies, as needed, to address these new requirements, which could result in increased delays and costs. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before NDA/BLA approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 U.S. Submission, Review and Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA/BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA/BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of an NDA/BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 Once an NDA/BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing (a 60-day process), or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA/BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the 
 
25 

  facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. 
 Before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA/BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA/BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA/BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA/BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA/BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs. 
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs/BLAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. For molecularly targeted oncology drugs, the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act (2017) requires all diseases in which the molecular target is relevant be considered and agreement reached with the FDA on which pediatric indications are to be fully assessed. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the selected indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, 
 
26 

  including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 Any marketing application for a drug product submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval. 
 Priority review designation may be granted for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical needs by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA/BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA/BLA. The review clock does not begin until the final section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. 
 In addition, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 
27 

  Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. 
 Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA/BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA/BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application fee. 
 A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA/BLA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirements and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new 
 safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition 
 
28 

  of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, consent decrees or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
 Marketing Exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an ANDA or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. 
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of 
 
29 

  exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars. 
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by 
 
30 

  authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which our conducts its business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
 The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. 
 Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the anti-kickback statute can result in significant civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory civil penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the anti-kickback statute, the Affordable 
 
31 

  Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Similarly, with respect to foreign operations, we are subject to national privacy regulations such as the national implementations of the General Data Protection Regulation, which impose substantive compliance obligations for data collected in Europe. Furthermore, after the July 16, 2020 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Schrems II case, the legal framework for clinical trial related data export from Europe and the U.K. to the United States remains subject to the interpretation of each national Data Protection Authority, pending an E.U.-wide finding of adequacy of U.S. privacy protections. 
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sells any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada or the E.U., we may be subject to additional regulation. 
 We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain biopharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid 
 
32 

  Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. 
 In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program. 
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to operate its business and results of operations. 
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. 
 
33 

  Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, which decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is: 
 

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


• | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


• | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------


We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. 
 Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that it successfully develops. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U., governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to establish their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on 
 
34 

  healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act and Presidential executive orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of its requirements, and there could be additional challenges, amendments, executive orders and directives and legislation relating to the Affordable Care Act in the future. For example, although Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have passed. In 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the Affordable Care Act that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2029 absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products, lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs, increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, drug price control measures that could be enacted in future legislation include, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including 
 
35 

  price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices. 
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. 
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval. 
 The premarket approval process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. Premarket approval applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, premarket approvals for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a premarket approval application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the premarket approval review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 Premarket approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a premarket approval submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate, and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the premarket approval application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the premarket approval application. If the FDA’s evaluation of the premarket approval application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the premarket approval application or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the premarket approval application approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case approval of the premarket approval application may be 
 
36 

  delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the premarket approval application. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a premarket approval for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The premarket approval can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, approval of the premarket approval application may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. 
 We believe that it is in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on its business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect its future operations. 
 Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
 Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to 
 
37 

  operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 We have a license to patents and other intellectual property relating to VIP152, VIP217, VIP943, VIP924, VIP236, and our other current product candidates from Bayer on an exclusive, worldwide basis under the Bayer License Agreement. The portfolio as of December 31, 2021 includes 24 issued U.S. patents, 14 pending U.S. patent applications, 274 issued patents in various jurisdictions outside of the United States and approximately 134 pending patent applications in various jurisdictions outside of the United States. The Bayer License Agreement is described more fully below. 
 Our patent portfolio covering VIP152 consists of issued patents in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, India and Mexico, along with issued patents and pending applications in other markets. The issued U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of VIP152 is expected to expire in November 2033, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. With respect to VIP943 and VIP924, we have pending applications in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, India, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, along with an issued patent and pending applications in other markets covering the composition of matter of VIP943 and VIP924. Any patent that may issue from our pending patent applications related to VIP943 and VIP924 are expected to expire in December 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. With respect to VIP236, we have pending applications in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, India, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and other markets covering the composition of matter of VIP236. Any patent that may issue from our pending patent applications related to VIP236 is expected to expire in October 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, our patent portfolio covering VIP217 consists of issued patents in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, India and Mexico, along with issued patents and pending applications in other markets. The issued U.S. patent covering the composition of matter of VIP217 is expected to expire in April 2035, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. 
 We also rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Bayer License Agreement 
 On October 7, 2020, we entered into the Bayer License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, worldwide license under certain Bayer patents and know-how to develop, use, manufacture, commercialize, sublicense and distribute, for all uses in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders in humans or animals, (i) a clinical-stage small molecule drug platform, including VIP152 (formerly known as BAY 1251152), a PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor compound, and (ii) a preclinical stage bioconjugation platform, including VIP924 (formerly BAY-924), and VIP943 (formerly known as BAY-943), next-generation ADC compounds, and VIP236, a SMDC compound. These platforms currently

  comprise our entire product candidate pipeline. The Bayer License Agreement became effective upon the closing of the Business Combination. 
 Under the Bayer License Agreement, we paid Bayer an upfront license fee of $5.0 million upon the closing of the Business Combination. In addition, we are obligated to make significant future payments to Bayer upon the achievement of certain development and commercial sales milestones involving license products as well as ongoing royalties on net commercial sales. The size and timing of these milestone payments vary greatly depending on factors such as the particular licensed product, whether it involves a PTEFb licensed product or an ADC licensed product (and which ADC program – IL3RA, CXCR5, SMDC or additional programs), the number of distinct disease indications, the number of different countries with respect to which the milestone is achieved and the level of net commercial sales, and it is therefore difficult to estimate the total payments that may become payable to Bayer and when those payments would be due. If we achieve all of the milestones for each of the countries and disease indications, we would be obligated to pay development and commercial sales milestone payments that range from $110.0 million to up to $318.0 million per licensed product, and upon successful commercialization of at least five licensed products, we could be required to pay aggregate milestone payments in excess of $1.0 billion. If we partner with a third party and receive development milestone payments from such third party that exceed the development milestone payments, we are required to pay Bayer for the same milestones, we are required to pay Bayer a small portion of that excess. 
 Under the Bayer License Agreement, we are also obligated to pay Bayer tiered royalties on worldwide net commercial sales of license products at royalty rates ranging from single digit to low double digit percentages based on escalating levels of net commercial sales in a calendar year, subject to standard offsets and reductions. These royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the latest of (i) the date on which the last valid claim of any licensed patents expire, and (ii) 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product, in each case, with respect to a given licensed product in a given country. 
 Under the Bayer License Agreement, we have sole control of, and are responsible for, at our expense, the development, manufacture and commercialization of licensed products. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with our business judgment and for a similarly situated company, to develop and commercialize at least one PTEFb licensed product and two ADC licensed products in certain major markets. We have the sole right, but not the obligation, to control the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the licensed patents, and Bayer has backup rights to prosecution, defense and enforcement with respect to any licensed patents for which we elect not to exercise such rights. 
 The Bayer License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the expiration of the last royalty term with respect to a given licensed product in a given country, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ written notice. Either party may terminate the agreement, either in its entirety or on a licensed technology-by-licensed technology or licensed product-by-licensed product basis depending on the nature of the breach, if the other party materially breaches its material obligations under the agreement and fails to cure such material breach within 180 days of written notice of such material breach, with termination tolled during any period during which a good faith dispute resolution process is being pursued with respect to material breaches other than non-payment. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, is subject to an involuntary bankruptcy petition or for certain other insolvency events. Bayer may terminate the agreement if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents. 
 Human Capital/Employees 
 We are an early stage start-up company with limited operating history. We exclusively licensed our current pipeline from Bayer under the Bayer License Agreement and intend to bring one or more product candidates through clinical trials and marketing authorization. We have assembled a management team of biopharmaceutical 
 
39 

  experts with extensive experience in building and operating organizations that develop and deliver innovative medicines to patients with cancer. Our management team has broad expertise and successful track records in clinical development and approval of cancer therapies. 
 We are led by Drs. Ahmed M. Hamdy and Raquel E. Izumi, two co-founders and biotechnology entrepreneurs who previously leveraged the discovery know-how of an established pharmaceutical company into a break-through blood cancer treatment. Drs. Hamdy and Izumi were instrumental in the clinical development of IMBRUVICA® and CALQUENCE® for the treatment of blood cancers. Drs. Hamdy and Izumi were principal co-founders of Acerta Pharma, the company that developed CALQUENCE® from an early-stage preclinical molecule through clinical trials and full marketing approval. Acerta Pharma was formed to license the preclinical stage molecule and technology that would become CALQUENCE®. Three years after inception, Acerta Pharma was acquired by AstraZeneca plc for $7.0 billion. 
 Drs. Hamdy and Izumi, and the rest of our management team, are supported by an external team of experienced cancer drug developers including John C. Byrd, M.D., the Chair of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Cincinnati and Chief Medical Officer of BEAT AML, and Brian J. Druker, M.D., Director at Oregon Health & Science University’s Knight Cancer Institute School of Medicine. Dr. Byrd serves as chair of our Scientific Advisory Committee, and Dr. Druker serves on our board of directors. 
 As our core ethos, we believe that our people are our company’s greatest asset, and that by creating an open, aware, accepting, and diverse workplace, we will, by extension, create a responsive, innovative, and successful company. This ethos guides the focus of our human capital objectives and the emphasis we place on employee retention and team culture and diversity. As of December 31, 2021, we had 56 full-time employees, including 22 employees who hold either M.D. or Ph.D. degrees (39%). Of these 56 employees, 41 were engaged in research and development (73%), and 15 were engaged in general and administrative functions (27%). None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 We believe that we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to our employees based on up-to-date peer company benchmarks, including employee and dependent healthcare insurance, flexible paid time off and leave policies, meaningful equity grants, and retirement planning. For ongoing learning and development, we sponsor culture workshops, training and education resources and programs, coaching, and other resources to help employees, at all levels, feel a sense of belonging and support to achieve their full potential. 
 We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In 2021, we introduced employee surveys that show a strong overall happiness score, with highest rankings for culture, management, and diversity. We believe our employees and our company benefit from and excel in a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment. Our employees come from numerous countries, ethnicities, and backgrounds and bring diversity to our workplace. As of December 31, 2021, 46% of our global workforce, 45% of our leadership (at Senior Director level and above), and 33% of our board of directors identified as female. We believe the variety of the experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives that our employees bring to their work every day, and our focus on diversity and inclusion, make our Company stronger and more successful and will enable us to further strengthen our collaborative culture, continue to enhance employee engagement and satisfaction, and drive innovation and improved performance. As we look forward in 2022, we plan to implement additional ways to measure, track, and report on employee diversity, inclusion, and satisfaction initiatives. 
 Facilities 
 Our principal executive offices are located in Palo Alto, California, and our lease agreement for such space expires in December 2025. Vincerx Pharma GmbH, our wholly owned German subsidiary, leases space in Monheim am Rhein, Germany. We do not own any real property. We believe that our office space is adequate to meet our current needs and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet future needs.
