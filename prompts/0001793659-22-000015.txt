ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context requires otherwise, each of the terms the “Company,” “Rush Street Interactive,” “RSI,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms used herein refer collectively to Rush Street Interactive, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, following the Business Combination, other than certain historical information which refers to the business of Rush Street Interactive, LP prior to the consummation of the Business Combination.
Overview
We are a leading online gaming and entertainment company that focuses primarily on online casino and online sports betting in the U.S. and Latin American markets. Our mission is to provide our customers with the most user-friendly online casino and online sports betting experience in the industry. In furtherance of this mission, we strive to create an online community for our customers where we are transparent and honest, treat our customers fairly, show them that we value their time and loyalty, and listen to feedback. We also endeavor to implement industry leading responsible gaming practices and provide our customers with a cutting-edge online gaming platform and exciting, personalized offerings that will enhance their user experience.
We provide our customers an array of leading gaming offerings such as real-money online casino, online sports betting, and retail sports betting, as well as social gaming, which involves free-to-play games that use virtual credits that users can earn or purchase. We launched our first social gaming website in 2015 and began accepting real-money bets in the United States in 2016. Currently, we offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in thirteen U.S. states as outlined in the table below.

In 2018, we also became the first U.S.-based online gaming operator to launch in Colombia, which was an early adopting Latin American country to legalize and regulate online casino and sports betting nationally. In addition, we launched our social gaming offering in Canada during October 2021 and anticipate launching real-money online casino and sports betting there in 2022. We also expect to launch online casino and sports betting in Mexico in the second quarter of 2022.
Our real-money online casino and online sports betting offerings are currently provided under our BetRivers.com and PlaySugarHouse.com brands in the United States and under our RushBet.co brand in Colombia. In certain jurisdictions, we operate retail sports betting, which is offered under our BetRivers.com or PlaySugarHouse.com brands. In other jurisdictions, we operate and/or support retail sports betting for our bricks-and-mortar partners primarily under their respective brands. Many of our social gaming offerings are marketed under our partners’ brands, although we also offer social gaming under our own brands as well. Our decision about what brand or brands to use is market- and partner-
specific, and is based on brand awareness, market research, marketing efficiency and applicable gaming rules and regulations.
Corporate History, Background and Business Combination
We were initially a blank check company called dMY Technology Group, Inc. (“dMY”), incorporated as a corporation in Delaware on September 27, 2019, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 29, 2020, dMY consummated the transactions contemplated by the business combination agreement dated as of July 27, 2020, as amended and amended and restated (the “Business Combination Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Business Combination”), and in connection therewith: (i) dMY acquired Rush Street Interactive, LP (“RSILP”) in an umbrella partnership–C corporation (“Up-C”) structure, in which substantially all the assets of the Company are held by RSILP, and the Company’s only assets are its equity interests in RSILP; (ii) the holders of equity interests of RSILP (the “Sellers”) retained certain of their Class A common units of RSILP (the “RSILP Units”) and received an equal number of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class V Voting Stock”); (iii) the Company issued and sold to subscribers in a private placement an aggregate of 16,043,002 shares of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class A Common Stock” and such private placement, the “PIPE”); and (iv) dMY changed its name to “Rush Street Interactive, Inc.”
The Sellers have the right to exchange the RSILP Units retained by the Sellers (the “Retained RSILP Units”) for either one share of Class A Common Stock or, upon certain conditions, the cash equivalent of the market value of one share of Class A Common Stock. For each Retained RSILP Unit so exchanged, the Company will cancel one share of the Class V Voting Stock.
A description of the material terms of the Business Combination and ancillary agreements entered into in connection therewith is set forth in the Registration Statement on Form S-1, Registration No. 333-252810, filed with the SEC on February 5, 2021, and as amended from time to time, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Our Business and Operating Models
We enter new markets by leveraging our proprietary online gaming platform and our ability to provide either a full-suite service model or a customized solution to fit a specific situation. Our business model is designed to be nimble, innovative and customer-centric. By leveraging our dynamic proprietary online gaming platform, we aspire to be “first to market” where real-money online gaming has been newly legalized and where our management determines that it is desirable to enter such market.
Our principal offerings are our real-money online casino and online sports betting products. These products can be launched under one of our existing brands or customized to be incorporated into a local or third-party brand. We also provide a variety of retail sports betting solutions to service land-based casino and other partners and leverage our social gaming offerings to increase customer engagement and build online databases in key markets both before and after legalization and regulation.
We currently generate revenue through two operating models: (i) business-to-consumer (“B2C”) and (ii) business-to-business (“B2B”). Through our B2C operations, we offer online casino, online sports betting and social gaming directly to the end customer through our websites or apps. B2C is our primary operating model, contributing more than 99% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and we expect that it will continue to be our primary operating model into the future. We believe this is a flexible operating model that permits us to customize our operating structure based on applicable gaming regulations, market demands and, as applicable, our land-based partner’s operations. Through our B2B operations, we offer retail sports betting services to land-based businesses, such as bricks-and-mortar casinos, in exchange for a monthly commission.
Often in advance of markets legalizing online gaming, we build relationships with local bricks-and-mortar casino operators and other potential land-based partners who are looking for online gaming and sports betting partners. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the applicable gaming regulations require online gaming operators that offer real-money offerings to operate under the gaming license of, or partner with, a land-based operator such as a bricks-and-mortar casino or other type of local partner such as a professional sports team. Consequently, we leverage our relationships with bricks-and-mortar casinos and vendors in the gaming industry to find high-quality and reliable partners for online gaming collaboration. Upon securing a partner for access to a specific market (if required or desirable) and before we launch operations in that market, 
we customize our online gaming platform to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction. Then, upon entering a new market, we employ a number of marketing strategies to obtain new customers as well as leverage our partner’s database when applicable. We continuously refine our offerings and marketing strategies based on data collected from each market.
To attract, engage, retain and/or reactivate customers, we offer a loyalty program that rewards customers in exciting, fair and transparent ways. We recognize and reward customer loyalty by, among other things, ensuring that there are exciting benefits at each of the customer loyalty levels we currently offer. Each of our online gaming customers is a member of our customer loyalty program. We grant bonus store points to our customers based upon completed bets. Once earned, such points can be redeemed to unlock bonus incentives and to play our proprietary bonus games, providing further opportunities to win prizes and bonus dollars. Customers also have the option to “bank” awarded bonuses in our proprietary “bonus bank”, which they can draw from whenever they wish under our industry-leading 1x wager playthrough requirement, meaning that they need only place one bet with the bonus dollars before cashing out any winnings. Based on research and customer feedback, we attempt to address customer concerns about the general lack of transparency in the industry around awarding, redeeming and tracking bonuses by enabling customers to easily track their loyalty and bonus progressions and giving customers control over when and how to redeem their rewards.
We strive to be the first online operator to launch in most new markets (or launch our online operations on the first day possible), and we have been successful in doing such in many markets. However, we have also achieved success when we were not the first to enter a market. For example, we entered the New Jersey online casino market approximately three years after that market opened and there were already numerous competitors in the market at that time. Less than three years after beginning operations in New Jersey, we were the #4 online casino brand in New Jersey based on revenue, out of 19 total operators in the market at that time, according to the Eilers & Krejcik Gaming (“EKG”) United States Online Casino Tracker for April 2019.
We believe our success in New Jersey is also noteworthy because we compete with many other companies that have affiliated land-based casinos there. Neither us nor RSG, an affiliated land-based casino operator, operate a bricks-and-mortar casino in New Jersey. Thus, we believe our performance in New Jersey demonstrates that we can be successful in entering competitive markets even without the benefit of an affiliated bricks-and-mortar casino presence.
Competitive Strengths
As we continue to expand in existing and new jurisdictions, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain and build upon our accomplishments by virtue of our competitive strengths:
Proprietary Online Gaming Platform. Owning a proprietary online gaming platform has allowed us to innovate quickly and introduce numerous unique, user-friendly features. We believe these features have helped increase conversion rates from registrations to first-time depositors, improve customer engagement and retention and increase customer spending. Further, we can update our online gaming platform at a rate that we believe is among the fastest in the industry. As the U.S. online gaming industry develops, our online gaming platform should help us better cater to the evolving needs of our current and potential customers and partners. In the long run, we believe our online gaming platform will lead to reduced costs and improved revenue per customer relative to our peers, many of which license their online platforms from third parties.
Unique and Diversified Product Offering. We have prioritized the customization of our offerings, bonusing of our customers and optimization of our platform. For example, we have developed some of our own online casino games, which are higher margin for us than those licensed from third parties. We have also developed and incorporated numerous proprietary bonusing features that appeal to casino and sports betting customers alike. Our omni-channel platform provides a vast amount of functionality such as location-based decisioning, unified conditional bonusing, gamified award scenarios, customer dashboards (online and at retail), promotional games, real-time awards and promotion management, sophisticated reporting and responsible gaming features, among others.
Market Access and Speed to Market. We currently operate online casino and/or online sports betting in thirteen states (Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia) with an aggregate population of approximately 105 million people. In addition, we have currently secured potential market access to Ohio, Maryland, Missouri and if certain conditions are met, Texas, in each case subject to certain legislative and/or regulatory developments or approvals, which have an aggregate population of approximately 54 million people. We have a proven ability to quickly enter markets as they are regulated. For instance, in the last 24 months, we have been “first to market” or among the “first to market” where multiple operators were granted 
approval to launch at the same time, in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan and New York for online sports betting and in Illinois for retail sports betting.
Flexible Business Model. We believe we are well positioned to serve newly regulated jurisdictions regardless of the form of their regulations. Our flexible business model enables us to function as a B2C operator or a B2B supplier or joint venturer, depending on market conditions, applicable laws and regulations, and the needs of our partners. This flexibility should allow us to have a core advantage in securing market access and help us address the largest potential total addressable market (“TAM”).
Large TAM with International Opportunity. We believe our TAM is larger than most U.S.-only operators because of our international real-money online gaming and betting operations in Colombia as well as our flexible business model as described directly above. We believe this experience will help us enter other regulated Latin American markets and beyond such as Mexico, where we anticipate launching operations in the second quarter of 2022.
Broad Demographic Appeal of our Brands & Products. We also believe that our brands, offerings and marketing strategies have demonstrated an appeal to both female and male customers, as evidenced by an approximately 55-45 female/male split in our active U.S. online casino-only customers during calendar year 2021. We believe that while many sports-centric brands appeal more to male customers, our brands and offerings (especially our slot machine game play experience) appeal strongly to female customers – an important demographic for high-value offerings such as online slot machine games.
Compelling Unit Economics. Based on our performance to date, including in New Jersey, one of the most highly competitive U.S. market in terms of the number of online gaming operators, we believe that we can achieve industry-leading lifetime value to customer acquisition cost ratios. Despite entering the New Jersey online casino market nearly three years after it launched, we generated revenue in excess of five times the advertising costs to acquire those same customers in those customers’ first three years after becoming active on our platform. As shown in the table below, we were able to recoup our acquisition costs on a net revenue basis within seven months of launching in New Jersey. We believe this rapid return on advertising spending is a result of our expertise in strategically targeting, acquiring, engaging and retaining the right customers.
Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost in New Jersey

Seasoned Executive Team. Our executive team has significant global gaming experience, including with online market leaders such as WMS Industries (now Scientific Games), Playtech and the Kindred Group. Our Chief Executive Officer Richard Schwartz, CIO Einar Roosileht and COO Mattias Stetz all had online gaming experience prior to joining RSI, which we believe has been instrumental in helping capture U.S. market share. Our Executive Chairman Neil Bluhm has a proven track record of developing world-class land-based casinos and has developed numerous successful real estate projects.
Social Gaming Platform. We offer social gaming on the same proprietary online gaming platform as our real-money offerings, which allows us to build user databases in jurisdictions where real-money gaming is not yet regulated or legal. Having both of these products on the same platform allows us to invest in markets before real-money gaming has launched. We believe our social gaming offering strengthens brand awareness and engagement from existing customers, helps to acquire new customers and drives increased visitation to our partners’ bricks-and-mortar properties.
Growth Strategies
As we continue to invest in our core competitive advantages and improve the customer experience, we believe we will remain well positioned to expand upon our existing leadership position in the online casino and online sports betting industries. We have established several key areas of strategic focus that will guide the way we consider our future growth:
Access new geographies. With our experience in regulated gaming jurisdictions in the United States and Latin America, we are prepared to enter new jurisdictions as online casino and sports betting are authorized. Whether we enter a new jurisdiction as an online operator marketing directly to end users or on behalf of our land-based partner (B2C), as a platform provider to a third-party (B2B), or any permutation of the foregoing, our goal is to be ready to enter jurisdictions that provide for legal online casino and sports betting where we believe conditions enable us to earn a strong return on our invested capital.
Leverage existing customer-level economics to increase marketing spending. Since January 2017, we have generated approximately 5.4 times the lifetime revenue per the acquisition cost to acquire those same customers in New Jersey. We 
may see opportunities to leverage those attractive economics to increase marketing spending in New Jersey and other jurisdictions on a strategic basis and where we project acquiring incremental customers will generate revenue that exceed our internal targets.
Continue to invest in our offerings and our platform. We have established a set of competencies that we believe position us at the forefront of the evolving online casino and online sports industry. We will continue iterating on our core user experiences while reinforcing the data-driven, marketing and technological infrastructure that allows us to continue to scale our offerings. We plan to continue to invest in our customers and our offerings as we remain driven to keep customers engaged while expanding the capabilities of our platform that will enable us to rapidly reach new jurisdictions and attract new customers.
Continue to invest in personnel. In furtherance of accessing new jurisdictions, we have been and plan to continue to grow our operational, technology and corporate services teams to broaden product development capabilities, innovation and efficiency, reduce reliance on third parties and scale digital user capabilities.
Acquisitions. On a targeted basis, we will seek out acquisition targets that enable us to accelerate our technology plans, obtain exclusive content, expand our customer reach or add efficiencies that potentially bring third-party costs in-house.
Human Capital Resources
We strongly believe that our people are a key reason for our success. As such, we focus heavily on our people, starting with the recruiting process to ensure we are hiring the right people who have a desirable skill set while enhancing our corporate culture. Once hired, we strive to empower our people and encourage creativity, collaboration and entrepreneurship. We provide, among other things, on-the-job training and access to professional and technical coaches to support the development, advancement and engagement of our employees. Our corporate culture focuses heavily on valuing employees and enabling them to grow, succeed and take on roles and projects that utilize their strengths. Recognizing our people’s accomplishments, both professionally and personally, is also crucial to our corporate culture. Furthermore, we believe that developing a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace for our people will enable our people to be more productive and ultimately will result in our long-term success. Our flexible paid time off programs permit our employees to pursue personal interests and goals away from their day-to-day job responsibilities.
We have built a team of talented industry professionals, primarily focused on technology and operations, who are supported by a highly experienced senior management team with significant experience in the online and land-based gaming industries. We believe our corporate culture combined with our growth and success has created very high rates of employee retention.
As of March 2, 2022, we had a global workforce of approximately 468 employees and contractors, with approximately 39% of our people working in technical roles. Approximately 49% of our people are based in the United States with the remaining 51% being based elsewhere in the world, including Canada, Colombia, Estonia and Mexico.
Our Products and Economic Model
Our Revenue-Generating Product Offerings
We currently offer real-money online casino, online sports betting and/or retail sports betting in thirteen U.S. states and Colombia. We also provide social gaming (where permitted, including Ontario, Canada), where users are given virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games.
Our revenue is predominantly generated from our U.S. operations with the remaining revenue being generated from our Colombian operations. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We generate revenue primarily through the following offerings:
Online Casino
Online casino offerings typically include the full suite of games available in bricks-and-mortar casinos, such as table games (i.e., blackjack and roulette) and slot machines. For these offerings, we function similarly to bricks-and-mortar casinos, generating revenue through hold, or gross winnings, as customers play against the house. Like bricks-and-mortar casinos, there is volatility with online casino, but as the number of bets placed increases, the revenue retained from bets 
placed becomes easier to predict. Our experience has been that online casino revenue is less volatile than sports betting revenue.
Our online casino offering consists of licensed content from leading suppliers, customized third-party games and a small number of proprietary games that we developed in-house. Third-party content is usually subject to standard revenue-sharing agreements specific to each supplier, where the supplier generally receives a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated from its casino games played on our platform. In exchange, we receive a limited license to offer the games on our platform to customers in jurisdictions where use is approved by the regulatory authorities. We pay much lower fees on revenue generated through our in-house developed casino games such as our multi-bet blackjack (with side bets: 21+3, Lucky Ladies, Lucky Lucky) and single-deck blackjack, which primarily relate to hosting/remote gaming server fees and certain intellectual property license fees.
Online casino revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in the progressive jackpot reserve.
Online Sports Betting
Online sports betting involves a user placing a bet on the outcome of a sporting event, or a series of sporting events, with the chance to win a pre-determined amount, often referred to as fixed odds. Online sports betting revenue is generated by setting odds such that there is a built-in theoretical margin in each sports bet offered to customers. While sporting event outcomes may result in revenue volatility, we believe that we can achieve a long-term betting win margin. In addition to traditional fixed-odds betting, we also offer other sports betting products including in-game betting and multi-sport and same-game parlay betting. We have also incorporated live streaming of certain sporting events into our online sports betting offering.
Integrated into our online sports betting platform is a third-party risk and trading platform currently provided by certain subsidiaries of Kambi Group plc.
Online sports revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in unsettled sports bets.
Retail Sports Betting
We provide retail sports services to land-based partners in exchange for a monthly commission that is calculated based on the land-based retail sportsbook revenue. Services generally include ongoing management and oversight of the retail sportsbook (i.e., within a bricks-and-mortar location), technical support for the partner’s customers, risk management, advertising and promotion, and support for third-party sports betting equipment.
In addition, certain relationships with business partners provide us the ability to operate the retail sportsbook at the land-based partner’s facility. In this scenario, revenue is generated based on total customer bets less amounts paid to customers for winning bets, less other incentives awarded to customers, plus or minus the change in unsettled retail sports bets.
Social Gaming
We provide social gaming (where permitted) where users are given virtual credits to enjoy free-to-play games. Users who exhaust their credits can either purchase additional virtual credits from the virtual cashier or wait until their virtual credits are replenished for free. Virtual credits have no independent monetary value and can only be used within our social gaming platform.
Our social gaming business has three main goals: building online databases in key markets ahead of and post-legalization and regulation; generating revenues; and increasing engagement and visitation to our bricks-and-mortar partner properties. Our social gaming products are a marketing tool that keeps the applicable brands present in the minds of our users and engages with users through another channel while providing the entertainment value that users seek. We also leverage our social gaming products to cross-sell to our real-money offerings in jurisdictions where real-money gaming is authorized.
We recognize deferred revenue when users purchase virtual credits and revenue when those credits are redeemed. We pay a percentage of the social gaming revenue derived from the sale and redemption of the virtual credits to content suppliers as well as to our land-based partners.
Costs and Expenses
Costs of Revenue. Costs of revenue consist primarily of (i) revenue share and market access fees, (ii) platform and content fees, (iii) gaming taxes, (iv) payment processing fees and chargebacks and (v) salaries, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel. These costs are variable in nature and should, in large part, correlate with the change in revenue. Revenue share and market access fees consist primarily of amounts paid to local land-based partners that hold the applicable gaming license, providing us the ability to offer our real-money online offerings in the respective jurisdictions. Our platform and content fees are primarily driven by costs associated with third-party casino content, sports betting trading services and certain elements of our platform technology, such as geolocation and know-your-customer. Gaming taxes primarily relate to state taxes and are determined on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We incur payment processing costs on customer deposits and occasionally chargebacks (i.e., when a payment processor contractually disallows customer deposits in the normal course of business).
Advertising and Promotions Costs. Advertising and promotion costs consist primarily of costs associated with marketing our offerings via different channels, promotional activities and the related costs incurred to acquire new customers. These costs also include salaries, benefits and share-based compensation for dedicated personnel and are expensed as incurred.
Our ability to effectively market is critical to our success. Using dynamic learnings and analytics, we leverage marketing to acquire, convert, retain and re-engage customers. We use earned media and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and unique game and site features, to attract and engage customers. Further, we continuously optimize our marketing spend using data collected from our operations. Our marketing spend is based on a return-on-investment model that considers a variety of factors, including the products and services offered in the jurisdiction, the performance of different marketing channels, predicted lifetime value, marginal costs and expenses and behavior of customers across various product offerings.
With respect to paid marketing, we use a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media platforms, sponsorships, affiliates and paid search, and other digital channels. We also use other forms of marketing and outreach, such as our social media channels, first-party websites, media interviews and other media spots and organic searches. These efforts are primarily concentrated within the specific jurisdictions where we operate or intend to operate. We believe there is significant benefit to having a flexible approach to advertising spending as we can quickly redirect our advertising spending based on dynamic testing of our advertising methods and channels.
General Administration and Other. General administration and other expenses consist primarily of administrative personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses and benefits, share-based compensation expense, professional fees related to legal, compliance, audit and consulting services, rent and insurance costs.
Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation on our property and equipment and amortization of market access licenses, gaming jurisdictional licenses, internally developed software, and finance lease right of use asset amortization over their useful lives. See Notes 2, 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Distribution
We distribute our online offerings through various channels, including websites (traditional and mobile), direct application downloads and global direct-to-consumer digital platforms such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play store. We distribute our retail offerings primarily through self-service betting terminals and standalone computer terminals.
We have developed proprietary technology, product offerings and partnerships to create a sustainable advantage in the online casino and sports betting industry. Strategic multi-year arrangements with land-based partners such as bricks-and-mortar casinos, Native American tribes or professional sports teams enable us to make our offerings available to customers in certain jurisdictions using a B2C operating model. Currently, we have numerous arrangements in place where legislation or regulations require us to enter the market through a relationship with a land-based partner or we have otherwise 
determined that entering into such an arrangement is desirable. We also have relationships with several land-based partners through a B2B operating model.
Our Development Team
Our development team is led by our Chief Information Officer, Einar Roosileht, and consists of a set of cross functional product development teams comprised of talented individuals with expertise in system architecture, client and server-side product engineering, database architecture, product, engineering and project management, website and native app design and development, security and technical support. Consistent with our overall corporate strategy, the team constantly aims to innovate and differentiate our online offerings.
Proprietary Online Gaming Platform
Our proprietary online gaming platform has been developed and is operated by a seasoned team with global online gaming experience operating across product categories, with particular expertise in the two largest online/mobile product categories: casino and sports betting. We believe our online gaming platform and technology stack give us the ability to provide a personalized, data-driven user journey. The ability to customize the playing experience for each user is a key feature of our online gaming platform. We achieve user personalization by analyzing user history and transactions, and offering customized promotions and real-time, betting-driven bonusing.
As demonstrated in the picture below, in addition to developing a robust online gaming platform, we have developed and are continuing to improve proprietary modules for our online casino and sports betting product verticals in order to offer a unique and differentiated experience to our customers. Such modules include both frontend and backend components and flexible management tools, which our operations teams use to customize experiences for different user segments. Content for both online casino games and sports betting offers primarily comes from integrated third parties. In addition to developing proprietary technology, as a vertically integrated technology company we operate our own products and platform, with our customer service and marketing operations teams leveraging powerful existing analytics solutions, which are a part of our online gaming platform.
We can develop and implement new features in real-time, which we believe enhances the customer experience and increases customer retention. By owning our own online gaming platform, we can more easily improve and customize the user experience and incorporate key aspects of our operational services into our offerings:
•Payments & Risk Management
•Regulatory Online Reporting & Accounting / Online Gaming Compliance
•Website Management / Games Management / Live Tech Ops / Security
•Online Affiliate Management & Tracking
•Retention / CRM / Business Intelligence & Analytics
•Customer Service
In addition, owning our online gaming platform enables us to prioritize speed to market for new offerings while providing an engaging and unique user experience. Since 2016, we have leveraged our platform to expand our real-money operations and launch in new markets. Additionally, we were the first company to launch (or among the first to launch if multiple operators launched on the same day) online or retail sports betting in several of the markets in which we operate, which we believe has allowed us to acquire customers at a lower cost than we could have if launching in a more mature market.
Our Industry and Opportunity
We currently operate within the online gaming and entertainment industry. The global gaming industry includes a wide array of products such as lotteries, bingo, slot machines, poker, casino games, sports betting, horse racing, e-sports and virtual sports, across land-based and online platforms. The industry has various operators and stakeholders across the private and public sectors, including traditional bricks-and-mortar casinos, state-run lottery operators, Native American tribes, legacy online gaming operators, non-traditional operators such as consumer goods or services brands that have entered or intend to enter the industry, racetracks/racinos/video lottery terminals, private equity or other investment funds, gaming content providers, gaming regulators, gaming technology companies and payment processors.
Recently, online gaming has seen outsized growth and increased penetration. Per the European Gaming & Betting Association (the “EGBA”), regulated online gaming grew in Europe, the most mature online gaming market in the world, at an annual rate of 17% from 2019 to 2020 and 19% from 2020 to 2021, despite cancellations and postponements of major European sports in 2020. The EGBA also projects a 7% growth rate through 2025 in European online gaming revenue.
We believe the following trends are potential drivers of growth in this industry:
•New U.S. and international jurisdictions authorizing and/or privatizing their online casino and online sports betting industries; and
•Increasing consumer adoption of digital and online activities, including casino and sports betting. While many other large U.S. industries (i.e., banks, retail stores, movies, etc.) digitalized over a decade ago, the U.S. gaming industry has just started to do so more recently.
In the past decade, there has been significant regulatory momentum with respect to online gaming across the globe. This momentum has been particularly relevant in developed nations whose citizens generally have disposable income to spend on entertainment and gaming. For example, the UK, Denmark, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Denmark, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland have legalized and regulated online casino and online sports betting. In addition, Mexico, and in recent years numerous U.S. states, Colombia and certain provinces in Argentina and Canada have legalized and/or regulated online gaming. All these countries are in the “high income” income group according to the World Bank. We expect this trend to continue into the future, most notably in the United States.
U.S. Gaming Industry
We see tremendous opportunity in the U.S. online gaming market. As U.S. jurisdictions become regulated and mature, online gaming penetration may approach that of other developed nations. For example, the UK Gambling Commission (“UKGC”) reported that approximately 40% of the UK’s gross gaming revenue during the period April 2019 to March 2020 (a period that was largely unaffected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) came from online gaming. To put that UK figure into context, Pennsylvania, which launched online casino and sports betting in H1 2019, generated a combined $1.71 billion in taxable revenue from land-based casino, online casino and online sports betting revenue in H2 2019 (a period largely unaffected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) according to data from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Of this amount, only approximately 4.5% came from online casino and online sports betting. During H2 2020, when the United States was experiencing many of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home orders, shutdowns of bricks-and-mortar businesses and cancellations or postponements of sporting events, Pennsylvania generated a combined $1.62 billion in taxable revenue from land-based casino, online casino and online 
sports betting according to Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Of this amount, 29.3% came from online casino and online sports betting. Although the United States has a much more significant land-based casino industry than the UK, we believe these statistics show the future opportunity for online gaming in the United States.
U.S. Online Casino
Currently, online casino is authorized in fewer states than sports betting. As of the date hereof, online casino is authorized only in seven states: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Nevada (although regulators have not authorized online casino outside of physical casinos in Nevada). We believe there is great potential for revenue growth as new markets open in the United States. For example, the mature land-based U.S. casino industry is sizable, with estimated combined revenues in 2019 (the most recent full year largely unaffected by the impacts of COVID-19) and 2020 for U.S. land-based commercial and tribal casinos of approximately $78.2 billion and $57.8 billion, respectively, based on data from the National Indian Gaming Commission in Washington D.C. and the American Gaming Association. 
In the latter half of 2013, New Jersey became the first U.S. state to legally permit online casino. That market got off to a slow start; however, online casino revenue in New Jersey has risen steadily over the last several years. Notably, online casino revenue was not negatively impacted when New Jersey began permitting online sports betting in 2018. Online casino revenue from slot machines and table games in New Jersey grew from $277.3 million in 2018 to $461.8 million in 2019 according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Furthermore, land-based casino revenue in New Jersey grew during that same period from $2.51 billion in 2018 to $2.69 billion in 2019 (a period largely unaffected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, showing that land-based casino revenue can grow at the same time that online casino revenue grows. This fact may serve as a catalyst for lawmakers in other states with land-based casinos to consider authorizing online casino.
In New Jersey in 2021, online casino revenue continued to increase to $1.34 billion while revenues from land-based casinos also increased to $2.55 billion, despite the effects of COVID-19 due to mandatory or requested stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of brick-and-mortar casinos. We believe this trend in online and land-based casino revenues for New Jersey from 2020 to 2021 is indicative of the expected longer-term trend of continued online and land-based casino revenue growth, in particular if the global COVID-19 pandemic starts to subside.
We believe that more states either have and will consider authorizing online casino for the following reasons, among others:
•We believe that COVID-19 has resulted in increased expenses and/or reduced tax revenue in many states, increasing the need for new sources of tax revenue.
•In states that have land-based casinos, COVID-19 caused temporary casino closures and/or lower patronage, which reduced tax revenue.
•We believe that COVID-19 has caused increased general consumer adoption of digital activity, including online gaming.
•Online casino generated more tax revenue compared to online sports betting in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in 2021, meaning authorizing online sports betting alone may not optimize tax revenue.
•Land-based casino revenue grew as online casino revenue grew in New Jersey from 2020 to 2021, demonstrating that land-based casino revenue can grow with online casino revenue.
•We believe that the land-based casino industry, an important stakeholder in many states, generally has shown a wider acceptance of online casino.
Both Pennsylvania and New Jersey were experiencing online casino taxable revenue growth prior to COVID-19; however, that growth accelerated in March 2020 and continued in large part through Q4 2021. The charts below highlight the growth of online slot and table games taxable revenue in New Jersey and Pennsylvania since Q4 2019:

U.S. Sports Betting
On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Profession and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA”) – a nationwide ban of sports betting – was unconstitutional, thus allowing states (beyond the few states that were grandfathered into PASPA by virtue of authorizing sports betting prior to PASPA) to enact their own sports betting laws. Since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, as of the date hereof, 32 states and the District of Columbia have authorized sports betting. Of those 33 jurisdictions, 22 states have authorized statewide online sports betting while 11 remain authorized for retail-only at casinos or retail locations.
According to EKG, the United States generated approximately $3.62 billion in online sports betting revenue in 2021. While the overall industry is still nascent, growth to date has been strong. For example, online gross revenue in New Jersey, the first state to regulate sports betting after PASPA was struck down, and Pennsylvania for the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 52% and 16% year-over-year, respectively, according to data from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement and the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.
U.S. Sports Betting Policy Landscape
Source: EKG United States Sports Betting Policy Monitor – Released February 2022
We believe the U.S. sports betting market still has significant opportunity for growth. Only approximately 41% of the United States currently has access to online sports betting, per EKG. This fact is significant when one considers that according to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, more than 97% of New Jersey sports betting revenue in January 2022 and more than 90% of the sports betting revenue in 2021 came via online betting. Populous states such as California, Florida and Texas have not yet legalized online sports betting. We believe the sports betting industry will grow significantly over the next several years as more states authorize sports betting and as current operating markets mature.
Share of Total Monthly Sports Betting Handle (December 2021) 
Source: EKG United States Sports Betting Market Monitor – Released February 2022
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, two states that offer online sports betting, accounted for approximately 27% of all U.S. sports betting handle in December 2021 according to EKG. In states that permit online and retail sports betting, online sports betting handle is generally higher than retail handle; however, some states have legalized retail sports betting only (e.g., New Mexico and Arkansas) while other states have legalized restricted forms of online sports betting (e.g., in-person registration required in Nevada and for a period of time in Iowa, Illinois and Rhode Island). As more states legalize and reduce restrictions around online sports betting, we expect that New Jersey and Pennsylvania will hold less dominant positions across the United States.
U.S. Online Gaming: Estimating the Total Addressable Industry Size
If every U.S. state was to legalize online casino, based on state level projections from EKG, it is projected that the U.S. market would generate approximately $29 billion in revenue. Similarly, if every U.S. state was to legalize online sports betting, based on state level projections from EKG, it is projected that the U.S. market would generate approximately $22 billion in revenue.
Latin America Gaming Industry
Latin America is another area of focus for us. Since 2018, we have been operating online gaming in Colombia, a country with a population of approximately 50 million. We believe this experience will enable us to expand further in Latin America and other countries as more markets become regulated. Online gaming is also authorized in Mexico, where we anticipate launching online casino and sports betting in the second quarter of 2022, and Brazil, which have populations of approximately 129.0 million and 209.5 million, respectively. Both Mexico and Brazil still have relatively low internet penetration, with 71% and 76%, respectively, of the population having internet access compared to 95% in the United States and 97% in the UK, so the expansion of internet penetration in these countries would allow us to grow our revenues from online gaming there to the extent we make our offerings available in those countries.
The highest populated country in Latin America, Brazil, legalized sports betting in December 2018. Before operators can launch sports betting in Brazil, the Brazilian government needs to adopt regulations and a licensing process. We believe given our experience and success in neighboring Colombia, we will be well-qualified to obtain a sports betting license in Brazil.
Competition
We operate in the global gaming and entertainment industry. Therefore, we generally view any type of discretionary leisure and entertainment provider to be a competitor with respect to our customers’ time and share of wallet. Specifically, in the online casino and sports betting space in the United States (our primary market), our competitors come from two main groups – (i) established online-first companies and (ii) bricks-and-mortar casino and similar gaming establishments. Established online-first companies in the U.S. market include companies such as Flutter Entertainment / The Stars Group (through their FanDuel and FoxBet brands), DraftKings (including through their Golden Nugget Online Gaming and theScore brands), 888, Roar Digital (through its BetMGM brand and partnership with GVC), Bet365, Betfred and PointsBet, among others. Additionally, we face competition from U.S. casinos such as Penn National Gaming through its Barstool brand, Hard Rock through its Hard Rock Digital brand, Caesars Entertainment through its partnership with William Hill, and Churchill Downs Incorporated. In addition, Circa Sports and Smarkets have recently entered the U.S. market.
We compete on a number of factors across our B2C offerings. These include, without limitation, our front-end online gaming platform, our back-end infrastructure, our ability to retain and monetize existing customers, re-engage prior customers and attract new customers, and our regulatory access, compliance and customer service experience.
In the B2B space, primarily in the retail sportsbook market, our competitors for include, without limitation, SBTech (which was acquired by DraftKings), US Bookmaking, International Gaming Technology (IGT), Kambi, Playtech and Scientific Games. We compete primarily on the quality and breadth of our technology solutions and support services.
Intellectual Property
Our business relies significantly on the creation, authorship, development, use and protection of intellectual property. This intellectual property consists of, for example, software code, proprietary technology, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents and trade secrets that we use to develop and provide our offerings and related services, as well as online betting and gaming content (both proprietary and licensed) and proprietary data acquired from our customers’ use of our offerings and related services.
We own the copyrights in the software code we author. From time to time, we may seek patent protection covering inventions we conceive and pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions.
We rely on common law rights or contractual restrictions to protect certain of our intellectual property rights, and we control access to our software source code and other trade secrets by entering into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties that have access to our software source code or trade secrets. From time to time, we may assert our rights in our intellectual property as appropriate or desirable against third parties who may be infringing such rights.
Some of the intellectual property we use is owned by affiliated entities or third parties, and we have entered into licenses and other agreements with applicable affiliated entities or third parties to obtain rights to use such intellectual property. Although we believe we have sufficient rights under such agreements for the intended operation of our business, such agreements often restrict our use of the third parties’ intellectual property and limit such use to specific time periods.
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, RSG and its affiliates assigned to us several of the trademarks and domain names that we use in connection with our business, and we granted to RSG and its affiliates a perpetual, royalty-free license to use certain of these trademarks and domain names in certain fields of use. This license may be either exclusive or non-exclusive based on the field of use and the particular trademark or domain name. This license precludes our use of certain trademarks and domain names in the exclusive fields of use.
We have a license agreement, as may be amended from time to time, with Rivers IP Holdings, LLC (“Rivers IP”), an affiliated entity, pursuant to which Rivers IP granted to us a fully paid-up, exclusive license for the use of the trademarks “Rivers,” “betrivers,” “betrivers.com” and domain names incorporating any of the foregoing trademarks, including the domain name “playsugarhouse.com” in each case in connection with real-money gaming and fantasy sports (only in jurisdictions where such activities are legal) and play-for-fun or free-to-play offerings (anywhere in the world). Either party may terminate this license by giving the other party 180 days’ written notice. This agreement provides us with a license to use the “Rivers,” “betrivers,” “betrivers.com” trademarks and domain names in jurisdictions in which RSG operates 
“Rivers” branded casinos. However, in those jurisdictions we received a sublicense from the applicable “Rivers” branded casinos to utilize such trademarks and domain names in connection with our operation of retail and online sports betting and online gaming under the casinos’ regulatory licenses. We also have similar license agreements, as may be amended from time to time, with Sugar House HSP Gaming, LP, pursuant to which we can use the “Sugarhouse” and “playsugarhouse” marks and related domains.
Third parties in the sports betting, online gaming and casino, technology and other industries may own patents, copyrights and trademarks and may occasionally threaten litigation or file suit against us or request us to enter into license agreements, in each case based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Occasionally we have received, and we expect to receive in the future, third-party allegations or cease-and-desist letters, including from our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed such parties’ intellectual property rights, such as their trademarks, copyrights, and patents. Such allegations may increase as our business grows.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate in the gaming and entertainment industry, in particular in the online gaming industry. These industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted or enforced in ways that could negatively impact our business.
The gaming industry (inclusive of our online casino and sports betting offerings) is highly regulated, and we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue in each jurisdiction in which we operate in order to continue our operations. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity, honesty and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in the gaming operations along with the integrity and security of the online casino and sports betting offerings. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect customers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:
•ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
•establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
•establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures;
•establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;
•maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
•maintain systems for reliable record keeping;
•file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
•establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and
•enforce minimum age and as applicable, location, requirements.
Typically, a U.S. state regulatory environment is established by statute and underlying regulations and is administered by one or more regulatory agencies (typically a gaming commission or state lottery) who regulate the affairs of owners, 
managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business:
•adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;
•interpret and enforce gaming laws and regulations;
•impose fines and penalties for violations;
•review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;
•grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;
•collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;
•review and approve certain transactions, which may include acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants and securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and
•establish and collect fees and taxes in jurisdictions where applicable.
While we believe that we comply in all material respects with all applicable sports betting and online casino laws, licenses and regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that our activities or the activities of our customers, partners or suppliers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement investigation, proceeding or other governmental action or that any such proceeding or action, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
In order to operate in certain jurisdictions, we must obtain either a temporary or permanent license or determination of suitability from the responsible authorities. We seek to ensure that we obtain all necessary licenses to develop and put forth our offerings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and where our customers are located.
Gaming laws generally require us, and each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our stockholders holding 5% or more of our outstanding equity, to obtain licenses from gaming authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining who must apply for a license or finding of suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction. When determining to grant a license to an applicant, gaming authorities generally consider: (i) the financial stability, good character, honesty, integrity and responsibility of the applicant (including verification of the applicant’s sources of funding); (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money gaming platform, hardware and related software, including the platform’s ability to operate in compliance with local regulation, as applicable; (iii) the applicant’s history; (iv) the applicant’s ability to operate its gaming business in a socially responsible manner; and (v) in certain circumstances, the effect on competition.
Gaming authorities may, subject to certain administrative procedural requirements: (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, revoke or suspend any license issued by them; (ii) impose fines, either on a mandatory basis or as a consensual settlement of a regulatory action; (iii) demand that named individuals or stockholders be disassociated from a gaming business; and (iv) in serious cases, liaise with local prosecutors to pursue legal action, which may result in civil or criminal penalties.
Events that may trigger revocation of a gaming license or another form of sanction vary by jurisdiction. However, typical events include, among others: (i) conviction in any jurisdiction of certain persons with an interest in, or key personnel of, the licensee of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment or may otherwise cast doubt on such person’s integrity; (ii) failure without reasonable cause to comply with any material term or condition of a gaming license; (iii) declaration of, or otherwise engaging in, certain bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or discontinuance activities, or an order or application with respect to the same; (iv) obtaining a gaming license by a materially false or misleading representation or in some other improper way; (v) violation of applicable anti-money laundering or terrorist financing laws 
or regulations; (vi) failure to meet commitments to customers, including social responsibility and responsible gaming commitments; (vii) failure to pay in a timely manner all gaming or betting taxes or fees due; or (viii) determination by the gaming authority that there is another material and sufficient reason to revoke or impose another form of sanction upon the licensee.
As noted above, in addition to us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming authorities generally also have the right to investigate individuals or entities having a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us or any of our subsidiaries, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable as a business associate. Specifically, as part of our obtaining sports betting and online casino licenses, certain of our officers, directors, and employees and in some cases, certain of our stockholders (typically, beneficial owners of 5% or more of a company’s outstanding equity, with most jurisdictions providing that “institutional investors” (as defined by a particular jurisdiction) can seek a waiver of these requirements) must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed or to qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Qualification and suitability determinations generally require the submission of extensive and detailed personal and financial disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes with respect to the individuals who occupy licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and in addition to the authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification or a finding of suitability, gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. If any director, officer, employee or significant stockholder is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required, to sever our relationship with such person. Furthermore, our charter provides that any equity interests of RSI owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates will be subject to mandatory sale and transfer to either RSI or one or more third party transferees and in such number and class(es)/series of equity interests as determined by the charter in good faith (following consultation with reputable outside and independent gaming regulatory counsel) pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of our Board of Directors (the “Board”).
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised that it is required by gaming authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action or our licenses may be in peril if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities.
Product-Specific Licensing
Online Casino
We currently offer online casino in Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, pursuant to licenses granted by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board and the West Virginia Lottery. In addition, we are currently pursuing a license in Ontario and have partnered with a licensed operator of online gaming in Mexico to offer online casino there in 2022.
Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law. At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (“UIGEA”), the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a state or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a state or foreign country in which such betting is legal. There is ongoing legal action as to whether the Wire Act applies beyond sports betting. A federal court of first instance has ruled that it does not.
Sports Betting
North America
In North America we currently operate our online sports betting offering via the PlaySugarHouse app in Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and the BetRivers app in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and Virginia pursuant to our licenses granted by the gaming commission of such states, specifically, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the Arizona Department of Gaming, the Colorado Division of Gaming, the Illinois Gaming Board, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the New York State Gaming Commission and the Virginia Lottery Board. We also operate retail sportsbooks in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan (see “Native American Gaming Regulation”), New York and Pennsylvania pursuant to applicable state and tribal licensing regimes, and anticipate operating a retail sportsbook in Ohio in the future.
On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that PASPA was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited a state from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Numerous states and territories already have laws authorizing and regulating some form of sports betting online or in bricks-and-mortar establishments. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level. See “Risk Factors — Risk Related to Government Regulation — Our business is subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing. Any change in regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to our business and offerings, or changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to our business and offerings, could adversely impact our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”
Native American Gaming Regulation
Gaming on Native American lands is governed by federal law, tribal-state compacts and tribal gaming regulations. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (the “IGRA”) provides the framework for federal and state control over all gaming on Native American lands and is administered by the National Indian Gaming Commission and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The IGRA requires that a tribe and the state in which the tribe is located enter into a written agreement, a tribal-state compact, which governs the terms of the gaming activities. Tribal-state compacts vary from state-to-state and in many cases require vendors to meet ongoing registration and licensing requirements. In addition, tribal gaming commissions have been established by many Native American tribes to regulate gaming-related activity on tribal lands. Through our subsidiaries, we provide play-for-fun sports betting and online casino services to Native American tribes who have negotiated compacts with their respective states and have received federal approval. Currently, we are authorized as a vendor to provide online casino and online and retail sports betting services to the Little River Casino Resort, a wholly owned and operated enterprise of the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, and we also provide certain social casino offerings to Coushatta Casino Resort, a gaming enterprise owned and operated by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.
South America
In Colombia, we operate our online casino and sports betting offering via a web-based solution. We also operate nine retail shops where customers can use provided terminals to place bets and make deposits and withdrawals. We operate pursuant to a concession contract with the Colombian gaming regulatory agency, Coljuegos Empresa Industrial Comercial Del Estado Administradora Del Monopolio Rentistico De Los Juegos De Suerte y Azar Linea Gratuita.
Data Protection and Privacy
In addition to our licensing regime for our offerings, we also take significant measures to protect our customers’ personal information and data.
We handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of our customers and employees, thus we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data. Regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, and regulations in other jurisdictions where we do not operate but that could otherwise impact our operations, 
such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario) may be new or are relatively untested laws (some of which may not yet be effective) that could affect our business, and the potential impact is unknown. We also handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of job applicants and employees in Estonia or the European Union, thus we are also subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union for such data.
Compliance
We have developed and implemented an internal compliance program designed to ensure that we comply with legal and regulatory requirements imposed on us in connection with our online casino and sports betting activities. Our internal compliance program focuses, among other things, on reducing and managing problematic gaming and providing tools to assist users in making educated choices related to gaming activities.
Additionally, we use various methods and tools across our operations such as geolocation blocking, which restricts access based on a user’s geographical location determined through a series of data points such as mobile devices and Wi-Fi networks; age verification to ensure our users are old enough to participate; routine monitoring of user activity; and risk-based user due diligence to ensure customer funds are legitimately derived. We have a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and collusion. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws and have developed appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the requirements of the evolving regulatory regimes, we cannot provide assurance that our compliance program will prevent all violations of applicable laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or our personnel will not result in a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.
We have built our online platform to meet the needs of differing regulatory regimes, including configurable regulatory and responsible gaming controls such as responsible gaming tests, operator alerts on customer behavior, deposit limits, betting limits, loss limits, timeout facilities, session limits, reality checks, balance thresholds and intended gaming amounts. These features are intended to provide our customers full control of their gaming to allow them to play responsibly.
Responsible and Safer Gaming
We view the safety and welfare of our customers as critical to our business and have made corresponding investments in our processes and systems to help ensure such safety and welfare. We are committed to industry-leading responsible gaming practices and seek to provide our customers with the resources and services they need to play responsibly. These practices, resources and services include deposit limits, voluntary restrictions on access and use of certain offerings, temporary self-exclusion and cooling-off periods, voluntary permanent exclusion from our offerings and applications and data science technology, which helps us flag any suspicious or abnormal betting activity. We also participate in national self-exclusion registers where they are in operation. We prominently promote our responsible gaming tools, resources and initiatives on our website and mobile applications. We also maintain a self-excluded customer list, which prohibits self-identified customers from placing bets or participating in real-money gaming and have embedded the software to limit or restrict the amount individual customers spend. We also train our frontline personnel to identify signs of problematic gaming, ensuring that we are not only utilizing data and technology but also our human resources.
In May 2019, we joined the National Council on Problem Gambling (“NCPG”) as a Platinum Member. The NCPG is the leading national organization for people and their families who are affected by problem gambling and gambling addiction. Our NCPG membership supports wide-ranging problem gambling prevention, treatment, education and research programs, as well as innovative responsible gambling policies provided by the NCPG. Our membership helps build on NCPG efforts, including the Safer Sports Betting Initiative and Internet Responsible Gambling Standards, which assist operators like us by providing best practice responsible gambling policies and procedures for all online gambling activities, including sports betting. We are also members of the Sports Wagering Integrity Monitoring Association and the American Gaming Association.
In 2021, we partnered with the AGA by participating in its “Have a Game Plan®” public service campaign, which brought together organizations across the gaming and sports industries to advance responsible sports wagering. As an official partner to the Chicago Bears, we leveraged our relationship to create a combined in-stadium message to raise awareness of our partnership with the AGA and show our support for the Have a Game Plan responsible gaming tools.
