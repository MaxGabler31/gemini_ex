Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to the business segments are acquired from a large number of domestic manufacturers and some materials are purchased from European and Southeast Asian sources.

The Industrial and Transportation Products segment uses various materials in the manufacture of its products. These include forgings and castings, steel fittings and hose packing consisting of silicone, cotton and copper wire. 5 suppliers provide over 35% of inventory purchases in this segment. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, the Company would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources.
 
Aluminum, the major raw material used in construction of the Commercial Air Handling units, is sourced from two major suppliers but is generally readily available from other sources. Copper is used by suppliers of a major component used in the product and the Company maintains relationships with three suppliers of these components to limit vulnerability. The Company maintains relationships with multiple suppliers for most of the other componentry used in assembly of the product, in order to maintain best costs for material and competitive lead times. The majority of materials for this segment are sourced domestically or from Canada.
 
The Company believes it has adequate sources of supply for its primary raw materials and components and has not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from its suppliers.
