Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Credex, a Florida corporation, was formed on September 2, 2005. The Company was formed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds for purchasing, servicing, managing and reselling of non-performing (defaulted) unsecured credit card debt portfolios to be acquired from financial institutions and distressed debt wholesalers. Since its inception, the Company derived no revenues and no income from such business and as result as of December 31, 2018, had an accumulated deficit of $366,329.
 
We are a development stage company with no revenues or operating history. Our address is 848 Rainbow Blvd, # 2096 Las Vegas, Nevada 89107. The telephone number is 801-243-5661. While our address is in Nevada, our sole officer and director currently operate our business from Utah without an office and through the use of phone and email.
 
The Company has attempted to attract private placement investments in the past. Thus far, the Company has not been able to implement its plans or begin operations because it has not been successful in raising the equity capital necessary to implement such plans.
 
There is no current public market for our securities. As our stock is not publicly traded, investors should be aware they probably will be unable to sell their shares and their investment in our securities is not liquid.
 
At the present time, we are classified as a “shell company” under Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on Rule 144 until: (1) we file Form 10 information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) when we cease to be a “shell company”; (2) we have filed all reports as required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for twelve consecutive months; and (3) one year has elapsed from the time we file the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting our status as an entity that is not a shell company.

Reorganization, Purchase or Sale of Assets
 
Other than the acquisition of the patent, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets involving the Company.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
The Company will be subject to numerous national, international, regional, state and local laws. The Company does not know when or whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned to be provided by the Company or which the Company intends to develop. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that any such future regulation may have on its business.
 
Research and Development Activities During the Last Two Years
 
We have not expended funds for research and development costs since inception.
 
Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We don’t anticipate material costs or expenses related to compliance with environmental laws. Hydrogen is a clean energy sector and there may be some tax incentives associated with this sector.
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
We currently have one employee, our executive officer, Russell Heaton. He devotes five (5) hours per week, to our business and currently is responsible for our general strategy, fund raising and customer relations. Once the offering is complete we will hire additional staff if we generate enough revenue to support the expense. The number of additional staff will depend upon our growth.
