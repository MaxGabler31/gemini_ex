​
eGain automates customer engagement with an innovative knowledge hub, powered by conversational AI and analytics. We sell mostly to large enterprises across financial services, telecommunications, retail, government, healthcare, and utilities. That is, organizations seeking to better serve customers at scale while coping with content silos, process complexity, and regulatory compliance. With our mantra of AX + BX + CX = DX™, we guide clients to effortless digital experience (DX) by holistically optimizing agent experience (AX), business experience (BX) and customer experience (CX). Leading brands use eGain’s cloud software to improve customer satisfaction, empower agents, reduce service cost, and boost sales. We are headquartered in the United States. We also operate in United Kingdom and India.
​
Industry Background 
Introduction
​
According to Gartner, 84% of contact center agents surveyed are not satisfied with their desktop tools. Our assessment, based on two decades of serving clients is that contact center agents when serving customers ignore most of the information piled on their screens across multiple windows and tabs. Meanwhile, most businesses expect agents to retain and routinely refresh all relevant knowhow in their head - across complex, expanding product portfolios and compliance-heavy processes. And recall it contextually in the moment of truth when serving customers. This growing knowledge and guidance gap for agents explains Gartner Research’s only technology recommendation for customer service and support leaders in 2022: invest in knowledge management tools! It is time to reimagine the Contact Center Agent Experience.
Digital Economy Demands Modern Software
In a world selling commoditized products to information-rich customers who are short on time, smart tools must automate the routine and augment the interesting across agent, business and customer tasks. This need has been amplified by the disruption of traditional work models by COVID. Coming out of the pandemic tunnel and dealing with the new normal of millennial employee expectations, businesses realize that they need to invest in tools to quickly and easily empower agents, while ensuring customer satisfaction and compliance. Not surprisingly, businesses are increasingly seeking modern knowledge management solutions to layer on top of traditional systems of record like CRM, contact centers, and content management. Their goal is to empower contact center agents and automate customer self-service with relevant knowledge everywhere.
Knowledge-Powered Customer Engagement
​
Energized by big-data, cloud-computing and AI technologies in a digital world, Knowledge Hubs can deliver transformational value in customer engagement. Smart, connected experiences can be automated to successfully resolve majority of customer interactions. The pressing challenge for solution buyers, however, is to separate the wheat from the chaff as they look for trusted, innovative, and aligned partners. So they seek sustained product leadership, at-scale proof points and no-risk trials.
Contact Centers are a Brand Battleground
​
Contact centers offer significant opportunity to automate customer engagement. Globally, there are close to 15 million contact center agents. Time-starved customers consuming complex products and grappling with marketing offers generate stubbornly high levels of customer contact. Furthermore, contact centers worldwide are undergoing a technology refresh cycle from on-premise call centers to cloud-based contact centers. This transition affords businesses the opportunity to reimagine and design customer contact strategies to drive digital-first automation, fueled by Knowledge and AI.
Customer Engagement Automation is a Large, Growing Market
​



Businesses are investing heavily in digital transformation, with customer engagement as a top priority. Cloud-based solutions and a growing Application Programming Interface (API) economy present exciting opportunities to connect, solve, and optimize customer interactions. As predicted by industry analysts, the number of customer interactions involving emerging technology such as machine-learning applications, chatbots, or mobile messaging is increasing every day. To effectively harness these novel capabilities, businesses are looking toward innovative platform providers with proof at scale to guide them on their automation journey.
​
The eGain Approach and Benefits
What Customers Want
​
Technology acceleration notwithstanding, human needs for customer engagement and service change slowly. We believe what customers still want is help in three categories: informational, transactional, and situational. Any given customer contact can morph across these categories as the conversation develops. Tools must orchestrate customer contact with context —accounting for machine-human hand-offs, channel switching, multimodal interaction, and conversational pause-and-resume. During these interactions, customers increasingly want to be guided, even anticipated. Siloed solutions like transactional, simplistic chatbots without contextual escalation or effective knowledge and guidance don’t work.
The eGain Solution is Comprehensive
​
eGain offers a comprehensive, unified Knowledge Hub solution to automate, augment and orchestrate customer engagement. Our feature-rich portfolio of applications empowers businesses to holistically connect, flexibly solve, and continuously optimize the experience for agents, businesses and customers. Our solution experts and partners guide clients by aligning with their strategic priorities and demonstrating quick value across a series of agile sprints.
Connect with eGain Conversation Hub
​
Our Conversation Hub offers comprehensive, scalable capabilities for digital-first, omnichannel interaction management within a modern, purpose-built desktop. Rich applications, powered by our Knowledge and AI capabilities (from our Knowledge Hub), proactively guide agents to efficiently interact with customers using messaging, short message service (SMS), chat, email, social media, phone, video, fax, and letter. As part of our Conversation Hub, we offer a novel Bring Your Own (BYO) architecture to plug in external bots, messaging channels, and third-party agent desktops to compose differentiated customer experiences. Finally, we offer a rich library of pre-built connectors to popular CRM, Contact Center, and Content Management platforms.
Solve with eGain Knowledge Hub
​
Our Knowledge Hub helps businesses to centralize knowledge, policies, procedures, and best-practices, while delivering guided, personalized solutions to customers and agents across all touch points. Our guided knowledge and virtual assistance applications ensure that all agents effectively resolve all contact types, regardless of product or procedure. Correct, compliant, and consistent responses across touchpoints boost customer satisfaction as first contact resolution surges and agent’s time to competency drops. 
​
Optimize with eGain Analytics Hub
​
Our Analytics Hub enables clients to measure, manage and orchestrate their omnichannel service operations. In addition, embedded AI and Machine Learning (ML) helps clients generate product improvement and customer insights, while spotting opportunities to improve experience and automate processes.
​



Open, Secure APIs and Third-Party Connectors Deliver Quick Value
​
Our open, secure platform APIs enable clients and partners to extend and enhance our solutions and to integrate with enterprise assets to enable a single view of the customer.

Direct Go-to-market Strategy, Complemented by a Growing Partner Ecosystem

We take our solutions to market through a direct sales model, primarily in North America and Western Europe. We complement direct sales with resell partnerships based on product connectors into Cloud Contact Center platforms, including Amazon, Avaya, Cisco, Five9 and Genesys. We also partner with System Integrators and Managed Service Providers.
Customers 
​
We mostly sell to large enterprises, which we define as businesses with over a billion dollars in annual revenue or government organizations. Approximately 90% of our annual recurring cloud revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (which we refer to as fiscal year 2022) came from such large enterprises.
​
We focus on the following verticals: financial services, telecommunication, retail, government, health care and utilities. For fiscal year 2022, North America (NA) and combined Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) revenue accounted for 73% and 27% of total revenue.
​
Two of our largest customers, who are also our partners, accounted for 21% and 11% of total revenue in fiscal year 2022. 
Competition 
​
We compete with application software providers, including LivePerson, Inc., NICE, Ltd, Oracle Corporation, and Verint Systems Inc.. In addition, we occasionally compete with some of our platform partners where some of our product capabilities overlap, including Five9, Genesys, Microsoft, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. 
​
Our target market is highly competitive and some of our competitors may have longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic partnerships and distribution channels, larger user bases, products and services with different functions, and feature sets and greater brand recognition than we have. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:


o | proven track record of customer success;
--+-----------------------------------------

​
Growth Strategy
​
We are investing in multiple programs to accelerate growth.




Invest in Direct Sales and Marketing
​
We are enhancing our digital marketing to boost brand awareness, based on client success, product leadership and no-risk trial offers. To complement our marketing investment, we significantly expanded our field sales team to increase high-touch presence in target accounts.
Develop New Partner Relationships
​
We are developing new partnerships with complementary platform providers (with large customer bases) to enhance their proposition with our Knowledge-powered customer engagement capabilities. Our Business Development team continues to develop and operationalize new partnerships.
Land and Expand in the Enterprise
​
With the sustained progress we have made in customer success, we see a replicable pattern emerging: land enterprise logos with a limited footprint in one business unit, demonstrate business value, and then expand in the enterprise. We believe we are increasing the value of investment in eGain for our clients by deeply integrating our capabilities via our enhanced APIs with enterprise assets like enterprise collaboration platforms, CRM systems, transaction and billing, and content sources.
​
Maintain Platform Leadership
​
Innovation is in our DNA. We are developing vertical solutions on our platform to better acquire and serve customers. We continue to enhance our core capabilities to improve usability and personalization.
​
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions
​
From time to time, we pursue inorganic strategies to strengthen our product portfolio. In 2014, we acquired Exony Limited, a provider of advanced contact center analytics software. Moving forward, we will look for strategic acquisitions that we believe will deliver compelling value faster than organic options.
​
​



Sales and Marketing
Sales Strategy 
​
Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts, mostly B2C enterprises, through a combination of our direct sales force and partners. These enterprises typically have thousands of customer service agents in their contact centers and, in the aggregate, communicate with billions of customers each year. We utilize thought leadership and other marketing events to demonstrate our leadership position in the customer engagement software market and highlight our customer successes. 
​
Our direct sales force is organized into teams that include field sales representatives and sales consultants. Our direct sales force is complemented by lead generation representatives and sales development representatives. We also complement our direct effort with sales alliances.
Marketing and Partner Strategy 
​
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand around innovative and robust products trusted by leading enterprises. We accomplish this via public relations, analyst relations, marketing communications and demand generation. We employ a wide range of marketing avenues to deliver our message, including print and digital, targeted electronic and postal mailing, email newsletters, and a variety of trade shows, seminars, webinars, and interest groups.
​
Our marketing group produces sales tools, including product collateral, customer case studies, demonstrations, and presentations. In addition, the group performs market analyses and customer reviews to identify and develop key partnership opportunities and product capabilities. 
​
We believe that our partners help extend the breadth and depth of our product offerings, drive market penetration, and augment our professional service capabilities. We believe these relationships are important to delivering successful, integrated products and services to our customers. Our partner portal, eGain Econet™, provides comprehensive sales, support and services information for channel partners. 
​
Subscription Services 
​
Our subscription services provide customers with access to our software on a cloud-based platform that we manage and offer on a subscription basis. These subscription services allow our customers to easily consume our product innovation without dealing with infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration. We generally offer these services through a 36-month contract, with pricing based on the number of agents or self-service sessions.
​
Professional Services 
​
Our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting, implementation, training, and managed services to deliver business value, drive customer success and build customer loyalty.


o | Consulting and Implementation Services. Our offering includes rapid implementation services, platform-based solution extension, and systems integration services. Our consultants work with customers to understand their requirements, analyze their business needs, and implement effective solutions.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer Support 
​
We offer 24 x 7 customer support via online and phone channels worldwide under support agreements. Our customer support centers are in United States, United Kingdom, and India. 
​
Research and Development
​
The market for our products changes rapidly and is characterized by evolving industry standards, swift changes in customer requirements, and frequent product introductions. 
​
We continuously analyze market and customer requirements and evaluate external technology that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, increase our lifetime customer value and expand our target market. Our product roadmap effectively combines build, partner, and buy options.
​
Intellectual Property 
​
We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property and other laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business.
​
As of June 30, 2022, we had 11 issued patents in the United States. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the United States, including one provisional filing and several non-provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2029 and 2035.
​
We continually assess the strength of our intellectual property protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Future applications may or may not receive the issuance of valid patents or registered trademarks. 
​
We routinely require our employees, customers, and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology, or business plans. In addition, we require employees to agree to surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, some of our license agreements with certain customers and partners require us to place the source code for our products into escrow. These agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against us, or if we materially breach a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party. 
​
Human Capital 
​
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefits; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. As of June 30, 2022, we had 691 employees, including 687 full-time employees, of which 231 were in product development, 252 in services and support, 148 in sales and marketing, and 60 in finance and administration. 
​
None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we believe our relations with our employees are good, our future performance depends largely upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by employment agreements requiring service for a defined period of time.
