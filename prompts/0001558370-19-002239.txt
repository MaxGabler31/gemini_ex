     Item 1.Business
     Mackinac Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”, or “Mackinac”) is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, (the “BHCA”) that was incorporated under the laws of the state of Michigan on December 16, 1974.  The Corporation changed its name from “First Manistique Corporation” to “North Country Financial Corporation” on April 14, 1998.  On December 16, 2004, the Corporation changed its name from North Country Financial Corporation to Mackinac Financial Corporation.  The Corporation is headquartered and located in Manistique, Michigan.  The mailing address of the Corporation is P.O. Box 369, 130 South Cedar Street, Manistique, Michigan 49854.
     In December of 2004, the Corporation was recapitalized with the net proceeds, approximately $26.2 million, from the issuance of $30 million of common stock in a private placement.  Commensurate with this recapitalization, the Corporation changed its name from North Country Financial Corporation to Mackinac Financial Corporation, and its subsidiary bank adopted the “mBank” identity early in 2005.
     On December 5, 2014, the Corporation completed its acquisition of Peninsula Financial Corporation (“PFC”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The Peninsula Bank.  PFC had six branch offices and $126 million in assets as of the acquisition date.  The results of operations due to the merger have been included in the Corporation’s results since the acquisition date.  The merger was effected by a combination of cash payments and the issuance of shares of the Corporation’s common stock to PFC shareholders.  Each share of PFC’s 288,000 shares of common stock was converted into the right to receive, at the shareholder’s election and subject to certain limitations (i) approximately 3.64 shares of the Corporation’s common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, or (ii) cash at $46.13 per share of common stock.  The conversion of PFC’s shares resulted in the issuance of 695,361 shares of the Corporation’s common stock and payment of $4.484 million in cash to the former PFC shareholders.
     On April 29, 2016, the Corporation completed its acquisition of The First National Bank of Eagle River (“Eagle River.”)  Eagle River had three branch offices and approximately $125 million in assets as of the acquisition date.  The results of operations due to the merger have been included in the Corporation’s results since the acquisition date.  The merger was effected by a cash payment of $12.5 million.
     On August 31, 2016, the Corporation completed its acquisition of Niagara Bancorporation (“Niagara”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, First National Bank of Niagara.  Niagara had four branch offices and approximately $67 million in assets. The results of operations due to the merger have been included in the Corporation’s results since the acquisition date.  The merger was effected by a cash payment of $7.325 million.
     On May 18, 2018, the Corporation completed its acquisition of First Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. (“FFNM”).  FFNM had seven branch offices, one of which was consolidated into an existing mBank branch office shortly after consummation of the transaction.  FFNM had approximately $318 million in assets.  The results of operations due to the merger have been included in the Corporation’s results since the acquisition date.  The merger was effected by the issuance of 2,146,378 new shares, approximating $34.1 million.
     On October 1, 2018, the Corporation completed its acquisition of Lincoln Community Bank (“Lincoln”).  Lincoln had two branch offices, one of which was subsequently closed at the end of 2018.  Lincoln had approximately $60 million in assets. The results of operations due to the merger have been included in the Corporation’s results since the acquisition date.  The merger was effected by a cash payment of $8.5 million.
     The Corporation owns all of the outstanding stock of its banking subsidiary, mBank (the “Bank”).  The Bank currently has 11 branch offices located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 10 branch offices located in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula, one branch in Southeast Michigan, and 7 branches in Wisconsin.  The Bank maintains offices in the Michigan counties of: Alpena, Cheboygan, Chippewa, Emmet,Grand Traverse, Luce, Manistee, Marquette, Menominee, Montmorency, Oakland, Oscoda, Otsego, and Schoolcraft.

 The Corporation also owns three non-bank subsidiaries: First Manistique Agency, presently inactive; First Rural Relending Company, a relending company for nonprofit organizations; and North Country Capital Trust, a statutory business trust which was formed solely for the issuance of trust preferred securities (none of which remain outstanding).  The Bank represents the principal asset of the Corporation.  The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, mBank Title Insurance Agency, LLC, which provided title insurance services until 2014 and is currently inactive.  The Corporation and the Bank are engaged in a single industry segment, commercial banking, broadly defined to include commercial and retail banking activities, along with other permitted activities closely related to banking.
     Operations
     The principal business of the Corporation is the general commercial banking business, conducted through the Bank’s provision of a full range of loan and deposit products.  These banking services include customary retail and commercial banking services, including checking and savings accounts, time deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, safe deposit facilities, real estate mortgage lending, commercial lending, commercial and governmental lease financing, and direct and indirect consumer financing.  Funds for the Bank’s operations are also provided by brokered deposits and through borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) system, proceeds from the sale of loans and mortgage-backed and other securities, funds from repayment of outstanding loans and earnings from operations.  Earnings depend primarily upon the difference between (i) revenues from loans, investments, and other interest-bearing assets and (ii) expenses incurred in payment of interest on deposit accounts and borrowings, an adequate allowance for loan losses, and general operating expenses.     Competition
     Banking is a highly competitive business.  The Bank competes for loans and deposits with other banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage bankers, and investment firms in the scope and type of services offered, pricing of loans, interest rates paid on deposits, and number and location of branches, among other things.  The Bank also faces competition for investors’ funds from mutual funds, marketable equity securities, and corporate and government securities.
     The Bank competes for loans principally through interest rates and loan fees, the range and quality of the services it provides and the locations of its branches.  In addition, the Bank actively solicits deposit-related clients and competes for deposits by offering depositors a variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, and other services.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation and its subsidiaries employed, in the aggregate, 294 employees.  The Corporation provides its employees with comprehensive medical and dental benefit plans, a life insurance plan, and a 401(k) plan.  None of the Corporation’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Corporation.  Management believes its relationship with its employees to be good.     Business
     The Bank makes mortgage, commercial, and installment loans to customers throughout Michigan and Northeastern Wisconsin.  Fees may be charged for these services.  The Bank’s most prominent concentration in the loan portfolio relates to commercial loans to entities within real estate — operators of nonresidential buildings industry.  This concentration represented $150.251 million, or 20.95%, of the commercial loan portfolio at December 31, 2018.  The Bank also supports the service industry, with its hospitality and related businesses, as well as gas stations and convenience stores, forestry, restaurants, farming, fishing, and many other activities important to growth in the regions we service.  The economy of the Bank’s market areas is affected by summer and winter tourism activities.
     The Bank has become a premier SBA/USDA lender in our regions.  Many of these SBA/USDA guaranteed loans are sold at a premium on the secondary market, with the Bank retaining the servicing.  The Bank does not sell the loan guarantees on every credit, rather only those where acceptable market rates are above par.
     The Bank also offers various consumer loan products including installment, mortgages and home equity loans.  In addition to making consumer portfolio loans, the Bank engages in the business of making residential mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market.

 On January 16, 2018, the Corporation executed a merger agreement with First Federal of Northern Michigan Bancorp, Inc. in Alpena, Michigan (“FFNM”).  On May 18, 2018, upon the consummation of the merger, with and into into the Corporation, the Coporation consolidated First Federal of Northern Michigan with the bank.  FFNM had seven branches, one of which was consolidated into an existing mBank branch shortly after consummation of the transaction. 
     On June 7, 2018 the Corporation announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire Lincoln Community Bank (“Lincoln”) located in Merrill, Wisconsin.  On October 1, 2018, upon consummation of the definitive agreement, the Corporation consolidated Lincoln into the Bank.  Lincoln operated two branches, one in each of Merrill and Gleason; As part of the acquisition the Gleason branch was subsequently closed at the end of 2018. 
     After the acquisition activity in 2018, the Bank’s presence increased to 29 branches.
     The Bank’s primary source for lending, investments, and other general business purposes is deposits.  The Bank offers a wide range of interest bearing and non-interest bearing accounts, including commercial and retail checking accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts, money market accounts with limited transactions, individual retirement accounts, regular interest-bearing statement savings accounts, certificates of deposit with a range of maturity date options, and accessibility to a customer’s deposit relationship through online banking.  The sources of deposits are residents, businesses and employees of businesses within the Bank’s market areas, obtained through the personal solicitation of the Bank’s officers and directors, direct mail solicitation and limited advertisements published in the local media.  The Bank also utilizes the wholesale deposit market for any shortfalls in loan funding.  No material portions of the Bank’s deposits have been received from a single person, industry, group, or geographical location.
     The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis (“FHLB”).  The FHLB provides an additional source of liquidity and long-term funds.  Membership in the FHLB has provided access to attractive rate advances, as well as advantageous lending programs.  The Community Investment Program makes advances to be used for funding community-oriented mortgage lending, and the Affordable Housing Program grants advances to fund lending for long-term low and moderate income owner occupied and affordable rental housing at subsidized interest rates.
     The Bank has secondary borrowing lines of credit available to respond to deposit fluctuations and temporary loan demands.  The unsecured lines totaled $64.0 million at December 31, 2018, with additional amounts available if collateralized.
     As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had no material risks relative to foreign sources.  See the “Interest Rate Risk” and “Foreign Exchange Risk” sections in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7A below, for details on the Corporation’s foreign account activity.
     Compliance with federal, state, and local statutes and/or ordinances relating to the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon the Bank’s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
     Supervision and Regulation
     As a registered bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) under the BHCA.  The Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (the “DIFS”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).
     Under the BHCA, the Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require.  In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Corporation might not do so absent such policy.  In addition, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations which regulate the activities of the Corporation, the Bank and the non-bank subsidiaries, including requirements and limitations relating to capital and reserve requirements, permissible investments and lines of business, transactions with affiliates, loan limits, mergers and acquisitions, issuances of securities, dividend payments, inter-affiliate liabilities, extensions of credit and branch banking.
     Federal banking regulatory agencies have established risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among 

 
  4

 
banks and bank holding companies.  The resulting capital ratios represent qualifying capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.  The guidelines are minimums, and the federal regulators have noted that banks and bank holding companies contemplating expansion programs should not allow expansion to diminish their capital ratios and, “should maintain all ratios well in excess” of the minimums.  The current ratios, and pending changes are discussed under Regulatory Capital Requirements below.
     The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act contains “prompt corrective action” provisions pursuant to which banks are to be classified into one of five categories based upon capital adequacy, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized” and which require (subject to certain exceptions) the appropriate federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to an institution which becomes “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized”.  The FDIC also, after an opportunity for a hearing, has authority to downgrade an institution from “well capitalized” to “adequately capitalized” or to subject an “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” institution to the supervisory actions applicable to the next lower category, for supervisory concerns.  Information pertaining to the Corporation’s and the Bank’s capital is contained in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 below, as well as in Note 16 to the Corporation’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.
     Current federal law provides that adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies from any state may acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state, subject to certain conditions.
     In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), which eliminated certain barriers to and restrictions on affiliations between banks and securities firms, insurance companies and other financial service organizations.  Among other things, GLBA repealed certain Glass-Steagall Act restrictions on affiliations between banks and securities firms, and amended the BHCA to permit bank holding companies that qualify as “financial holding companies” to engage in a broad list of “financial activities,” and any non-financial activity that the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines is “complementary” to a financial activity and poses no substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system.  GLBA treats lending, insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investment, financial advisory, securities underwriting, dealing and market-making, and merchant banking activities as financial in nature for this purpose.
     Under GLBA, a bank holding company may become certified as a financial holding company by filing a notice with the Federal Reserve Board, together with a certification that the bank holding company meets certain criteria, including capital, management, and Community Reinvestment Act requirements.  The Corporation is not currently required to qualify as a financial holding company.
     Privacy Restrictions
     GLBA, in addition to the previously described changes in permissible non-banking activities permitted to banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies, also requires financial institutions in the U.S. to provide certain privacy disclosures to customers and consumers, to comply with certain restrictions on sharing and usage of personally identifiable information, and to implement and maintain commercially reasonable customer information safeguarding standards.  The Corporation believes that it complies with all provisions of GLBA and all implementing regulations, and the Bank has developed appropriate policies and procedures to meet its responsibilities in connection with the privacy provisions of GLBA.
     The USA PATRIOT Act
     In 2001, Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”).  The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money.  The USA PATRIOT Act mandates financial services companies to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to, or additional measures designed to address, any or all of the following matters, among others: money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, and currency crimes.

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act
     On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  This legislation addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters, including:
    
· | The creation of a five-member oversight board that will set standards for accountants and have investigative and disciplinary powers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The prohibition of accounting firms from providing various types of consulting services to public clients and requiring accounting firms to rotate partners among public client assignments every five years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increased penalties for financial crimes;
--+------------------------------------------


· | Expanded disclosure of corporate operations and internal controls and certification of financial statements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced controls on, and reporting of, insider training; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Prohibition on lending to officers and directors of public companies, although the Bank may continue to make these loans within the constraints of existing banking regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Among other provisions, Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement or omission of a material fact.  Specific requirements of the certifications include having these officers confirm that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and Audit Committee about our internal controls; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their evaluation.
     In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC’s rules and regulations thereunder require our management to evaluate, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness, as of the end of each fiscal year, of our internal control over financial reporting.  Our management must then provide a report of management on our internal over financial reporting that contains, among other things, a statement of their responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and a statement identifying the framework they used to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
     On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) into law.  The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening safety and soundness for the financial services sector.  A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below:
· | Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision.
--+------------------------------------------------------

      The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies.  These new standards are described below.  The Dodd-Frank Act also increased regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency.
    
· | Federal Deposit Insurance.
--+---------------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits and provided unlimited federal deposit insurance on noninterest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions through December 31, 2012.  Subsequent to 2012, these amounts reverted from unlimited insurance to $250,000 coverage per separately insured depositor.  The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) and increased the floor on the size of the DIF.

· | The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
--+---------------------------------------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, responsible for implementing, examining and, for large financial institutions of $10 billion or more in total assets, enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws.  Because we have under $10 billion in total assets, however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will still continue to examine us at the federal level for compliance with such laws.
    
· | Interest on Demand Deposit Accounts.
--+-------------------------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposit accounts effective July 21, 2011, thereby permitting depository institutions to now pay interest on business checking and other accounts.
    
· | Mortgage Reform.
--+-----------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act provided for mortgage reform addressing a customer’s ability to repay, restricted variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and made more loans subject to requirements for higher-cost loans, new disclosures and certain other restrictions.
    
· | Interstate Branching.
--+----------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act allows banks to engage in de novo interstate branching, a practice that was previously significantly limited.
    
· | Interchange Fee Limitations.
--+-----------------------------

      The Dodd-Frank Act gave the Federal Reserve Board the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by a payment card issuer that, together with its affiliates, has assets of $10 billion or more and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer.  The Federal Reserve Board has rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge a merchant for a transaction to the sum of 21 cents and five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to one cent for fraud prevention costs.  While we are not directly subject to such regulations since our total assets do not exceed $10 billion, these regulations may impact our ability to compete with larger institutions who are subject to the restrictions.
     The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations in addition to those discussed above.  The CFPB has issued significant new regulations that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing.  Those regulations became effective in January 2014.  In addition, the CFPB issued new regulations that changed the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act effective October 3, 2015.  Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB will likely result in additional costs, which could be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
     The Economic Growth, Regulator Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018
     On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory and Consumer Protection Act of 2018             (the “EGRRCPA) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks.  The EGRRCPA’s highlights include, among other things: (i) creating a new category of “qualified mortgages” presumed to satisfy ability-to-repay requirements for loans that meet certain criteria and are held in portfolio by banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not require appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempt banks that originate fewert than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from 

 
  7

 
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarify that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurane would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; and (v) simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status.
    
     Regulatory Capital Framework
     On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve and OCC approved a final rule to establish a new comprehensive regulatory capital framework for all US banking organizations, with an effective date of January 1, 2015.  The Regulatory Capital Framework (“Basel III”) implements several changes to the US regulatory capital framework required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The new US capital framework imposed higher minimum capital requirements, additional capital buffers above those minimum requirements, a more restrictive definition of capital, and higher risk weights for various enumerated classifications of assets, the combined impact of which effectively results in substantially more demanding capital standards for US banking organizations.
     The Basel III final rule established a common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) requirement, a Tier 1 capital requirement of 6.0% and an 8.0% total capital requirement.  The new CET1 and minimum Tier 1 capital requirements became effective January 1, 2015.  In addition to these minimum risk-based capital ratios, the Basel III final rule required that all banking organizations maintain a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of CET1 in an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in order to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions and to pay certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  In order to avoid those restrictions, the capital conservation buffer effectively increased the minimum CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios for US banking organizations to 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively.  Banking organizations with capital levels that fall within the buffer will be required to limit dividends, shares repurchases or redemptions (unless replaced within the same calendar quarter by capital instruments of equal or higher quality), and discretionary bonus payments.  The capital conservation buffer has phased in, in full beginning January 1, 2019.
    
 | Adequately | | Well-Capitalized 
 | Capitalized | Well-Capitalized | with Buffer, fully
 | Requirement | Requirement | phased in 2019 
Leverage | 4.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% 
CET1 | 4.5% | 6.5% | 7.0% 
Tier 1 | 6.0% | 8.0% | 8.5% 
Total Capital | 8.0% | 10.0% | 10.5% 

      As required by Dodd-Frank, the Basel III final rule requires that capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred shares be phased out of Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016, for banking organizations that had $15 billion or more in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 and permanently grandfathers as Tier 1 capital such instruments issued by these smaller entities prior to May 19, 2010 (provided they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital).
     The Basel III final rule provides banking organizations under $250 billion in total consolidated assets or under $10 billion in foreign exposures with a one-time “opt-out” right to continue excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive income from CET1 capital.  The election to opt-out must be made on the banking organization’s first Call Report filed after January 1, 2015.  The Corporation has elected to opt-out and continues to exclude Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income from its regulatory capital.
     The Basel III final rule requires that goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets), net of associated deferred tax liabilities, be deducted from CET1 capital.  Additionally, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, net of associated deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances, are fully deducted from CET1 capital.  However, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, along with mortgage servicing assets and “significant” (defined as greater than 

 
  8

 
10% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the unconsolidated financial institution) investments in the common stock of unconsolidated “financial institutions” are partially includible in CET1 capital, subject to deductions defined in the final rule.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EGRRCPA is expected to simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such instituions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules.  Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized, although the regulators retain the flexibility to determine that the institution may not qualify for the community bank leverage ratio test based on the institution’s risk profile.  Until the community bank leverage ratio is established by the regulators in accordance with EGRRCPA, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect.  The effective date and the specific community bank leverage ratio is currently unknown.
     Information regarding the Corporation and the Bank’s regulatory capital can be found in Note 16 – Regulatory Matters in the financial statements included herein.
     Monetary Policy
     The earnings and business of the Corporation and the Bank depends on interest rate differentials.  In general, the difference between the interest rates paid by the Bank to obtain its deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rates received by the Bank on loans extended to its customers and on securities held in the Bank’s portfolio, comprises the major portion of the Bank’s earnings.  These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Bank, and accordingly, its earnings and growth will be subject to the influence of economic conditions, generally, both domestic and foreign, including inflation, recession, unemployment, and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board.  The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies designed to curb inflation, combat recession, and promote growth through, among other means, its open-market dealings in US government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements, through adjustments to the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, and by adjusting the Federal Funds Rate, the rate charged in the interbank market for purchase of excess reserve balances.  In addition, legislative and economic factors can be expected to have an ongoing impact on the competitive environment within the financial services industry.  The nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the Bank cannot be predicted with certainty.     Selected Statistical Information

      IV.Summary of Loan Loss Experience
     A.Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses
     Changes in the allowance for loan losses arise from loans charged off, recoveries on loans previously charged off by loan category, and additions to the allowance for loan losses through provisions charged to expense.  Factors which influence management’s judgment in determining the provision for loan losses include establishing specified loss allowances for selected loans (including large loans, nonaccrual loans, and problem and delinquent loans) and consideration of historical loss information and local economic conditions.
