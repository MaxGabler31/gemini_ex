 Our Industry
 Outsourcing engineering and manufacturing services enable OEMs to concentrate on their core strengths, such as research and development, branding, and marketing and sales. In an outsourcing model, OEMs also benefit from improved efficiencies and reduced production costs, volume purchasing leverage, reduced fixed capital investments, improved inventory management, and access to global engineering and manufacturing resources. OEMs continue to turn to outsourcing partners to reduce time-to-market and time-to-volume production through utilization of their service providers’ product design and engineering services, technology solutions and manufacturing services.
 Outsourcing rates fluctuate periodically, and not all industries we serve are outsourcing at the same growth rates. The traditional markets of computing and telecommunications have used the outsourcing model for a number of years and have a lower outsourcing growth potential than the less-outsourced medical, complex industrials, A&D, and semi-cap markets, which we identify as our higher-value markets. The higher-value markets typically provide the opportunity for increased value-add which leads to higher profitability than the traditional markets and in some cases provide the potential for stable growth. The higher-value markets also align well with our expertise in more complex and highly regulated products, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on increased outsourcing in these markets.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be the solutions provider of choice to leading OEMs that we believe offer the greatest potential for profitable growth. To meet this goal, we have implemented the following strategies:
 •Focus on More Complex Products for Customers. EMS providers serve a wide range of OEMs in different industries, offering scalable electronics assembly as a service. The product scope ranges from 


easy-to-assemble, low-cost, high-volume products targeted for the consumer market to complicated, state-of-the-art, mission-critical products. Higher-volume manufacturing customers in the more traditional markets of computing and telecommunications often compete on price with short product life cycles and require less value-add from EMS providers. We focus on lower-volume manufacturing customers in the A&D, medical, and industrial markets, which are often in highly regulated industries where they are increasingly outsourcing higher value-added services to their EMS providers to meet stringent regulatory and time-to-market requirements. In the traditional markets, we focus on customers with more complex requirements such as high-performance computing and next generation telecommunications. In the higher-value markets where outsourcing growth rates are increasing and product life cycles are longer, we focus on customers where there is a strong match between our capabilities and their needs. Our objective is to achieve annual sales from higher-value market customers around 80% of total revenue which may fluctuate from period-to-period based on the mix of revenue between sectors.
 •Lead with Design & Engineering Services and Leverage Advanced Technology Solutions. In addition to strength in manufacturing complex high-density PCBAs, complex mechanical systems, and full systems integration, we offer customers specialized and tailored advanced design solutions, including technology building blocks and engineering services. We provide this engineering expertise through our design centers in the United States and Mexico (Americas), Asia and Europe. Leading with engineering is important to our strategy to increase sales to customers in our targeted higher-value markets where products require high quality, extreme reliability and low product failure rates. By leveraging our advanced technology and engineering solutions, customers can focus on core branding and marketing initiatives while we focus on bringing their products to market faster and more efficiently.
 •Maintain and Develop Close, Long-Term Relationships with our Customers. Our strategy is focused on establishing long-term relationships with leading OEMs in growth industries by becoming an integral part of their concept-to-production and full product life cycle requirements. To accomplish this, we rely on our business development executives, account managers, site program managers and general management teams to respond with speed and flexibility to frequently changing customer design specifications and production requirements. We focus on caring for our customers and ensuring that their needs are consistently met or exceeded.
 •Deliver Complete Manufacturing Solutions Globally. OEMs increasingly require a wide range of specialized design engineering and manufacturing services from EMS providers in order to reduce costs and accelerate their time-to-market and time-to-volume production. Building on our integrated engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we offer services from initial product design and test to final product assembly and distribution to OEM customers. Our precision technology services and complex mechanical manufacturing, along with our systems integration assembly and direct order fulfillment services, allow our customers the potential to reduce product cost and risk of product obsolescence by reducing their total work-in-process and finished goods inventory. These services are available at many of our manufacturing locations and allow us to offer customers the flexibility to move quickly from design and initial product introduction to production and distribution. We also offer our customers the opportunity to combine the benefits of low-cost manufacturing with the benefits and capabilities of our higher complexity support in Americas, Asia and Europe.
 •Continue to Seek Cost Savings and Operational Excellence. We seek to optimize our network of facilities to provide cost-efficient services for our customers. We have a global culture of continuous improvement, sharing best practices and implementing lean principles. We will continue to drive lean and operational excellence initiatives with common global processes that allow us to optimize our cost structure and capacity. Our customers benefit from these initiatives by sharing in the cost savings and knowing that their manufacturing partner can scale to meet their growth needs.
 •Optimize our Global Footprint. We will continue to evaluate our global footprint to ensure we are improving the utilization of our facilities, expanding in the regional locations where customers would like to do business with us, and investing capital in new capabilities that match identified market needs. This effort has led to some site closures and site expansion across our network as appropriate.
•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Our capabilities have continued to expand through acquisitions, and we will continue to selectively seek acquisitions which expand our core technology capabilities and expand the value of our services to new and existing customers. 
 •Capital Allocation. In support of our financial goals, we will continue a strong focus on cash conversion and appropriate capital management. We continue to be focused on effective capital deployment by balancing appropriate investments to support ongoing business and driving organic growth while providing returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Future investments may include augmenting internal technical capabilities complemented by targeted acquisitions.

Supply Chain, Order Fulfillment, and Aftermarket Support Services:
 Our customers often face challenges in designing supply chains, demand planning, procuring materials and managing their inventories efficiently due to fluctuations in their customer demand, product design changes, short product life cycles and component price fluctuations.
 We employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and lean manufacturing principles to manage procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost-effective manner so that, where possible, components arrive on a just-in-time, as-and-when-needed basis. Because we are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials, we are generally able to capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts, obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply, and return excess components. Utilizing our agility and expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain, we strive to help reduce our customers’ cost of goods sold and inventory exposure. However, due to the COVID pandemic, as well as global labor and supply disruptions, we continue to see component supply chain constraints across all commodity categories that are constraining our ability to produce the full demand forecasts we are receiving from customers.
 In support of our engineering services, technology solutions and manufacturing services, we offer our customers a wide array of capabilities from early supply chain design, to order fulfillment, to aftermarket services.
 •Value-Added Support Systems. We support our engineering, manufacturing, distribution and aftermarket support services with an efficient supply chain management system and a superior quality management program. Our value-added support services are primarily implemented and managed through a web-based information technology system that enables us to collaborate with our customers throughout all stages of the engineering, manufacturing and order-fulfillment processes.
 •Supply Chain Management. We offer full end-to-end supply chain design, inventory-management and volume-procurement capabilities to provide assurance of supply, optimized cost, and reduced total cycle time. Our materials strategy focuses on leveraging our procurement volume company-wide while providing local execution for maximum flexibility. We employ a full complement of electronic data interchange transactions with our suppliers to coordinate forecasts, orders, reschedules, and inventory and component lead times. Our ERP systems provide product and production information to our supply chain management, engineering change management and floor control systems. Our information systems include a proprietary module that controls serialization, production and quality data for all of our facilities around the world using state-of-the-art statistical process control techniques for continuous process improvements. To enhance our ability to rapidly respond to changes in our customers’ requirements by effectively managing changes in our supply chain, we utilize web-based interfaces and real-time supply chain management software products, which allow for scaling operations to meet customer needs, shifting capacity in response to product demand fluctuations, reducing materials costs and effectively distributing products to our customers or their end-customers.


•Direct Order Fulfillment. We provide direct order fulfillment for some of our OEM customers. Direct order fulfillment involves receiving customer orders, configuring products to quickly fill the orders and delivering the products either to the OEM, a distribution channel or directly to the end customer. We manage our direct order fulfillment processes using a core set of common systems and processes that receive order information from the customer and provide comprehensive supply chain management, including procurement and production planning. These systems and processes enable us to process orders for multiple system configurations and varying production quantities, including single units. Our direct order fulfillment services include build-to-order (BTO) and configure-to-order (CTO) capabilities. BTO involves building a complete system in real-time to a highly customized configuration ordered by the OEM’s end customer. CTO involves configuring systems to an end customer’s specifications at the time the product is ordered. The end customer typically places this order by choosing from a variety of possible system configurations and options. We are capable of meeting a 2- to 24-hour turnaround time for BTO and CTO fulfillment. We support our direct order fulfillment services with logistics that include delivery of parts and assemblies to the final assembly site, distribution and shipment of finished systems, and processing of customer returns.
 •Aftermarket Non-Warranty Services. We provide our customers a range of aftermarket non-warranty services, including repair, replacement, refurbishment, remanufacturing, exchange, systems upgrade and spare part manufacturing throughout a product’s life cycle. These services are tracked and supported by specific information technology systems that can be tailored to meet our customers’ individual requirements.
 Marketing and Customers
 We market our services and solutions primarily through a direct sales force organized by market sector. In addition, our engineering, operational, and executive management teams are an integral part of our sales and marketing approach. We generally enter into master supply agreements with our customers. These arrangements generally govern the conduct of our business with customers relating to, among other things, the design and manufacturing of products that in some cases were previously produced by the customer. The arrangements also generally identify the specific products to be designed and manufactured, quality and production requirements, product pricing and materials management. There can be no assurance that these arrangements will remain in effect or be renewed, but we focus intently on customer care in an effort to anticipate and meet the current and future needs of our customers.
 Our key customer accounts are supported by dedicated teams directly responsible for account management. These teams coordinate activities across the Benchmark global network to effectively satisfy customer requirements and have direct access to leadership and executive management to quickly address customer concerns. Local program managers and customer account teams further support the global teams and are linked by a comprehensive communications and information management infrastructure. In addition, our executive management is heavily involved in customer relations and devotes significant attention to broadening existing and developing new customer relationships.
 The following table sets forth the percentages of our sales by sector for 2021, 2020 and 2019.
 

Higher-Value Markets | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Industrials | | 20 | % | | 18 | % | 20 | %
A&D | | 15 | | | 21 | | | 
Medical | | | | | 24 | | 20 | 
Semi-Cap | | 26 | | | 18 | | 12 | 
 | | 81 | % | | 81 | % | 71 | %


Traditional Markets | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
Computing | | 9 | % | | 8 | % | 16 | %
Telecommunications | | | | | | | 13 | 
 | | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 29 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
A substantial percentage of our sales are made to a small number of customers and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Sales to our ten largest customers represented 47%, 41% and 38% of our sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales to Applied Materials represented 16% and 12% of our total sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2019, no single customer represented 10% or more of our total sales.


Seasonality
 Seasonality in our business has historically been driven by customer complexity and product mix, particularly the industries that our customers serve. Although we have historically experienced higher sales during the fourth quarter, this pattern does not repeat itself every year. In addition, we typically experience our lowest sales volume in the first quarter of each year.
Suppliers
 We maintain a network of suppliers of components and other materials used in our operations. We procure components when a purchase order or forecast is received from a customer and occasionally utilize components or other materials for which a supplier is the single source of supply. If any of these single-source suppliers were unable to provide these materials, a shortage of components could temporarily interrupt our operations and lower our profits until an alternate component could be identified and qualified for use. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Shortages or price increases of components specified by our customers have delayed and are expected to continue delaying shipments and may adversely affect our profitability” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Although we have experienced component shortages and longer lead times for various components, particularly with regard to supply disruptions due to COVID, we continually strive to reduce the impact of component shortages by working with customers to reschedule deliveries and with suppliers to provide the needed components using just-in-time inventory programs, or by purchasing components at slightly higher prices from distributors rather than directly from manufacturers. In addition, by developing long-term relationships with suppliers, we endeavor to minimize the effects of component shortages compared to manufacturers without such relationships. The goal of these procedures is to reduce our inventory risk. However, due to the COVID pandemic, as well as global labor and supply disruptions, we continue to see component supply chain constraints across all commodity categories that are constraining our ability to produce the full demand forecasts we are receiving from customers.
Competition
 The services we provide are available from many independent sources as well as from the in-house manufacturing capabilities of current and potential customers. Our competitors include Celestica Inc., Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., Plexus Corp and Sanmina Corporation. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our targeted markets are engineering solutions capabilities, product quality, flexibility, cost and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, reliability in meeting product delivery schedules, pricing, technological sophistication and geographic location.
 In addition, original design manufacturers (ODMs) that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in traditional markets, such as computing and telecommunication. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into or beyond these markets.
 Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) & Sustainability
 Benchmark continues to evolve and improve upon its ESG strategy and is implementing and managing long-term, strategic sustainability initiatives. The Nominating, Sustainability and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is sponsoring this effort and in 2020, Benchmark established an ESG/Sustainability Council.

 •We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
 •We engage our employees to accomplish this by conserving energy; reducing consumption of natural resources; preserving air, soil, and water quality, managing waste properly and encouraging reuse or recycling; reducing use of toxic substances and applying an ethical approach to source reduction and disposal efforts.
 •All Benchmark manufacturing facilities are either currently certified or undergoing certification to ISO 14001, which is a set of standards related to environmental management and systems. The ISO 14001 standards help organizations minimize adverse impacts to the environment, comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, and achieve continual improvement in these areas.
 •Benchmark has launched a number of global initiatives designed to reduce energy consumption in our facilities, including upgrades and or retrofits in LED and motion detector lighting, solar panels, cooling towers, compressed air and vacuum systems, and exhaust fans. 
Care for Our People:
 •We believe in upholding the principle of human rights, worker safety and observing fair labor practices within our organization and our supply chain.
 •We embrace diverse viewpoints and perspectives, recognizing that greater inclusion fosters innovation and achieves better decision making and financial results. Thus, we are strengthening our diversity, equity and inclusion programs with a planned set of actions around organizational training, refreshed company values, and a revitalized recruitment strategy. For additional information, see "—Human Capital Management" below.
 •We are committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of our employees, such as the implementation of 6S lean management concepts (sort, set, shine, standardize, sustain, and safety) and visual management practices, developing, implementing and continuously improving our Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and providing appropriate education, reporting and controls.
 •We are committed to participating in the development of our surrounding communities and supporting diversity.
 •In the fall of 2019, a strategic customer presented a Benchmark operation with a “Supplier ESG Excellence Award” for their “participation, leadership and superiority during the Forced and Bonded Labor Prevention Program.”
 Ethics & Corporate Responsibility:
 •We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance, promoting business ethics and integrity, and embracing diversity, equity and inclusion in the boardroom and throughout the organization.
 •We are committed to observing fair, transparent and accountable operating practices.
 •Benchmark believes that its ultimate responsibility is to help create and foster the best possible work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we implemented a “Speak Up!” campaign designed to promote a positive and ethical organizational culture. We believe that each team member, regardless of position, shares in this responsibility, and we encourage all of them to “Speak Up!” with questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues, questions about company policies, suggestions about how we can make our organization better and to address any other concerns.
 •To facilitate open and honest communication, in 2018 we upgraded our whistleblower Helpline to include global local phone numbers, together with language support, that allows reporters to “Speak Up!” in over 150 native languages. In addition, we added a web portal that allows online reporting of concerns, a place to ask questions, or quickly access ethics and compliance policies. 
 •We believe these efforts strengthen our enterprise ethics and compliance efforts and foster the environment where employees and stakeholders can express and have concerns resolved.


Supply Chain Responsibility:
 •We are committed to sourcing with suppliers willing to support our sustainability initiatives.
 •Benchmark endorses the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)(formerly the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition or EICC) Code of Conduct, which provides guidance in five critical areas of corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance, including labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. Benchmark also seeks the same endorsement from our business partners, requesting that each business partner adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent at initial engagement and flowing these requirements through our commercial contracts to our business partners and supply chain. Benchmark also conducts a supply chain monitoring system to assess adherence in these areas with regard to our supply chain partners.
 •Benchmark also endorses EcoVadis, a provider of sustainability ratings, intelligence and collaborative performance improvement tools for global supply chains. The EcoVadis methodology evaluates criteria across four themes: environment, fair labor practices, ethics/fair business practices and supply chains. In 2021, Benchmark was again awarded the EcoVadis Silver Medal-Sustainability rating, placing it in the upper quartile of EcoVadis rated companies.
 •Benchmark also supports Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act (Conflict Minerals Law) and efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Conflict Minerals Law and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, Benchmark adopted the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seeks to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from its suppliers, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. Benchmark does not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and is in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants. Benchmark therefore expects:
 -our suppliers to source 3TG only from smelters and refiners validated as being conflict free and that do not directly or indirectly benefit or finance armed groups in the DRC or other covered country;
 -our suppliers to fully-comply with the Conflict Minerals Law and provide all necessary declarations;
 -our suppliers to pass these requirements through to their supply chain and determine the source and chain of custody of specified minerals, including 3TG; and any suppliers not willing to comply with these requirements shall be reviewed by our global procurement team with regard to future business and sourcing declarations. This conflict minerals policy encourages our suppliers to respect and protect human rights throughout the world.
 Human Capital Management
 Our employees are an indispensable contributor to our success. Only an inspired community of talented employees enable us to realize our Company Vision to “positively impact lives by solving complex challenges with our customers, creating innovative products that no one imagined were possible.”
 We believe we have a responsibility to foster the best possible work environment for everyone in our organization through sound ethical and organizational governance, by promoting business ethics and integrity, and by embracing equality, diversity and inclusion throughout our organization. For additional information, see “—Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) & Sustainability—Ethics & Corporate Responsibility,” above.
Purpose and Culture
 
Benchmark focuses on delivering an engaging employee experience for our team members, creating a workplace where they can build the career of their dreams. Through encouragement, our desire is to have our team members unleash their full potential to drive industry leading business results, while making a lasting difference in the lives of others. We embrace diverse viewpoints and perspectives, recognizing that greater inclusion fosters innovation and improves decision-making and financial results. In 2021, the Company published a refreshed set of values that drive our culture. These values include:
 •We act with integrity by doing what we say we are going to do, exhibiting accountability, and building trust at all times.
 •We value inclusion by respecting diverse opinions to collaborate effectively.


•We are committed to customers both internally and externally, with a dedication to excellence in every encounter.
 •We promote ingenuity by proactively attacking challenges, creating innovative solutions, and constantly learning to drive continuous improvement.
 •We genuinely care for each other, our customers, and our communities.
 As mentioned above, we established an ESG/Sustainability Council in 2020 with Board oversight to drive the five tenets of our long-term ESG strategy: Environmental Responsibility, Our People, Our Community, Governance and Our COVID Response. Our commitment to ESG and these tenets is a strategic and operational imperative as we build a sustainable infrastructure across the Company. In partnership with our employees, we are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community through pollution prevention, conservation, responsible use and sustainable practices. Through our sustainability initiatives, we further engage our employees to ensure that our business practices support diversity, equity and inclusion to build an innovative workforce and to strive toward having our organization reflect the diversity of our customers and suppliers.
Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company’s human capital practices and management compensation philosophy, including the incentive compensation and equity-based plans for executives. Our Chief Human Resources Officer reports on important human capital management topics to this committee every quarter, including the Company’s all-important diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
Benchmark’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy is focused on creating a culture of belonging where team members can be their authentic selves and cultivate a workplace where everyone can succeed.
 
Our commitment to DEI starts at the top with the Company’s Board of Directors. In early 2021, the Board’s Nominating, Sustainability and Governance Committee committed to adding more diversity to our Board with the goal of adding continued female representation, as well as a racially and/or ethnically diverse member as we continue to evolve our Board structure. In June 2021, the Company welcomed Lynn Wentworth as our latest female director. In October 2021, Benchmark appointed a new independent director, Ramesh Gopalakrishnan, to fill a vacant board position. Mr. Gopalakrishnan is a native of India and brings diverse perspectives and thought leadership to the Board based on his significant global operational and strategy experience at several multinational companies. We will continue to keep diversity in mind as we refresh our Board in the future.
 
In January 2022, the senior executive team selected 16 Benchmark team members to serve on the Company’s inaugural Inclusion Council. The Inclusion Council, which includes our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Human Resources Officer, meet regularly to discuss the Company’s role in DEI and provide advice to integrate, inform and shape the DEI strategy at Benchmark. Our aim is to ensure that the Company is a place where diverse thinking, experiences and ideas are encouraged, presented and celebrated in order to see the best ideas come to life. To advance these objectives, the Company increased the availability of training on topics such as anti-harassment, anti-discrimination and unconscious bias. The Company is also training our talent acquisition team and hiring managers on how to work to eliminate bias in the interview process. The Company also conducted a global engagement and inclusion survey in the fall of 2021 to elicit feedback from employees, and is developing action plans for continuous improvement in the areas of leadership, communication, culture, inclusion, growth and development. The Human Capital and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors reviews these initiatives and results with our Chief Human Resources Officer quarterly to track progress on our DEI strategy.
 
Career Development
 
Benchmark is committed to developing a qualified and motivated workforce to power our continued innovation and growth. We provide opportunities for employees to gain the skills and knowledge they need to advance in the Company and fulfill their personal career goals.
 
We are on a journey to transform and modernize our talent management practices at Benchmark. In 2020, the Company began implementing a new Human Capital Management (HCM) system to establish a foundation and common database upon which the Company can centralize people-related data and standardize people management processes across the globe. The HCM system provides an operating framework to enable leaders to better hire talent and manage teams, including setting goals, performance evaluations, succession planning, and learning and

development. The HCM system will also provide visibility for the Company to monitor employee retention rates, employee promotions and other data to help ensure that we focus on giving employees opportunities to advance within the Company. The Company also offers competency-based training on leadership and development through our online learning platform.
 
We offer competitive compensation and benefits packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. In the U.S., we offer medical, dental, and vision benefits, disability coverage, survivor benefits, and a wellness program. We also offer competitive retirement benefits including a 401(k) match program at 100% of eligible employee contributions up to 4%, as well as similar retirement financial tools in other countries in which we operate. In addition to base salary, Benchmark employees participate in a Quarterly Incentive Plan or Annual Incentive Plan that supports our organizational philosophy of allowing employees to share in the Company’s performance and success. These plans align employee efforts to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives through cash bonus payouts based primarily on performance results achieved against plan performance measures. Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward performance and align incentives with achievement of the Company’s strategic plan and both short- and long-term operating objectives. In accordance with our compensation philosophy established by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee and the Board, we believe our executive pay is well-aligned with performance, creating a positive relationship between our operational performance and shareholder returns. Benchmark utilizes equity grants as part of at-risk incentive compensation for Named Executive Officers using a combination of performance-based restricted stock units and time-based restricted stock units to align their compensation with the creation of shareholder value.
 
Our Chief Human Resources Officer, and other key leaders in our organization, update the Human Capital and Compensation Committee on our strategy for talent development and retention, including succession planning for key positions in the Company.
 
Health and Safety
 The safety of our employees is also of paramount concern to us. We are committed to ensuring that proper working conditions exist for the safety of our employees, such as the implementation of 6S and visual management practices, developing, implementing and continuously improving our Occupational Health and Safety Management System, and providing appropriate education, reporting and controls. We engage our employees to participate in decision-making as part of our Occupational Health and Safety Management System to ensure that we are developing, implementing and continuously improving our health and safety ecosystem and performance to prevent injury and illness. From the onset of the COVID pandemic, we established a COVID Task Force, a cross-functional advisory team of Company leaders committed to promoting the health and safety of our employees in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines and ensuring that our employees’ safety remains a constant focal point. The COVID Task Force has promulgated policies, procedures, protocols and guidelines relating to symptom awareness and contact tracing, remote work requirements, effective hygiene practices, travel restrictions, temperature screening, visitor protocols, social distancing, facial mask requirements, enhanced cleaning protocols and decontamination procedures.
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 10,900 people, approximately 340 of whom were engaged in design and development engineering. None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union. In certain international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions and by works councils. Some European countries also often have mandatory legal provisions regarding terms of employment, severance compensation and other conditions of employment that are more restrictive than U.S. laws. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we believe that our employee and labor relations are strong.


Segments and International Operations
 We have manufacturing facilities in the Americas (United States and Mexico), Asia (China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand) and Europe (Netherlands and Romania) to serve our customers. Benchmark is operated and managed geographically, and management evaluates performance and allocates resources on a geographic basis. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, 55%, 52% and 47%, respectively, of our sales were from our international operations. See Note 8 and Note 13 to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for segment and geographical information.
Governmental Regulation
 Our operations, and the operations of businesses that we acquire, are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to security clearance, trade compliance, anticorruption, environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable requirements. Significant costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements, which could affect our earnings and competitive position. In addition, our past, current and future operations, and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns.
We periodically generate and temporarily handle limited amounts of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law. We contract for the off-site disposal of these materials and have implemented a waste management program to address related regulatory issues. For additional information, see “Risk Factors—Compliance or the failure to comply with environmental regulations could cause us significant expense” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.
