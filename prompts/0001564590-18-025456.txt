Item 1.  
Business
 Overview
 We are a global leader in specialty memory solutions, serving the electronics industry for over 25 years. We have a leading market position worldwide, as measured by revenue, in specialty memory where we work closely with original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers to develop solutions, which incorporate customer-specific requirements. Our products are designed-in by OEMs in the networking, enterprise storage, telecom, industrial and other such vertical markets. In addition, as part of our global business, we have established a leading market position, as measured by market share, in Brazil as the largest in-country manufacturer of memory for desktops, notebooks and servers, as well as mobile memory for smartphones. As a result of our acquisition of Penguin Computing, Inc., or Penguin Computing, in June 2018 and the creation of a new business unit, SMART Specialty Compute & Storage Solutions, or SCSS, we have expanded our serviceable markets into areas requiring specialized computing platforms in artificial intelligence and machine learning, advanced modeling and high performance computing serving a broad base of enterprise and government customers. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we began a new business in Brazil to focus on battery assembly for smartphones, which we expect will contribute to revenue in fiscal 2019. We believe our customers rely on us as a strategic supplier due to our application-specific products, quality and technical support, our global footprint and, in Brazil, our ability to provide locally manufactured products. We also provide customized, integrated supply chain services to certain OEM customers to assist them in the management and execution of their procurement processes. Our global, diversified customer base includes over 450 end customers such as Cisco Systems, Inc., or Cisco, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, Dell Technologies, or Dell, and LG Electronics, or LG.
 In our specialty memory solutions business, we focus on design and manufacture of application-specific products, technical support and value-added testing services that differ from the core focus of standard memory module providers. We collaborate closely with our global OEM customers throughout their design process and across multiple projects to create solutions for demanding applications with differentiated requirements, such as specific form factors, higher density, lower power, specific firmware or greater durability and reliability compared to standard solutions. We target opportunities where we believe we can be a primary supplier of longer-lifecycle solutions to OEM customers for diverse and growing end markets within the networking, communications, storage, industrial, medical and automotive industries. In this business, we offer an extensive portfolio of over 2,000 products, which includes all generations of DRAM, as well as embedded and removable Flash, enterprise memory and hybrid volatile and non-volatile memory solutions. We also offer customized, integrated supply chain services to enable our customers to manage supply chain planning and execution, which reduces costs and increases productivity. Our supply chain services are based on our proprietary software platform that we developed and integrated with our customers’ respective procurement management systems as well as our suppliers’ distribution management systems.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Penguin Computing and created SCSS which has expanded our serviceable markets into areas requiring specialized computing platforms in artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning, advanced modeling and high performance computing. Through SCSS, we design, manufacture and sell specialty compute and storage systems to a broad base of enterprise and government customers and government contractors. SCSS also offers a broad portfolio of hardware and software products including solutions based on the Open Compute Project, or OCP. Our products include Linux-based servers, software, integrated turn-key clusters, enterprise-grade storage, and bare metal high performance computing, or HPC, all available in hardware or cloud-based solutions via Penguin Computing® On-Demand™ (POD™). 
 We believe our close collaboration with customers, customer-specific designs, long-lifecycle solutions and proprietary supply chain services create significant customer attachment, allows us the ability to identify new opportunities for growth and provide us with a high level of relative visibility and stability through macroeconomic cycles. Furthermore, we believe our business has relatively low capital expenditure requirements, and we have been able to leverage a flexible cost structure to maintain generally stable margins throughout market cycles. 
 Since 2002, when we commenced our operations in Brazil, we have invested over $210 million to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities and have assembled and trained a staff of over 620 employees, who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country. In Brazil, we process 
 4


imported wafers and cut, package and test them to create memory components used to manufacture modules and other memory and Flash-based products. We have a strategic, long-term relationship with a global memory wafer supplier that has provided us with a stable source of competitively priced wafers for the Brazilian market and provides our supplier with access to that market through our in-country infrastructure and capabilities.
 Our business in Brazil was initially focused on Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, components and modules for desktops, notebooks and servers, where local content and tax regulations provide substantial financial incentives to our customers to procure locally manufactured memory products, particularly when they are made with locally processed components. We have leveraged our experience and success in these markets to expand into mobile memory, primarily for smartphones, which include embedded multimedia controllers, or eMMC, and embedded multi-chip package, or eMCP products, where additional local content requirements and tax incentives have been introduced. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, these mobile memory products accounted for 68%, 67% and 65%, respectively, of our net sales in Brazil. Based on industry reports of expected unit sales for mobile phones in Brazil, taking into account our average selling price of approximately $28.17 per eMCP for mobile memory during the full fiscal year 2018, we believe that the total addressable market for locally produced mobile memory for mobile phones in Brazil will reach approximately $765 million by 2020. We have also demonstrated our ability to service the smartphone market in Brazil as we are now qualified at seven of the top ten mobile vendors in Brazil representing, according to industry data, over 94% of the mobile phones sold in Brazil in calendar 2017.
 The Brazilian government has a long history of utilizing local content requirements to promote job creation, sustain economic growth and increase the competitiveness of various domestic industries. Local content requirements have been important in the development of numerous industries in Brazil, including automotive, oil and gas, aerospace, healthcare and IT. Beginning in 1991, local content regulation was introduced to vitalize Brazil’s IT industry. Specifically, requirements for locally manufactured memory have been in place for over 20years and have increased significantly over time as manufacturing capacity has increased. For example, in notebooks, the requirement for locally manufactured DRAM integrated circuits, or ICs, has increased from 30% in 2010 to 80% in 2018, which means that 80% of the DRAM modules purchased by an OEM in 2018 for use in notebooks for the Brazil market must contain ICs locally manufactured in order for the OEM to qualify for certain tax benefits.  As a result of the proliferation of mobile devices, the requirements for locally manufactured embedded memory for smartphones were introduced in March 2014, which has initially increased from 5% in calendar 2014 to 30% in calendar 2017, 50% for calendar 2018 and is scheduled to increase to 60% for calendar 2019. With the local content requirements for various IT products increasing, we believe that our local manufacturing capabilities provide a valuable and differentiated offering to our OEM customers in Brazil. We also believe that our long-term relationships with many of these customers as the largest supplier of locally manufactured memory products provides us with stability and visibility for our Brazilian business, as well as significant growth prospects.
 We sell our solutions directly to a diversified base of global customers; both OEM’s and end users. Our top ten end customers, five of which have been our end customers for over a decade, accounted for 84% and 84% of our net sales in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our global sales channel consists of a direct sales force supported by a broad network of independent sales representatives located throughout North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Our integrated sales process incorporates our direct sales force and customer service representatives and a high level of involvement from our senior executives. Our on-site field application engineers, or FAEs, collaborate with our customers and provide us with insight into their product roadmaps, allowing us to identify opportunities to grow our business. The combination of our integrated sales network with our FAEs allows us to be more responsive to each customer’s unique requirements, enabling us to navigate the complex qualification processes at leading global OEM and end users. We believe our strong and often longstanding relationships with our customers reinforce our competitive position.
 Our Industry
 We believe that significant opportunities exist across the major markets in which our business operates due to the increasing global demand for existing and next generation memory technologies, continued growth and demand for compute and storage systems serving AI and other technical computing markets, and OEM and end user requirements for high quality and reliability backed by premium service and support. We believe that a number of trends are driving the expansion of our market opportunity:
 5


Memory continues to be critical to system performance. With the growth in mobility, cloud computing and data intensive applications, the importance of and demand for memory continues to increase. Based on industry data, we believe that worldwide demand for DRAM and NAND Flash memory units will increase by 184% and 80%, respectively, when comparing 2022 to 2017. The increasing diversity of demanding applications requires memory solutions tailored to meet these varying and growing needs. Memory density also continues to increase. Higher memory densities, lower power requirements and increasingly smaller form factors are especially important in mobile and embedded devices, where high performance and lower power consumption are critical.
 Stabilization of DRAM market. Industry consolidation, increased capital expenditure requirements, continued technology advancements and the shift in new production from DRAM to NAND have stabilized global DRAM supply and pricing in recent years. Further improvement in availability of DRAM and a greater variety of DRAM technologies present an improved opportunity for our specialty memory solutions.
 Flash memory market continues to grow. The markets for Flash memory-based solutions continue to grow driven by a variety of applications. High capacity applications such as for datacenter servers are increasing demand for very high density 3D NAND components.  Meanwhile many applications such as networking, storage and industrial applications continue to grow but require lower density solutions with application-driven requirements such as long endurance, ruggedness, wider temperature ranges and different form factors.
 Increasing memory demand for smartphones in Brazil. Consumer demand for smartphones in Brazil is expected to grow, supported by the growing middle class, improvement in cellular and wireless infrastructure and current low levels of penetration of mobile devices. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the Brazilian middle class is expected to expand from 41% of the population, or 76 million people, in 2005, to 58% of the population, or 127 million people, by 2025. As a result, smartphone penetration is expected to increase. Based on industry reports, we expect sales of mobile phones in Brazil to grow to 52.1 million units in 2020, with smartphone sales expected to account for 51.0 million units in 2020 (a 14.7% increase over 2016). We expect this increase in smartphone penetration to drive a corresponding increase in the demand for mobile memory components and modules.
 Increasing local content requirements in Brazil and other incentives. Local content requirements have been central to the Brazilian regulatory environment since the 1960s. These regulations are aimed at promoting job creation, sustaining economic growth and increasing the competitiveness of various domestic industries, and have helped enable a significant expansion of the Brazilian middle class. Local content requirements have been instrumental in the development of numerous key industries in Brazil, including automotive, oil and gas, aerospace, healthcare and IT. Once implemented, Brazil’s local content requirements have been generally maintained or increased over time.
 In the IT industry, government programs have been introduced to incentivize manufacturers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil and to incentivize OEMs to purchase locally manufactured components for their products.
 Lei da Informática—Processo Produtivo Básico (PPB/IT Program), 1991: Provides for significant tax benefits for companies that develop or produce computing and automation goods locally and invest in IT-related research and development in Brazil. The PPB/IT Program requirements for local content are published publicly on a periodic basis and typically include the requirements for the three to four-year period following publication. The PPB/IT Program requirements for locally sourced memory components from calendar years 2008 to 2019 are set forth below.

 OEMs that are PPB/IT Program-compliant and who fulfill the above local content requirements receive substantial benefits, including a reduction in excise taxes on their purchases from qualified suppliers as well as a reduction in taxes that they are required to charge on sales to their end customers. We estimate that the aggregate of the PPB/IT Program-related benefits is around 28% of the resale value of the OEM’s end products. These tax benefits provide a strong incentive for OEMs to purchase products from local content manufacturers such as us. 
 Other tax incentives introduced to incentivize manufacturers to establish and expand their operations in Brazil, include the following:
  
• | Lei do Bem, 2005: Fosters technology innovation in Brazil by providing a reduction in corporate income tax through allowance of expenses related to research and development activities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support Program for the Technological Development of the Semiconductor and Display Industries (PADIS), 2007, extended in 2016: Awards incentives and provides significant tax relief, including reductions in the Brazilian aggregate statutory income tax rates, to semiconductor and display companies that invest in research and development and that promote the development, design, test and packaging processes in Brazil. Furthermore, combining PADIS and PPB/IT Program-compliance provides additional financial incentives to OEMs that purchase products containing memory components that are locally processed from wafers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2013, the European Union, or EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the World Trade Organization, or WTO, to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. On August 30, 2017, the WTO panel released a report in which the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. The parties all appealed the report’s findings and hearings on the appeals were held in June 2018. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent to continue to dispute the panel’s report and, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles in order to continue to support local industry. There can be no assurance, however, that, if needed, the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. While we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or the impact of the WTO’s report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Rapid growth in AI and HPC. SCSS is a leading provider of HPC, AI, and enterprise data center and cloud solutions. According to an August 2018 Hyperion Research presentation, the Global HPC market is expected to grow to $38.4 billion in 2022. We believe that SCSS will be able to service a substantial portion of these potential markets. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our core competitive strengths include:
 Business model focused on specialized markets and strong customer collaboration. The complexity of applications today requires sophisticated solutions with a high degree of specialization and customization to fulfill the requirements of OEMs. These products are designed-in by OEMs in the networking, enterprise storage, telecom, industrial and other such vertical markets. We focus on opportunities in markets that feature products with longer life cycles (typically five to seven years), specialized form factors and customized firmware, which typically require intensive and time-consuming qualification processes and create high switching costs for our customers. Our research and development teams are closely aligned with our customers, and this collaboration enables early stage adoption of our solutions and significant visibility into our customers’ product roadmaps. Our global supply chain services also foster further customer attachment. Our high level of collaboration and integration with our customers make it difficult, costly and time consuming for them to switch to an alternative supplier.
 Strong presence in Brazil. We are the largest local manufacturer of DRAM components and DRAM modules for the desktop, notebook and server markets in Brazil as measured by market share. We are also the first company to develop manufacturing capabilities for Flash-based products in Brazil, where we are the leading manufacturer of mobile memory products, such as mobile DRAM, eMMC and eMCP. We benefit from having a first mover advantage in Brazil (having invested over $210 million in the country since 2002 to build and improve our advanced manufacturing facilities) and understanding government initiatives and how to navigate regulatory requirements to benefit our company and our customers. We believe we are well positioned to maintain our established leadership in Brazil’s memory market and to extend our leadership in the growing mobile memory market.
 Our experience in Brazil has helped us develop expertise in semiconductor technology and advanced manufacturing that allows us to be a trusted local supplier to OEMs. We have demonstrated our ability to produce solutions with shrinking geometries and increasing complexity. In addition, we benefit from a strategic wafer supply relationship that has provided us with a strong, continuous supply of competitively priced wafers for use in the local market. Through this relationship, our collaboration on technology and processes with key suppliers and our continued capital investment, we strive to maintain our advanced manufacturing capabilities and operate at a high level of efficiency with capabilities and scale that are difficult for a competitor to replicate. We are leveraging on our deep experience in the Brazil market to build a battery assembly business to expand our penetration into the smartphone market in the country. We have also made significant investments in assembling and training a staff of over 620 employees who comprise many of the leading semiconductor technology professionals in the country.
 Well positioned to benefit from Brazilian local content regulations. Increasing local content requirements for local manufacturing help drive our growth strategy in Brazil. While qualified suppliers are allowed to import a relatively small portion of this requirement with minimal local processing, we are one of the few companies currently qualified that can package and test these products locally and the largest in terms of production volume. Global suppliers of memory components and modules not manufactured in Brazil cannot address the local content purchasing requirements of OEM customers selling products in Brazil. Because of our infrastructure, scale and capabilities in Brazil, we have a significant advantage in being able to satisfy these local content requirements.
 Global footprint and delivery network. We are located near many of our largest customers and their manufacturing partners around the world, offering extensive global manufacturing, engineering and supply chain management capabilities. We have four manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Brazil and Malaysia; eight facilities with engineering and research and development operations located in five countries; and employees located in nine countries across the world. Our established global network of component sources helps to ensure that our pricing remains competitive and that we are able to provide a stable source of supply for our customers.
 Advanced manufacturing capabilities. We have invested in facilities and processes tailored to meet the exacting demands and specialized requirements of our OEM customers while maintaining a high level of efficiency, quality and productivity. Our advanced processes enable us to provide quick turnaround to meet our customer demands. Our extensive quality control programs and sophisticated test capabilities help to ensure a low defect rate 
 8


and, for markets that require it, we offer reliability testing and screening substantially above standard industry practices. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities and processes are International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 9001:2008, 14001:2004 and Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, or OHSAS, 18001:2007 compliant, and our manufacturing facilities have been audited for compliance with the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance, or RBA (formerly known as the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition, or EICC), which is increasingly a requirement of major global OEMs.
 Flexible operating model. We believe our operating model has enabled us to maintain margins that are more stable than those of many of the largest memory manufacturers, as such memory manufacturers own their own wafer fabs which are extremely costly to build. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities are focused on packaging and test of ICs after they are produced in wafer form at a wafer fab. As we do not own or operate our own wafer fabs, we have low capital expenditures relative to semiconductor manufacturers. Our business also is characterized by low fixed costs. Both factors have helped us maintain generally stable margins through market cycles.
 Ability to manage complex supply chains at scale. Our need to manage complex supply chains helped us develop our proprietary software platform, utilized by a team of dedicated professionals to meet the specific needs of our customers. We integrate our proprietary software platform with our customers’ procurement management as well as our suppliers’ distribution management systems to enable supply chain planning and execution, which lowers costs and increases efficiency. We believe this ability to manage complex supply chains at scale helps our customers minimize inventory levels while ensuring timely supply of material.
 Advanced open technologies for AI and HPC. Our SCSS products and services focus on the benefits that come from bringing open hardware and software solutions to our customers. This approach provides freedom of choice by eliminating vendor lock-in, enables customers to take advantage of leading edge technologies early in cycle and increases the customers’ overall return on investment. Our OCP enables flexibility and quick adoption allowing us to meet the specialized needs of key customers in demanding verticals such as social media, oil and gas, financial services, media and entertainment, universities and government agencies. 
 Proven management team with history of execution. We have an experienced and long-serving senior management team with an average tenure of approximately 18 years. The management team has a successful track record of operating the business through many market cycles and industry changes. Our senior management team has deep relationships throughout the sector and extensive knowledge of the global memory, storage and compute markets as well as the Brazilian IT industry and regulatory environment.
 Our Strategy
 Our goals are to further strengthen our leadership position in the design, manufacture and supply of specialty solutions for leading OEMs, to diversify and broaden our reach and capabilities into new technologies, markets and channels through SCSS that leverage our proven platform of integrating and growing businesses, and to pursue other opportunities for growth in existing and new markets. We are pursuing the following strategies to achieve our goals: 
 Grow our leadership in specialty memory. We intend to grow our position among specialty memory suppliers. We will continue to focus on delivering innovative solutions to help our customers improve functionality, enhance their supply chain, reduce costs and accelerate their time-to-market. To ensure we can meet the demands of our existing customers, we will continue to invest in research and development, our facilities and our workforce, especially as our new product offerings in DDR4 and embedded Flash memory continue to ramp. In addition, we are increasing our focus on tier 2 and tier 3 customers.
 Expand our total addressable market by offering innovative new memory, compute and storage solutions and by capitalizing on new market opportunities. We intend to leverage our experience and capabilities to launch new products and expand into new markets. We believe this will allow us to further penetrate our existing customers as well as increase the number of customers that we serve. Our strategy is based on providing specialized products that require levels of service and support that larger semiconductor manufacturers often do not provide. As part of this strategy, we introduced eMMC products for networking, communications, industrial and medical markets, where we expect strong growth for eMMC solutions. We believe that our long-term customer and supplier relationships provide a key advantage in gaining entry into new markets. In addition, we added memory solutions for SmartTVs to our product offerings in Brazil. We plan to continue investing in innovation in strategic areas, such as Flash and solid-state storage, persistent memory and the evolving artificial intelligence market.

Diversify and expand our products, capabilities and markets through acquisition and organic growth. We will further diversify our business through acquisitions like Penguin Computing and the creation of SCSS, which enable us to accelerate and broaden our reach and capabilities into new technologies, markets and channels that leverage our proven platform of integrating and growing businesses. We intend to further expand our products, capabilities and markets with future acquisitions that strategically, financially and culturally match our goals. Additionally, we will further diversify our business by investing in new products such as our expansion into the battery assembly business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
 Capture growing mobile memory market in Brazil. We expect to continue to leverage our experience and success in our desktop, notebook and server DRAM business to capitalize upon high-growth markets for mobile memory. We will seek to continue to grow our market share with OEMs that are currently utilizing imported mobile memory components to manufacture smartphones in Brazil, as local content requirements for mobile memory components, such as eMMC, eMCP and mobile DRAM. In December 2013 and again in December 2014, one of our subsidiaries in Brazil obtained financing from BNDES to purchase capital equipment and invest in further expansion of our operations in Brazil. We utilized much of the proceeds from the BNDES Agreements to purchase capital equipment and expand our manufacturing capabilities to capture growth opportunities in the mobile memory market. We believe our investments in infrastructure, customer relationships and broad set of solutions position us to capitalize on growing mobile memory demand and increasing local content requirements.
 Expand our global coverage. Devices and applications using memory are required in every region of the world, requiring OEMs to maintain a global supply chain to meet that demand. In addition to the United States and Brazil, we plan to increase our presence internationally and target new OEM customers as well as new end user customers in Europe and Asia.

Manufacturing and Test
 Manufacturing
 We have manufacturing facilities in Atibaia, Brazil; Newark and Fremont, California; and Penang, Malaysia. Our manufacturing facilities have been ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 certified. Additionally, we are a member of the RBA (formerly known as the EICC), and our manufacturing facilities are compliant with the RBA Code of Conduct, which is increasingly a business requirement of global OEM customers. We believe that our manufacturing operations have benefited from our many years of design experience and our existing library of proven designs which stress high manufacturability and quality. Over 30 years of manufacturing experience enables us to quickly move from manufacturing initiation to full production volumes of new products, which is paramount in helping our customers, achieve rapid time-to-market for their new product introductions. As a result of our design efficiencies, high level of automation and expertise in utilizing advanced manufacturing processes, we achieve high manufacturing yields and reduced direct labor costs and offer our customers quick turnaround of both small and large production orders, which is a key factor in enabling our build-to-order model.
 While we do not own or operate wafer fabs, we have capabilities for subsequent stages of the product manufacturing cycle. Our manufacturing capabilities in Brazil consist of receiving unmounted ICs in wafer form from third-party wafer fabs, preparing and packaging the ICs into semiconductor components, testing the components, and in some cases placing these components on substrates or printed circuit boards to make modules or multi-chip packages. Our advanced manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to become the largest local manufacturer of DRAM components and DRAM modules for the desktop, notebook and server markets in Brazil, as measured by market share. In recent years, we have expanded our manufacturing capabilities to enable us to manufacture mobile DRAM components and products as well as to process Flash wafers to manufacture NAND components. We also manufacture various Flash-based products, including eMCP and eMMC products. Through our investments and experience in Brazil, we have developed expertise in semiconductor technology and advanced manufacturing that allows us to manufacture products with shrinking geometries and increasing complexity. We continue to make significant capital investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities and operate at a high level of efficiency.
 Product testing is an important aspect of our manufacturing operations and we believe that we have established substantial technical expertise in the testing of products for high-end applications. Our extensive testing capabilities not only help to ensure a low defect rate, but they also enable us, in certain situations, to sell specialized testing as an additional service. We test our products for full functionality and, we design customer specific testing processes that differ from the core focus of standard providers. We have achieved stringent quality targets across a broad spectrum of system applications and customer-specific designs. Our staff includes experienced test engineers who have developed proprietary testing routines and parameters which, combined with our advanced test equipment, enable us to diagnose problems in components as well as in system design, and enable us to characterize the performance of new products and to provide high quality products in volume.
 We employ extensive software-based electrical and thermal simulations in the design of DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4 modules and test those designs on high-end functional testers utilizing a broad set of test suites. These tests are designed to meet the quality requirements of enterprise class systems pursuant to stringent specifications required by various high speed applications. We also conduct design verification testing of hardware and firmware as well as system integration and reliability testing. We work to continually improve our test routines and associated software and have recently developed a high-volume, fully automated reliability testing and screening capability substantially beyond standard industry practices that enables us to reduce the occurrence of early life failures and weak module fallout which can save our customers from the often significant expenses associated with replacing products that fail after their field deployment.
 Customers
 Our principal end customers include global OEMs as well as end customers that compete in the computing, networking, communications, storage, aerospace, defense, mobile, social media and entertainment along with the Federal Government and industrial markets. 
 13


Overall, we served more than 450 end customers in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales to our ten largest end customers (including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of such end customers) accounted for 84%, 84% and 81% of net sales, respectively. Of our end customers, Samsung accounted for 34%, 19% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; Cisco accounted for 12%, 15% and 19% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; Lenovo accounted for 11%, 11% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; and Dell accounted for 10% of net sales in fiscal 2018. Direct sales to Samsung accounted for 34%, 19% and 13% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; direct sales to Flex accounted for 13%, 14% and 17% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; and direct sales to Hon Hai accounted for 13% and 11% of net sales in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. During these periods, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. Our longstanding relationship with Cisco, spanning over 20 years, exists within multiple business units and engineering organizations within Cisco. Our products are manufactured on a build-to-order basis. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to customer purchase orders and are not based on long-term supply agreements. Most of our business is on a purchase order basis; accordingly, we have limited backlog and we do not believe our backlog is material or indicative of anticipated net sales.
 Suppliers
 To address the needs of our customers, we have developed and maintained relationships with leading semiconductor suppliers located in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Our semiconductor suppliers include many of the world’s largest memory manufacturers including Samsung, Micron Technology, Inc., or Micron, SK Hynix, Inc., or SK Hynix, and Toshiba Corporation, or Toshiba. They also include some of the world’s largest providers of computing and graphics processers including AMD, Intel and Nvidia. We frequently work jointly with our suppliers in bidding for customers’ design-in opportunities. We also work closely with our suppliers to better ensure that materials are available and delivered on time. Our established global network of component sources helps to ensure that our pricing remains competitive and that we are able to provide a stable source of supply for our customers.
 We believe that our longstanding relationships with leading suppliers put us in a favorable position to procure sufficient quantities of materials, including during periods of industry shortages. Our flexible and responsive global manufacturing capabilities, inventory management systems and global IT system allow us to cost-effectively move materials from one site to another and often deploy what might otherwise be excess inventory among other products and customers. We purchase almost all of our materials, including wafers used in our memory products in Brazil, from our suppliers on a purchase order basis and generally do not have long-term commitments from suppliers.
 Sales, Support and Marketing
 We primarily sell our products directly to global OEMs and end customers located across North America, Latin America, Asia and Europe. Our sales and marketing efforts are conducted through an integrated process incorporating our direct sales force, customer service representatives and our FAEs with a network of independent sales representatives. Our sales and marketing efforts also include a high level of involvement from our senior executives. Larger customers are also often supported by dedicated sales and support teams. As of August 31, 2018, we had 110 sales and marketing personnel worldwide. 
 Our on-site FAEs work closely with our sales team to provide product design support to our customers. Our FAEs collaborate closely with our customers, providing us with insight into their product roadmaps and allowing us to identify opportunities at an early stage to help grow our business. The combination of our integrated sales network with our FAEs enables us to be more responsive and successful in navigating through each customer’s unique and oftentimes complex design qualification process. 
 Our marketing activities include advertising in technical journals, publishing articles in leading industry periodicals and utilizing direct email solicitation. In addition to these marketing activities, we also participate in many industry trade shows worldwide. We have active memberships in industry organizations such as the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council, or JEDEC, the USB Implementers Forum, the SD Card Association, the Storage Networking Industry Association, the CompactFlash Association, and Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group, or PCI-SIG.

Research and Development
 The timely development of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our research and development activities are conducted primarily at our research and development centers in Newark, Fremont and Irvine, California; Atibaia, Brazil; Penang, Malaysia; Gilbert, Arizona; Seongnam-City, South Korea; New Taipei City, Taiwan; and Tewksbury, Massachusetts.  Our research and development activities are focused on driving innovation in our products as well as continuous process improvement for our procurement and manufacturing. Our product development includes innovations for next generation DRAM products, mobile DRAM, hybrid memories such as hybrid volatile and non-volatile DRAM or NVDIMM, enterprise memory, and many Flash-based products, such as eMMC and eMCP. We plan to continue to devote research and development efforts to the innovation and design of these and other new products which address the requirements of our customers, especially for growing markets for DRAM and Flash mobile memory products, such as mobile and automotive.
 We are developing a broad offering of Flash-based products targeting the automotive, industrial, medical, communications, mobile and networking markets. In order to enhance our efforts to develop innovative Flash products, we have increased our engineering resources significantly, including in our research and development center in New Taipei City, where our engineering team is dedicated to firmware development, systems engineering and integration, system and platform validation and applications, and product and reliability engineering for new Flash memory products, including our eMMC product. In addition, in order to take advantage of local regulations and government incentive programs for the growing mobile memory market in Brazil, we have invested substantial financial and management resources to expand our Brazilian research and development capabilities to enable us to develop a broad offering of Flash-based products for the local market 
 Our advanced engineering and design capabilities allow us to address our customers’ increasingly complex needs. We design our products to be compatible with existing industry standards and, where appropriate, develop and promote new standards or provide custom solutions to meet customers’ requirements. An important aspect of our research and development effort is understanding the challenges presented by our customers’ requirements and addressing them by utilizing our industry knowledge, proprietary technologies and technical expertise. By working closely with our customers and suppliers, we are able to deliver technically advanced products designed to meet customer-specific needs with competitive solutions to satisfy our customers’ memory, storage and compute requirements, shorten their time-to-market and enhance the performance of our customers’ end products and applications.
 We spent $39.8 million, $38.2 million and $38.1 million on research and development in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of August 31, 2018, we had 162 research and development personnel worldwide.
 Competition
 We primarily compete against global and local memory module providers, and to a lesser extent, large semiconductor memory IC manufacturers that utilize a portion of their capacity to manufacture memory modules. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the ability to meet customer-specific requirements and provide high product quality, strong technical support, technologically advanced products and services, advanced testing capabilities, flexible and global delivery options, reliable supply and reasonable pricing. Our principal competitors include:

• | Providers of specialty memory products, including Viking Technology (a division of Sanmina Corporation), or Viking Technology, ATP Electronics, Inc., or ATP, Unigen Corporation, or Unigen, Apacer Technology, Inc., or Apacer, and Transcend Information, Inc., or Transcend;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In Brazil, local manufacturers of DRAM modules and Flash products and local manufacturers of memory ICs, including HT Micron Semicondutores Ltda., or HT Micron
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Semiconductor memory IC manufacturers that also manufacture DRAM modules and Flash products, including Samsung, Micron, Western Digital Corporation, or Western Digital, SK Hynix, and Toshiba;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our supply chain services business, a broad set of companies, including distributors and third party logistics providers as well as our customers’ in-house solutions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of compute and storage systems, including HPE, Dell, Cray Computer Corporation, or Cray.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


Some of our global competitors are large international companies that have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as greater name recognition and longer-standing relationships with customers and suppliers than we do. In contrast with our focus on specialty memory products with high levels of service and support, these competitors are generally focused on high-volume memory and storage products that are manufactured to industry standard specifications, and they have limited customization and service capabilities.
 In addition, some of our competitors are also our suppliers or customers. See “Item A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Sales to a limited number of customers represents a significant portion of our net sales, and the loss of any key customer or key program, or the demands of our key customers, could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition” and “—Our dependence on a small number of sole or limited source suppliers subjects us to certain risks, including the risk that we may be unable to obtain adequate supplies at a reasonable price and in a timely manner.”
 In Brazil, our competitors are generally much smaller in scale than we are in terms of revenue and capabilities for manufacturing and for research and development. To a lesser degree, we compete with companies that import DRAM and Flash components and products. We believe that import duties and local content requirements in Brazil give us an advantage over these companies. As the local market grows, competition may increase in Brazil.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright and, to a lesser extent, patents to protect our intellectual property rights. As of September 28, 2018, we have 33 issued patents, including 31 patents issued in the United States, one patent issued in Brazil and one patent issued in South Korea, expiring between 2022 and 2037, excluding any additional patent term for patent term adjustments. In addition, we have 29 patent applications pending, including 14 patent applications in the United States, 7 patent applications in Brazil, 6 patent applications in Malaysia, 1 patent application in South Korea, and 1 patent application in Argentina. We also own a number of trademark registrations, including registrations in the United States for the word marks MHUB, SMART MODULAR TECHNOLOGIES and PENGUIN COMPUTING, and trademarks for our stylized “S” logo in combination with the word SMART and in combination with the words SMART MODULAR TECHNOLOGIES;  a trademark in the US and Canada for the graphic logo containing the words PENGUIN COMPUTING; in Brazil, registrations for our stylized “S” logo in combination with the words SMART Modular Technologies; and in Canada, a registration for the word mark PENGUIN COMPUTING.  
 While many of our products contain proprietary aspects, the majority of our products are built to meet industry standards, such as those set by JEDEC, the standards-setting organization for the semiconductor industry. The absence of patent protection for most of our products means that we cannot prevent our competitors from reverse-engineering and duplicating those products. Much of our intellectual property is know-how and trade secrets, and often we rely on the technological skills and innovation of our personnel rather than on patent protection. We believe that our continued success depends largely on our customer relationships, manufacturing and support capabilities and the technical expertise we have developed in manufacturing and designing products, and we rely on trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements to protect this aspect of our business.
 Employees
 As of August 31, 2018, we had 1,538 full-time employees.
 Our employee relations in Brazil are subject to Brazilian labor laws and regulations as well as collective bargaining arrangements that are negotiated every year. Four of these collective bargaining agreements are specific to our company while there are other collective bargaining agreements that are generally applicable to certain segments of the electronics industry. The applicable labor laws and regulations, as well as the collective bargaining agreements, principally relate to matters such as formal working time compensation, paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and payments for overtime, profit sharing and severance. Although a very small number of our employees in Brazil are members of a labor union, all employees in Brazil are represented by the unions for labor and employment matters.
 We have never experienced a work stoppage in any of our locations worldwide, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

Brazilian Local Content Requirements and Other Regulatory Issues
 Brazilian Local Content Requirements
 We expect to continue to invest in maintaining our leadership position, as measured by market share, in both our core Brazilian desktop, notebook and server DRAM businesses and our mobile DRAM and Flash memory products business. We further expect that local content requirements as well as other government incentive programs in Brazil will help drive our growth strategies, as significant incentives exist to promote the development of the local IT industry. In Brazil, we participate in three government investment incentive programs.

• | PPB/IT Program, 1991: Provides for significant relief from various tax provisions for companies that develop or produce computing and automation goods and invest in IT-related research and development in Brazil. OEMs that are PPB/IT Program-compliant and who fulfill the local content requirements receive substantial benefits including a reduction in excise taxes on their purchases from qualified suppliers as well as a reduction in the taxes that they are required to charge on sales to their end customers. We estimate that the aggregate of the PPB/IT Program-related tax benefits can range from 15% to as high as 36% of the resale value of the OEMs’ end products. These tax benefits are a strong incentive for OEMs to purchase products from local content manufacturers such as SMART Brazil, our Brazilian operating subsidiary.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lei do Bem, 2005: Fosters technology innovation in Brazil by providing a reduction in corporate income tax through the allowance of deductions for expenses related to research and development activities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PADIS, 2007, extended in 2016: Awards incentives and significant tax relief, including reductions in the Brazilian aggregate statutory income tax rates, to semiconductor and display companies that invest in research and development and that promote the development, design, test and packaging processes in Brazil. Furthermore, combining PADIS with PPB/IT Program-compliance provides additional financial incentives to OEMs that purchase modules that contain components that are locally processed from wafers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the leading local manufacturer of desktop, notebook and server DRAM modules and DRAM components as well as DRAM and Flash mobile memory products in Brazil, as measured by market share, we benefit substantially from these incentives and local content requirements. A cancellation, reduction or other adverse change in any of these incentives or local content requirements, or our failure to meet these requirements, could have a substantial negative impact on our tax rates and could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil.
 In 2013, the EU, later joined by Japan, requested the establishment of a panel within the WTO to determine whether certain measures enacted by the Brazilian government concerning tax incentives and local content requirements for the automotive and several other industries including the IT industry and including PADIS, the PPB/IT Program and Lei do Bem, are inconsistent with WTO rules. On August 30, 2017 the WTO panel released a report in which the panel concluded, among other things, that the tax exemptions, reductions and suspensions granted for the automotive, IT and other industries amount to subsidies that are inconsistent with the principles of the various WTO agreements, and the panel recommended that Brazil withdraw these subsidies. The parties all appealed the report’s findings and hearings on the appeals were held in June 2018. Government officials in Brazil have expressed their intent to continue to dispute the panel’s report and, if necessary, to restructure the incentives to be consistent with the WTO principles in order to continue to support local industry. There can be no assurance, however, that, if needed, the programs will ultimately be restructured and implemented or, if implemented, whether the restructured programs will provide the same level of support as is currently in place. While we cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or the impact of the WTO’s report, this recommendation could result in significant adverse changes to the local content rules and incentives available to us and our customers in Brazil. Any suspension, early termination or other adverse change in the local content requirements could significantly reduce the demand for, and the profit margins on, our products in Brazil, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 17


Environmental Regulations
 Our operations and properties are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and wastes, reverse logistics (take-back policy) and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. The presence of lead in quantities not believed to be significant have been found in the ground under one of the multi-tenant buildings we lease in Brazil. While we did not cause the contamination, we may be held responsible if remediation is required, although we may be entitled to seek indemnification from responsible parties under Brazilian law and from our lessor under our lease. We cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory agencies, enactment of more stringent laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and cause additional material liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
