Global Truck and Bus Industry
Commercial Vehicle Market Overview. Commercial vehicles are used in a wide variety of end markets, including local and long-haul commercial trucking, bus, construction, mining, agricultural, military, industrial, municipal, off-road recreation and specialty vehicle markets. The commercial vehicle supply industry can generally be separated into two categories: (1) sales to OEMs, in which products are sold in relatively large quantities directly for use by OEMs in new commercial and construction vehicles; and (2) aftermarket sales, in which products are sold as replacements to a wide range of original equipment service organizations, wholesalers, retailers and installers. In the OEM market, suppliers are generally divided into tiers - “Tier 1” suppliers 
3

that provide products directly to OEMs, and “Tier 2” and “Tier 3” suppliers that sell products principally to other suppliers for integration into those suppliers’ own product offerings. We are generally a Tier I supplier.
Our largest end market, the North American commercial truck industry, is supplied by medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle suppliers, as well as automotive suppliers. The commercial vehicle supplier industry is fragmented and comprised of several large companies and many smaller companies. In addition, the commercial vehicle supplier industry is characterized by relatively low production volumes and can have considerable barriers to entry, including the following: (1) specific technical and manufacturing requirements, (2) high transition costs to shift production to new suppliers, (3) just-in-time delivery requirements and (4) strong brand name recognition. Foreign competition is growing with the globalization of the world economy.
Although OEM demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production, suppliers like us can grow by increasing sales through the cross selling and bundling of products, further penetrating existing customers’ businesses, gaining new customers, expanding into new geographic markets, developing new content in our products to meet changing customer needs and by increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that companies with a global presence, advanced technology, engineering and manufacturing and support capabilities, such as our company, are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
North American Commercial Truck Market. Purchasers of commercial trucks include fleet operators, owner operators, governmental agencies and industrial end users. Commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking are generally classified by gross vehicle weight. Class 8 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 lbs. and Classes 5 through 7 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight from 16,001 lbs. to 33,000 lbs. The following table shows production levels (in thousands of units) of commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking from 2013 through 2017 in North America:

 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017
Class 8 trucks | 246 | 297 | 323 | 228 | 256 
Class 5-7 trucks | 201 | 226 | 237 | 233 | 249 

Source: ACT N.A. (February 2018).
The following describes the major markets within the commercial vehicle market in which the GTB Segment competes:
Class 8 Truck Market. The global Class 8 ("Class 8" or "heavy-duty") truck manufacturing market is concentrated in three primary regions: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The global Class 8 truck market is localized in nature due to the following factors: (1) the prohibitive costs of shipping components from one region to another, (2) the high degree of customization to meet the region-specific demands of end-users, and (3) the ability to meet just-in-time delivery requirements. According to ACT Research, four companies represented approximately 98% of North American Class 8 truck production in 2017. The percentages of Class 8 production represented by Daimler, PACCAR, A.B. Volvo, and Navistar were approximately 41%, 30%, 15%, and 12%, respectively, in 2017. We supply products to all of these OEMs.
New Class 8 truck demand has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to economic factors that generate a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles.
The following table illustrates North American Class 8 truck build for the years 2015 to 2022:
“E” — Estimated
Source: ACT (February 2018). 
Class 5-7 Truck Market. North American Class 5-7 ("Class 5-7" or "medium-duty") includes recreational vehicles, buses and medium-duty trucks. We primarily participate in the Class 6 and 7 medium-duty truck market. The medium-duty market is influenced 
4

by overall economic conditions but has historically been less cyclical than the North American Class 8 truck market, with highs and lows generally not as pronounced as the Class 8 truck market. As the North American truck fleet companies move to a distribution center model, requiring less long-haul freight vehicles, the demand for medium-duty trucks may increase. 
The following table illustrates the North American Class 5-7 truck build for the years 2015 through 2022:

“E” — Estimated
Source: ACT (February 2018). 
We believe the following factors are primarily responsible for driving the North American Class 8 truck market:
Economic Conditions. The North American truck industry is directly influenced by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Since heavy-duty truck OEMs supply the fleet operators, their production levels generally reflect the demand for freight and the fleet operators' access to capital. 
Truck Replacement Cycle and Fleet Aging.    The average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population is approximately 11.3 years in 2017. The average fleet age tends to run in cycles as freight companies permit their truck fleets to age during periods of lagging demand and then replenish those fleets during periods of increasing demand. As truck fleets age, maintenance costs typically increase. Freight companies evaluate the economics between repair and replacement as well as the potential to utilize more cost-effective technology in vehicles. The chart below illustrates the approximate average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population:
“E” — Estimated
Source: ACT (February 2018). 
Commercial Truck Aftermarket. The GTB Segment sells aftermarket products primarily in North America. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by the quality of OEM parts, the number of vehicles in operation, the average age of the vehicle fleet, the content and value per vehicle, vehicle usage and the average useful life of vehicle parts. Aftermarket sales tend to be at a higher margin. The recurring nature of aftermarket revenue can be expected to provide some insulation to the overall cyclical nature of the industry as it tends to provide a more stable stream of revenues. Brand equity and the extent of a company’s distribution network also contribute to the level of aftermarket sales. We believe CVG has a widely recognized brand portfolio and participates in most retail sales channels including Original Equipment Dealer networks and independent distributors.

Global Construction and Agriculture Industry
Commercial Construction Vehicle Market. New vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions including GDP, infrastructure investment, housing starts, business investment, oil and energy investment and industrial production around the world. Within the construction market, there are two classes of construction equipment markets: the medium and heavy construction equipment market (weighing over 12 metric tons) and the light construction equipment market (weighing below 12 metric tons). Our construction equipment products are primarily used in the medium and heavy construction equipment markets, with a growing emphasis on light and utility machines. The platforms that we generally participate in include: cranes, pavers, planers & profilers, dozers, loaders, graders, haulers, tractors, excavators, backhoes, material handling and compactors. Demand in the medium and heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger-scale infrastructure development projects such as highways, dams, harbors, hospitals, airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining, forestry and other raw material based industries. 
Purchasers of medium and heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies and forestry related industries. Purchasers of light construction equipment include contractors, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies and farmers. In the medium and heavy construction equipment market, we primarily supply OEMs with our wire harness and seating products.
Agricultural Equipment Market. We market most of our products for small, medium and large agricultural equipment across a spectrum of machines including tractors, sprayers, bailers, farm telehandler equipment and harvesters. Sales and production of these vehicles can be influenced by rising or falling farm commodity prices, land values, profitability, and other factors such as increased mechanization in emerging economies and new uses for crop materials such as biofuels and other factors. In the medium to longer term, a combination of factors create the need for more productive agricultural equipment, such as: (1) population growth, (2) an evolving sophistication of dietary habits, and (3) constraints on arable land and other macroeconomic and demographic factors. 
Military Equipment Market. We supply products for heavy- and medium-payload tactical trucks that are used by various military customers. Military equipment production is particularly sensitive to political and governmental budgetary considerations.
OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

Intellectual Property
Our principal intellectual property consists of product and process technology U.S. and foreign patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights. Although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset, we do not believe that any single patent, trade secret, trademark or copyright, or group of patents, trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business. Our policy is to seek statutory protection for all significant intellectual property embodied in patents, trademarks and copyrights.
Our major brands include CVG™, Sprague Devices®, Moto Mirror®, RoadWatch®, KAB Seating™, National Seating™, Bostrom Seating®, Stratos™ and FinishTEK™. We believe that our brands are valuable, but that our business is not dependent on any one brand. We own U.S. federal trademark registrations for several of our products.
Manufacturing Processes
A description of the manufacturing processes we utilize for each of our principal product categories is set forth below:

• | Seats and Seating Systems. Our Seats utilize a variety of manufacturing techniques whereby foam and various other components along with fabric, vinyl or leather are affixed to an underlying seat frame. We also manufacture and assemble seat frames. 


• | Trim Systems and Components. Our Trim capabilities include injection molding, low-pressure injection molding, urethane molding and foaming processes, compression molding, heavy-gauge thermoforming and vacuum forming as well as various cutting, sewing, trimming and finishing methods. 


• | Cab Structures, Sleeper Boxes, Body Panels and Structural Components. We utilize a wide range of manufacturing processes to produce our cab structures, sleeper boxes, body panels and structural components and utilize robotic and manual welding techniques in the assembly of these products. We have facilities with large capacity, fully automated E-coat paint priming systems thereby allowing us to provide our customers with a paint-ready cab product. Due to their high cost, full body E-coat systems, such as ours, are rarely found outside of the manufacturing operations of the major OEMs. 


• | Mirrors, Wipers and Controls. We manufacture our mirrors, wipers and controls utilizing a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques. Our mirrors, wipers and controls are primarily assembled utilizing semi-automatic work cells, electronically tested and then packaged. 


• | Electric Wire Harnesses and Panel Assemblies. We utilize several manufacturing techniques to produce our electric wire harnesses and panel assemblies. Our processes, manual and automated, are designed to produce a wide range of wire harnesses and panel assemblies in short time frames. Our wire harnesses and panel assemblies are electronically and hand tested. 

We have a broad array of processes to enable us to meet our OEM customers’ styling and cost requirements. The vehicle cab is the most significant and appealing aspect to the operator of the vehicle; each commercial vehicle OEM therefore has unique requirements as to feel, appearance and features.
The end markets for our products can be highly specialized and our customers frequently request modified products in low volumes within an expedited delivery timeframe. As a result, we primarily utilize flexible manufacturing cells at our production facilities. Manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations. This provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs. When compared to the more traditional, less flexible assembly line process, cell manufacturing allows us to better maintain our product output consistent with our OEM customers’ requirements and minimize the level of inventory.
When an end-user buys a commercial vehicle, the end-user may specify the seat and other features for that vehicle. Because our Seats are unique, our manufacturing facilities have significant complexity which we manage by building in sequence. We build our Seats as orders are received, and the Seats are delivered to our customer’s rack in the sequence in which vehicles come down the assembly line. We have systems in place that allow us to provide complete customized interior kits in boxes that are delivered in sequence. Sequencing reduces our cost of production because it eliminates warehousing costs and reduces waste and obsolescence, offsetting any increased labor costs. Several of our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near our customers’ assembly plants, which facilitates this process and minimizes shipping costs.
We employ just-in-time manufacturing and sourcing in our operations to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries and to minimize our need to carry significant inventory levels. We utilize material systems to manage inventory levels and, in certain locations, we have inventory delivered as often as two times per day from a nearby facility based on the previous day’s order, which reduces the need to carry excess inventory at our facilities.
9

Within our cyclical industries, we strive to maintain a certain portion of temporary labor to improve our ability to flex our costs and throughput as required by fluctuating customer demand. We engage our core employees to assist in making our processes efficient. 
Seasonality
OEMs close their production facilities around holidays or when demand drops, reducing work days. Our cost structure, to the extent it is variable, provides us with some flexibility during these periods.
Our Supply Agreements
Our supply agreements generally provide for fixed pricing but do not require us to purchase any specified quantities. Normally we do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules, as well as service requirements. Steel, aluminum, petroleum-based products, copper, resin, foam, fabrics, wire and wire components comprise the most significant portion of our raw material costs. We typically purchase steel, copper and petroleum-based products at market prices that are fixed over varying periods of time. Due to the volatility in pricing over the last several years, we use methods such as market index pricing and competitive bidding to assist in reducing our overall cost. We strive to align our customer pricing and material costs to minimize the impact of steel, copper and petrochemical price fluctuations. Certain component purchases and suppliers are directed by our customers, so we generally will pass through directly to the customer any cost changes from these components. We generally are not dependent on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers for our raw materials.
Our Customer Contracts
Our OEM customers generally source business to us pursuant to written contracts, purchase orders or other firm commitments (“Commercial Arrangements”) with terms of price, quality, technology and delivery. Awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer’s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products. In general, these Commercial Arrangements provide that the customer can terminate them if we do not meet specified quality, delivery and cost requirements. Although these Commercial Arrangements may be terminated at any time by our customers (but not by us), such terminations have historically been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations. Because we produce products for a broad cross section of vehicle models, we are not overly reliant on any one vehicle model.
Our Commercial Arrangements with our OEM customers may provide for an annual prospective productivity cost reduction. These productivity cost reductions are generally calculated on an annual basis as a percentage of the previous year’s purchases by each customer. Historically, most of these cost reductions have been offset by internal cost reductions and through the assistance of our supply base, although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such reductions in the future. The cost reduction is achieved through engineering changes, material cost reductions, logistics savings, reductions in packaging cost, labor efficiencies and other productivity actions. 
Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to create customer awareness of our engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities. Our sales and marketing staff work closely with our design and engineering personnel to prepare the materials used for bidding on new business, as well as to provide a consistent interface between us and our key customers. We have sales and marketing personnel located in every major region in which we operate. From time to time, we participate in industry trade shows and advertise in industry publications.
Our principal customers for our aftermarket sales include OEM dealers and independent wholesale or retail distributors. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on support of these two distribution chains, as well as participation in industry trade shows and direct contact with major fleets.
Competition
Within each of our principal product categories we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and with OEMs’ in-house operations, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product offerings, product quality, technical expertise, development capability, product delivery and product service. A summary of our primary competitors is set forth below:
Seats and Seating Systems.    We believe we have a strong market position supplying Seats to the North American MD/HD Truck market. Our primary competitors in the North American commercial vehicle market include Sears Manufacturing Company, Isringhausen, Grammer AG and Seats, Inc. Our primary competitors in the European commercial vehicle market include Grammer AG and Isringhausen; and in the Asia-Pacific region include Isrihuatai and Tiancheng (in China); and Harita and Pinnacle (in India).

Trim Systems and Components.    We believe we have a good position supplying Trim products to the North American MD/HD Truck market. We face competition from a number of different competitors with respect to each of our trim system products and components. Our primary competitors are ConMet, International Automotive Components, Superior, Blachford Ltd. and Grupo Antolin.
Cab Structures, Sleeper Boxes, Body Panels and Structural Components.    We are a supplier of cab structural components, cab structures, sleeper boxes and body panels to the North American MD/HD Truck market. Our primary competitors in this category are Magna, International Equipment Solutions (formerly Crenlo), Worthington Industries (formerly Angus Palm), McLaughlin Body Company and Defiance Metal Products.
Mirrors, Wipers and Controls.    We are a supplier of wiper systems and mirrors to the North American MD/HD Truck market. We also sell wiper systems to the construction and agriculture market in Europe. We face competition from various competitors in this category. Our principal competitors for mirrors are Hadley, Retrac, and Lang-Mekra and our principal competitors for wiper systems are Doga, Wexco, Trico and Valeo.
Electric Wire Harnesses and Panel Assemblies.    We supply a wide range of electric wire harnesses and panel assemblies used in various commercial and other vehicles. Our primary competitors for wire harnesses include large diversified suppliers such as Delphi Automotive PLC, Leoni, Nexans SA, Motherson-Sumi, St. Clair and Electrical Components International as well as many smaller companies.
Backlog
Our customers may place annual blanket purchase orders that do not obligate them to purchase any specific or minimum amount of products from us until a release is issued by the customer under the blanket purchase order. Releases are typically placed 30 to 90 days prior to required delivery and may be canceled at any time within agreed terms. We do not believe that our backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 8,250 permanent employees, of whom approximately 14% were salaried and the remainder were hourly.  As of December 31, 2017, approximately 56% of the employees in our North American operations were unionized, with the majority of union-represented personnel based in Mexico.  On January 24, 2017, workers in our Shadyside, Ohio facility ratified a Closure Effects Agreement between Mayflower Vehicle Systems, LLC and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing and Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union and its affiliated Local Union 9419. Production ceased in that facility in July 2017 and no hourly employees remained in the facility as of year-end.  Approximately 64% of our European, Asian and Australian operations were represented by shop steward committees.
We did not experience any material strikes, lockouts or work stoppages during 2017 and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.  On an as-needed basis during peak periods we utilize contract and temporary employees.  During periods of weak demand, we respond to reduced volumes through flexible scheduling, furloughs and/or reductions in force as necessary. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, ground or air; and the health and safety of our colleagues. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot give assurances that we are, or have been, in complete compliance with such environmental and safety laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In some instances, such a fine or sanction could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property. Under these laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances. The amount of such liability could be material.
Certain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes. If a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties, or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken, or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties, we may be held liable for the cost of cleanup and for any other response by governmental authorities or private parties, together with any associated fines, penalties or damages. In most jurisdictions, this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes.

Government Regulations
New emissions regulations were approved in 2016 by US regulators impacting MD/HD Truck manufacturers. The regulations require manufacturers to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2027. Other countries are implementing clean air measures to reduce air pollution. For example, China's Ministry of Environment implemented new standards applicable during 2017 for Stage V vehicles, including light gasoline-powered vehicles, diesel-powered passenger vehicles and heavy diesel-powered vehicles manufactured and sold in China. 
Under a California law known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must appear on any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to them. Certain of our products may be subject to Proposition 65 and therefore cause us to have to provide warnings on the products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label.
To the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
