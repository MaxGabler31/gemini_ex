Item 1.    Business
Overview 
CVR Energy, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, its subsidiaries ("CVR Energy," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing industries through its holdings in CVR Refining, LP ("CVR Refining" or the "Refining Partnership") and CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners" or the "Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership"). The Refining Partnership is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of UAN and ammonia. We own the general partner and approximately 66% and 34% respectively, of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in each of the Refining Partnership and the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership. CVR Energy's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "CVI," the Refining Partnership's common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "CVRR" and the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership's common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "UAN." As of December 31, 2017, Icahn Enterprises L.P. and its affiliates owned approximately 82% of our outstanding common stock. 
We operate under two business segments: petroleum (the petroleum and related businesses operated by the Refining Partnership) and nitrogen fertilizer (the nitrogen fertilizer business operated by the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership). Throughout the remainder of this document, our business segments are referred to as the "petroleum business" and the "nitrogen fertilizer business," respectively. 
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated consolidated net sales of $6.0 billion, $4.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, and operating income of $177.8 million, $90.9 million and $421.6 million, respectively. The petroleum business generated $5.7 billion, $4.4 billion and $5.2 billion of net sales and the nitrogen fertilizer business generated $330.8 million, $356.3 million and $289.2 million of net sales, in each case, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The petroleum business generated operating income of $203.8 million, $77.8 million and $361.7 million and the nitrogen fertilizer business generated operating income (loss) of $(9.2) million, $26.8 million and $68.7 million, in each case, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our consolidated results of operations include certain other unallocated corporate activities and the elimination of intercompany transactions and, therefore, are not a sum of the operating results of the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses.
Refer to Item 1, "Petroleum Business" and Item 1, "Nitrogen Fertilizer Business" and Item 8, Note 19 ("Business Segments") for further details on our business segments.

Petroleum Business
The petroleum business, operated by the Refining Partnership, includes a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas with a rated capacity of 115,000 bpcd and a complex crude oil refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd capable of processing 20,000 bpcd of light sour crude oil (within its rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd). The combined crude capacity represents approximately 23% of the region's refining capacity. The Coffeyville refinery located in southeast Kansas is approximately 100 miles from Cushing, Oklahoma ("Cushing"), a major crude oil trading and storage hub. The Wynnewood refinery is located approximately 65 miles south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and approximately 130 miles from Cushing.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Coffeyville refinery's product yield included gasoline (50%), diesel fuel (primarily ultra-low sulfur diesel ("ULSD")) (42%), and pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids ("NGL") (propane and butane), slurry, sulfur and gas oil (8%). The Wynnewood refinery's product yield included gasoline (51%), diesel fuel (primarily ULSD) (37%), asphalt (5%), jet fuel (4%) and other products (3%) (slurry, sulfur and gas oil, and specialty products such as propylene and solvents).
The petroleum business also includes the following auxiliary operating assets:

• | Crude Oil Gathering System. The petroleum business owns and operates a crude oil gathering system serving Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado and Texas. The system has field offices in Bartlesville and Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, Plainville and Winfield, Kansas and Denver, Colorado. The gathering system includes approximately 570 miles of active owned, leased and joint venture pipelines and approximately 130 crude oil transports and associated storage facilities, which allows it to gather crude oils from independent crude oil producers. The crude oil gathering system has a gathering capacity of over 80,000 bpd currently. Gathered crude oil provides an attractive and competitive base supply of crude oil for the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries. During 2017, the petroleum business gathered approximately 86,000 bpd of price advantaged crudes from our gather area. The petroleum business also has 35,000 bpd of contracted capacity on the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines that allow it to supply price-advantaged Canadian crude to its refineries. It also has contracted capacity on the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, which both became in-service during 2015. Both the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines originate in Colorado and extend to Cushing. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Refining Partnership entered into a 50/50 joint venture, Midway Pipeline LLC ("Midway"), with a subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ("Plains"), which acquired the approximately 100-mile, 16-inch pipeline that connects the Coffeyville refinery to Cushing, and the Refining Partnership separately acquired from Plains the approximately 100-mile, 8- and 10-inch pipeline system connecting the Wynnewood refinery to Cushing. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 7 ("Equity Method Investments") of this Report for a discussion of the joint venture transaction. 


• | Pipelines and Storage Tanks. The petroleum business owns a proprietary pipeline system capable of transporting approximately 170,000 bpd of crude oil from its Broome Station facility located near Caney, Kansas to its Coffeyville refinery. Crude oils sourced outside of the proprietary gathering system are delivered by common carrier pipelines into various terminals in Cushing, where they are blended and then delivered to the Broome Station tank farm via a pipeline owned by Midway. Crude oil is transported via the Cushing to Ellis crude oil pipeline system acquired from Plains and, beginning in April 2017, the petroleum business also transports crude oil via a 65,000 bpd pipeline owned and operated by the VPP joint venture, to the Wynnewood refinery from a trucking terminal at Lowrance, Oklahoma. The petroleum business owns approximately (i) 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity that supports the gathering system and the Coffeyville refinery, (ii) 0.9 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity at the Wynnewood refinery and (iii) 1.5 million barrels of crude oil storage capacity in Cushing. The petroleum business also leases additional crude oil storage capacity of approximately 2.3 million barrels in Cushing and 0.2 million barrels in Duncan, Oklahoma. The Duncan storage supports CVR Refining's Wynnewood refinery while the Cushing storage supports both its Wynnewood and Coffeyville refineries. In addition to crude oil storage, the petroleum business owns over 4.6 million barrels of combined refined products and feedstocks storage capacity. 


• | Marketing and Product Supply. The petroleum business also has a rack marketing division supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in geographic proximity to Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma and to customers at throughput terminals on Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. ("Magellan") and NuStar Energy, LP's ("NuStar") refined products distribution systems.

The refineries' complexity allows the petroleum business to optimize the yields (the percentage of refined product that is produced from crude oil and other feedstocks) of higher value transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel). Complexity is a measure of a refinery's ability to process lower quality crude oil and feedstocks in an economic manner. The two refineries' capacity weighted average complexity is 13.0. As a result of key investments in its refining assets and the addition of process units to comply with gasoline quality regulations, both of the refinery's complexities have increased. The Coffeyville refinery's complexity score is 13.3, and the Wynnewood refinery's complexity score is 12.6. The petroleum business' higher complexity provides it the flexibility to increase its refining margin over comparable refiners with lower complexities. The petroleum business has achieved significant increases in its refinery crude throughput rates over historical levels. As a result of the increasing complexities, the petroleum business is capable of processing a variety of crudes, including WTS, WTI, sweet and sour Canadian, and locally gathered crudes.

Crude and Feedstock Supply
The Coffeyville refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from heavy sour to light sweet crude oil. Currently, the Coffeyville refinery crude oil slate consists of a blend of mid-continent domestic grades and various Canadian medium and heavy sours, and North Dakota Bakken and other similarly sourced crudes. While crude oil has historically constituted over 90% of the Coffeyville refinery's total throughput over the last five years, other feedstock inputs include normal butane, natural gasoline, alkylation feeds, naphtha, gas oil and vacuum tower bottoms.
The Wynnewood refinery has the capability to process blends of a variety of crude oil ranging from medium sour to light sweet crude oil, although isobutane, gasoline components, and normal butane are also typically used. Historically most of the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil has been acquired domestically, mainly from Texas and Oklahoma, but it can also access and process various light and medium Canadian grades.
Crude oil is supplied to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries through the wholly-owned gathering system and by owned, leased and joint venture pipelines. The petroleum business has continued to increase the number of barrels of crude oil supplied through its crude oil gathering system in 2017 and it now has the capacity of supplying over 80,000 bpd of crude oil to the refineries. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the gathering system supplied approximately 44% and 49% of the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries' crude oil demand, respectively. Locally produced crude oils are delivered to the refineries at a discount to WTI, and although sometimes slightly heavier and more sour, offer good economics to the refineries. These crude oils are light and sweet enough to allow the refineries to blend higher percentages of lower cost crude oils such as heavy sour Canadian crude oil while maintaining their target medium sour blend with an API gravity of between 28 and 36 degrees and between 0.9% and 1.2% sulfur. Crude oils sourced outside of the proprietary gathering system are delivered to Cushing by various pipelines including the Keystone and Spearhead pipelines, and subsequently to the Broome Station facility via the Midway joint venture pipeline. The petroleum business' current contracted capacity includes the Pony Express and White Cliffs pipelines, respectively. From the Broome Station facility, crude oil is delivered to the Coffeyville refinery via the petroleum business' 170,000 bpd proprietary pipeline system. Crude oils are delivered to the Wynnewood refinery through third-party pipelines, the pipeline acquired from Plains and, beginning in April 2017, through the VPP joint venture pipeline, and received into storage tanks at terminals located on or near the refinery.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Coffeyville refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised of approximately 92% light sweet crude oil and 8% heavy sour crude oil. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Wynnewood refinery's crude oil supply blend was comprised of entirely of light sweet crude oil. The light sweet crude oil supply blend includes its locally gathered crude oil.
The Coffeyville refinery is connected to the mid-continent natural gas liquids commercial hub of Conway, Kansas by the inbound Enterprise Pipeline Blue Line. Natural gas liquids feedstock supplies such as butanes and natural gasoline are sourced and delivered directly into the refinery. In addition, Coffeyville's proximity to Conway provides access to the natural gas liquid and liquid petroleum gas fractionation and storage capabilities as well as the commercial markets available at Conway.
Crude Oil Supply Agreement
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report for information on the crude oil supply agreement.

Refining Process
Coffeyville Refinery 
The Coffeyville refinery is a 115,000 bpcd rated capacity facility with operations including fractionation, catalytic cracking, hydrotreating, reforming, coking, isomerization, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery. The Coffeyville refinery benefits from significant refining unit redundancies, which include two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers, three sulfur recovery units and four hydrotreating units. These redundancies allow the Refining Partnership to continue to receive and process crude oil even if one tower requires unplanned maintenance without having to shut down the entire refinery in the case of a major unit turnaround. In addition, the Coffeyville refinery has a redundant supply of hydrogen pursuant to its feedstock and shared services agreement with a subsidiary of CVR Partners. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Coffeyville refinery processed approximately 132,000 bpd and 9,000 bpd of crude oil and feedstocks and blendstocks, respectively. 
Wynnewood Refinery
The Wynnewood refinery is a 70,000 bpcd rated capacity facility with operations including fractionation, cracking, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, reforming, solvent deasphalting, alkylation, sulfur recovery and propane and butane recovery. Similar to the Coffeyville refinery, the Wynnewood refinery benefits from unit redundancies, including two crude oil distillation and vacuum towers and four hydrotreating units. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our Wynnewood refinery processed approximately 73,000 bpd and 3,000 bpd of crude oil and feedstocks and blendstocks, respectively. These throughput rates for 2017 reflect the first phase of the major scheduled turnaround completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Marketing and Distribution
The petroleum business focuses its Coffeyville petroleum product marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area, because of its relative proximity to the refinery and pipeline access. Coffeyville also has access to the Rocky Mountain area. Coffeyville engages in rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks and railcars directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to the refinery and to customers at throughput terminals on the refined products distribution systems of Magellan and NuStar. Coffeyville also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into the mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing the product pipeline networks owned by Magellan, Enterprise and NuStar. The outbound Enterprise Pipeline Red Line provides Coffeyville with access to the NuStar Refined Products Pipeline system. This allows gasoline and ULSD product sales from Kansas up into North Dakota.
The Wynnewood refinery ships its finished product via pipeline, railcar, and truck. It focuses its efforts in the southern portion of the Magellan system which covers all of Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas as well as eastern Missouri, and all other Magellan terminals. The pipeline system is also able to flow in the opposite direction, providing access to Texas markets as well as some adjoining states with pipeline connections. Wynnewood also sells jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense via its segregated truck rack and can offer asphalts, solvents and other specialty products via both truck and rail.
Customers
Customers for the refined petroleum products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the refineries and pipeline access. The petroleum business sells bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service.
11

The petroleum business also has a rack marketing business supplying product through tanker trucks directly to customers located in proximity to the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, as well as to customers located at throughput terminals on refined products distribution systems run by Magellan and NuStar. Rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, the Wynnewood refinery supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition, the Coffeyville refinery sells hydrogen and by-products of its refining operations, such as petroleum coke, to an affiliate, CVR Partners, pursuant to separate multi-year agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, only one customer accounted for 10% or more of the petroleum business' consolidated revenues. Its largest customer accounted for approximately 19% of its net sales and approximately 52% of net sales were made to its ten largest customers. While the petroleum business does have a high concentration of customers, it does not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Both the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses depend on significant customers and the loss of several significant customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Competition
The petroleum business competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstock costs, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of the refineries provides the petroleum business with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over its competitors. The petroleum business primarily competes against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, the refineries compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast and the Texas panhandle region. The petroleum business refinery competition also includes branded, integrated and independent oil refining companies, such as Phillips 66, HollyFrontier Corporation, CHS Inc., Valero Energy Corporation and Flint Hills Resources.
Seasonality
The petroleum business experiences seasonal effects as demand for gasoline products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and road construction work. Demand for diesel fuel is higher during the planting and harvesting seasons. As a result, the petroleum business' results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower compared to its results for the second and third calendar quarters. In addition, unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which the petroleum business sells its petroleum products can impact the demand for gasoline and diesel fuel. The demand for asphalt is also seasonal and is generally higher during the months of March through October.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Business
The nitrogen fertilizer business, operated by the Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership, consists of two nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois. The nitrogen fertilizer business produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia, and all products are sold on a wholesale basis. The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility includes a 1,300 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit, a 3,000 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit and a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility is the only nitrogen fertilizer plant in North America that utilizes a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque Facility, which includes a 1,075 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit, has the flexibility to vary its product mix enabling the East Dubuque Facility to upgrade a portion of its ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea each season, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. The East Dubuque Facility's product sales are heavily weighted toward sales of ammonia and UAN. 
12

Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility
The Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility was built in 2000 and uses a gasification process to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia. The Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer facility's pet coke gasification process results in a higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. During the past five years, over 70% of the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer facility's pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement. Historically the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership is party to a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation that ends December 2018, and has historically renewed this agreement annually. If necessary, there are other pet coke suppliers. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership also purchased some of its hydrogen from CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a long-term agreement.
The pet coke gasification process is licensed from an affiliate of General Electric Company. The license grants the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility perpetual rights to use the pet coke gasification process on specified terms and conditions, and the license is fully paid.
Linde LLC ("Linde") owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility gasifiers. 
East Dubuque Facility
The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque Facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. The pipelines are connected to Nicor Inc.’s distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect from which natural gas is transported to the East Dubuque Facility. 
Changes in the levels of natural gas prices and market prices of nitrogen-based products can materially affect the East Dubuque Facility's financial position and results of operations. Natural gas prices in the United States have experienced significant fluctuations over the last decade, increasing substantially in 2008 and subsequently declining to the current lower levels. From time to time, the nitrogen fertilizer business enters into forward contracts with fixed delivery prices to purchase portions of its natural gas requirements. As of December 31, 2017, the nitrogen business segment had commitments to purchase approximately 1.8 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in its East Dubuque Facility in January and February 2018 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of approximately $3.20, exclusive of transportation cost.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
The primary geographic markets for the nitrogen fertilizer business' fertilizer products are Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas. The nitrogen fertilizer business' primarily market the UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers. UAN and ammonia accounted for approximately 67% and 25%, respectively, of its total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a freight-on-board ("FOB") shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. The nitrogen fertilizer business leases and owns a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery, and, if delivered by railcar, the products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and the nitrogen fertilizer business typically arranges the freight. 
The nitrogen fertilizer business's fertilizer products leave the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. The East Dubuque Facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Facility and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. 
13

The nitrogen fertilizer business has the capacity to store approximately 160,000 tons of UAN and 80,000 tons of ammonia. The nitrogen fertilizer's business storage tanks are located primarily at its two production facilities. Inventories are often allowed to accumulate to allow customers to take delivery to meet the seasonal demand. While the nitrogen fertilizer business does experience higher sales volumes due to seasonality during the fall and spring application periods, product is sold to customers throughout the year.
The nitrogen fertilizer business offers agricultural products on a spot, forward or prepay basis and often uses forward sales of fertilizer products to optimize its asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that it proposes. The nitrogen fertilizer business uses this program to varying degrees during the year and between years depending on the nitrogen fertilizer business view of market conditions. Fixing the selling prices of nitrogen fertilizer products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes the nitrogen fertilizer business reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment. 
Customers
The nitrogen fertilizer business sells UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, it sells ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of its business, and consistent with industry practice, the nitrogen fertilizer business does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with most of its agricultural customers. Some of our industrial sales include long-term purchase contracts.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the top five customers in the aggregate represented 31% of the nitrogen fertilizer business' net sales. The nitrogen fertilizer business' top customer on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 11% of its net sales. While the nitrogen fertilizer business does have high concentration of customers, it does not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Both the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses depend on significant customers and the loss of several significant customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Competition
The nitrogen fertilizer business has experienced and expects to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Nitrogen fertilizer products are global commodities, and the nitrogen fertilizer business faces intense competition from other nitrogen fertilizer producers.
Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. The nitrogen fertilizer business maintains a large fleet of leased and owned railcars and seasonally adjusts inventory to enhance its manufacturing and distribution operations.
The nitrogen fertilizer business' major competitors include CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P.; Koch Fertilizer Company, LLC; and Nutrien Ltd. (formerly known as Agrium, Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.). Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. The nitrogen fertilizer business also encounters competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments. 
Seasonality
Because the nitrogen fertilizer business primarily sells agricultural commodity products, its business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers' current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. The nitrogen fertilizer business typically experiences higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which is referred to as the planting season, and its net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which is referred to as the fill season. 
14

Environmental Matters
The petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, and the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.

Our operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs.
The principal environmental risks associated with our businesses are outlined below, with additional details included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report.
The Federal Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts may occur through the federal Clean Air Act's permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain regulated substances. The federal Clean Air Act indirectly affects the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business by extensively regulating the air emissions of sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and other substances, including those emitted by mobile sources, which are direct or indirect users of our products.
Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to the petroleum business or the nitrogen fertilizer facilities in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. These new requirements, other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, or other presently existing or future environmental regulations, could cause us to expend substantial resources to comply and/or permit our facilities to produce products that meet applicable requirements.
The regulation of air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer operations when regulations change or we add new equipment or modify existing equipment. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"), New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") and New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD"). 
On September 12, 2012, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") published in the Federal Register final revisions to its NSPS for process heaters and flares at petroleum refineries. The EPA originally issued final standards in June 2008, but the portions of the rule relating to process heaters and flares were stayed pending reconsideration of certain provisions. The final standards regulate emissions of nitrogen oxide from process heaters and emissions of SO2 from flares, as well as require certain work practice and monitoring standards for flares. We do not believe that the costs of complying with the rule are material.

On December 1, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register the petroleum refining sector risk rule. The rule places additional emission control requirements and work practice standards on FCCUs, storage tanks, flares, coking units and other equipment at petroleum refineries. CVR Refining Partnership does not believe that the costs of complying with the rule are material.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies") of this Report for further discussion of recent environmental matters related to the Clean Air Act including the "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" and certain "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters." 
The Federal Clean Water Act
The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of pollutants into the water, affect the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business. Direct impacts occur through the CWA's permitting requirements, which establish discharge limitations based on technology standards, water quality standards, and restrictions on the total maximum daily load of pollutants that may be released to a particular water body based on its use. In addition, water resources are becoming and in the future may become scarcer, and many refiners, including CRRM and Wynnewood Refining Company, LLC ("WRC"), are subject to restrictions on their ability to use water in the event of low availability conditions. Both CRRM and WRC have contracts in place to receive water during certain water shortage conditions, but these conditions could change over time if water becomes scarce.

Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. Our facilities periodically experience releases of hazardous and extremely hazardous substances from its equipment. Our facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned start-up, shutdown and malfunction events. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to timely or properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Fuel Regulations
Tier 2, Low Sulfur Fuels.    In February 2000, the EPA promulgated the Tier 2 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards Final Rule for all passenger vehicles, establishing standards for sulfur content in gasoline that were required to be met by 2006. In addition, in January 2001, the EPA promulgated its on-road diesel regulations, which required a 97% reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel sold for highway use by June 1, 2006, with full compliance by January 1, 2010. The refineries are in compliance with the EPA's low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel standards.
Tier 3.    In April 2014, the EPA promulgated the Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards, which will require that gasoline contain no more than ten parts per million of sulfur on an annual average basis. Refineries were required to be in compliance with the more stringent emission standards as of January 1, 2017; however, compliance with the rule has been extended until January 1, 2020 for approved small volume refineries and small refiners. In June 2016, because it exceeded the EPA’s specified throughput limit for a “small volume refinery,” the Wynnewood refinery became disqualified as a “small volume refinery.” Therefore, the Wynnewood refinery’s compliance deadline was accelerated to December 21, 2018. It is not anticipated that the refineries will require additional controls or capital expenditures to meet the anticipated new standard.
Mobile Source Air Toxic II Emissions
In 2007, the EPA promulgated the Mobile Source Air Toxic II ("MSAT II") rule that required the reduction of benzene in gasoline by 2011. The MSAT II projects for CRRM and WRC were completed within the compliance deadline of November 1, 2014. The refineries are in compliance with the EPA's MSAT II rule.
Renewable Fuel Standards
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if the petroleum business has to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if the petroleum business is otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, the petroleum business' financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" of this Report for further discussion of the "Renewable Fuel Standards."
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, of this Report for further discussion of the Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions regulations. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA")
Our operations are subject to the RCRA requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. When feasible, RCRA-regulated materials are recycled instead of being disposed of on-site or off-site. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides governing current waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal practices, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks containing regulated substances. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Environmental, Health and Safety ("EHS") Matters" for further discussion of "RCRA Compliance Matters."

Waste Management.    There are two closed hazardous waste units at the Coffeyville refinery and fourteen other solid waste management units in the process of being closed pending state agency approval. There is one closed hazardous waste unit and one active hazardous waste storage tank at the Wynnewood refinery. In addition, one closed interim status hazardous waste land farm located at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is under long-term post closure care.
Impacts of Past Manufacturing.  In March 2004, CRRM and Coffeyville Resources Terminal, LLC ("CRT") entered into a Consent Decree ("2004 Consent Decree") with the EPA and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (the "KDHE") which required us to assume two RCRA corrective action orders issued to Farmland, the prior owner of the Coffeyville refinery. We are subject to a 1994 EPA administrative order related to investigation of possible past releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Coffeyville refinery. In accordance with the order, we have documented existing soil and groundwater conditions, which required investigation and interim remediation projects. In June 2017, the Coffeyville refinery submitted an amended post-closure permit application to KDHE to complete closure of former hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville refinery and to perform corrective action at the site. The now-closed Phillipsburg terminal is subject to a 1996 EPA administrative order related to investigation of releases of hazardous materials to the environment at the Phillipsburg terminal, which operated as a refinery until 1991. The Phillipsburg terminal continues to implement interim measures to address the investigation’s findings. Further remediation, if ordered necessary by the EPA or the state, will be based on the results of the investigation. The Wynnewood refinery operates under a RCRA permit. A RCRA facility investigation has been completed in accordance with the terms of the permit. Based on the facility investigation and other available information, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality ("ODEQ") and WRC have entered into a consent order requiring further investigations of groundwater conditions and enhancements of existing remediation systems. The Wynnewood refinery has completed the groundwater investigation and ODEQ has approved our corrective action recommendations.
The anticipated investigation and remediation costs through 2021 were estimated, as of December 31, 2017, to be as follows:

Facility | SiteInvestigationCosts | | CapitalCosts | | Total Operation & Maintenance Costs Through 2021 | | Total Estimated Costs Through 2021
 | (in millions) 
Coffeyville Refinery | $ | 0.1 | | | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 0.1
Phillipsburg Terminal | 0.3 | | | — | | | — | | 0.3
Wynnewood Refinery | — | | | 2.7 | | | 0.9 | | 3.6
Total Estimated Costs | $ | 0.4 | | | $ | 2.7 | | $ | 0.9 | $ | 4.0

These estimates are based on current information and could increase or decrease as additional information becomes available through our ongoing remediation and investigation activities. At this point, we have estimated that, over ten years starting in 2018, we will spend approximately $7.2 million to remedy impacts from past manufacturing activity at the Coffeyville refinery and to address existing soil and groundwater contamination at the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal and at the Wynnewood refinery. It is possible that additional costs will be required after this ten year period. We spent approximately $2.0 million in 2017 associated with related remediation.
Financial Assurance.    We are required under the 2004 Consent Decree to establish financial assurance to secure the projected clean-up costs posed by the Coffeyville and the now-closed Phillipsburg facilities in the event we fail to fulfill our clean-up obligations. In accordance with the 2004 Consent Decree as modified by a 2010 agreement between CRRM, CRT, the EPA and the KDHE, this financial assurance is currently provided by a bond in the amount of $3.0 million for clean-up obligations at the Phillipsburg terminal and a letter of credit in the amount of $0.3 million for estimated costs to close regulated hazardous waste management units at the Coffeyville refinery. Additional self-funded financial assurance of approximately $5.6 million and $2.5 million is required by our post-closure care obligations and the 2004 Consent Decree for clean-up costs at the Coffeyville refinery and Phillipsburg terminal, respectively. The $3.0 million bond amount is reduced each year based on actual expenditures for corrective actions and the letter of credit and the self-funded mechanisms are re-evaluated and adjusted on an annual basis. Current RCRA financial assurance requirements for the Wynnewood refinery total $0.2 million for hazardous waste storage tank closure and post-closure monitoring of a closed storm water retention pond.

Environmental Remediation
As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by crude oil or hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. There is no assurance that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or crude oil or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Flood, Crude Oil Discharge and Insurance" of this Report for discussion of the environmental remediation associated with the discharge of crude oil on July 1, 2007 at the Coffeyville refinery. 
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by a site pollution legal liability insurance policy. The policy includes business interruption coverage. The policy insures any location owned, leased or rented or operated by the Company, including the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries and the nitrogen fertilizer facility. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at or migrating from a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we maintain umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies which include sudden and accidental pollution coverage. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period.
The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies are subject to retentions and deductibles and contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.

We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 15 ("Commitments and Contingencies"), "Wynnewood Refinery Incident" of this Report for further discussion of OSHA matters related to the Wynnewood refinery boiler explosion. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, 959 employees were employed by the petroleum business, 308 employees were employed by the nitrogen fertilizer business and 173 employees were employed by the Company at our offices in Sugar Land, Texas and Kansas City, Kansas. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Partnership and the Refining Partnership each relies on the services of employees of CVR Energy and its subsidiaries pursuant to services agreements between each partnership, its general partner and CVR Energy. As of December 31, 2017, all these employees are covered by health insurance, disability and retirement plans established by the Company. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
