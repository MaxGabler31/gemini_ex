 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 Tutor Perini Corporation, formerly known as Perini Corporation, was incorporated in 1918 as a successor to businesses that had been engaged in providing construction services since 1894. Tutor Perini Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Tutor Perini,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” unless the context indicates otherwise) is a leading construction company, based on revenue as ranked by Engineering News-Record (“ENR”), offering diversified general contracting, construction management and design-build services to private customers and public agencies throughout the world. Our corporate headquarters are in Los Angeles (Sylmar), California, and we have various other principal offices throughout the United States and its territories (see Item 2. Properties for a listing of our major facilities). Our common stock (“Common Stock”) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TPC.” We are incorporated in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
 ﻿
 We have established a strong reputation within our markets for executing large, complex projects on time and within budget while adhering to strict quality control measures. We offer general contracting, pre-construction planning and comprehensive project management services, including the planning and scheduling of the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for a project. We also offer self-performed construction services including site work; concrete forming and placement; steel erection; electrical; mechanical; plumbing; heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); and fire protection. During 2017, we performed work on approximately 1,500 construction projects.
 ﻿
 In 2017, ENR ranked Tutor Perini as the ninth largest domestic contractor. We are recognized as one of the leading civil contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our past and current performance on several of the country’s largest mass-transit and transportation projects, such as the East Side Access project in New York City, the California High-Speed Rail System, the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) project in Seattle, McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas, major portions of the Red Line and Purple Line segments of the Los Angeles subway system, and the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown. We are also recognized as one of the leading building contractors in the United States, as evidenced by our performance on several of the country’s largest building development projects, including CityCenter and the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas and Hudson Yards in New York City.
 ﻿
 Since the 2008 merger between our predecessor companies, Tutor-Saliba Corporation (“Tutor-Saliba”) and Perini Corporation, we have experienced significant growth supported by our increased size, scale, bonding capacity, access to broader geographic regions, expanded management capabilities, complementary assets and particular expertise in large, complex projects. In 2010 and 2011, we expanded vertically and geographically through the strategic acquisitions of seven companies with demonstrated success in their respective markets. These acquisitions further strengthened our geographic presence in our Building and Civil segments and also significantly increased our specialty contracting capabilities. In 2011, we completed an internal reorganization of our reporting segments with the creation of the Specialty Contractors segment, which we describe below.
 ﻿
 Our acquisitions have enabled us to provide customers with a vertically integrated service offering. This vertical integration is a unique capability and competitive advantage that allows us to self-perform a greater amount of work than our competitors. Our vertical integration increases our competitiveness in bidding and our efficiency in managing and executing large, complex projects. It also provides us with significant cross-selling opportunities across a broad geographic footprint.

Business Segment Overview
 ﻿
 Our business is conducted through three segments: Civil, Building and Specialty Contractors.
 ﻿
 Civil Segment
 ﻿
 Our Civil segment specializes in public works construction and the replacement and reconstruction of infrastructure across most of the major geographic regions of the United States. Our civil contracting services include construction and rehabilitation of highways, bridges, tunnels, mass-transit systems, and water management and wastewater treatment facilities. 
 ﻿
 The Civil segment is comprised of the Company’s legacy heavy civil construction operations (civil operations of our predecessors, Tutor-Saliba, its subsidiary Black Construction, and Perini Corporation), as well as Frontier-Kemper, Lunda Construction and Becho. The Company’s legacy heavy civil units operate primarily on the West Coast and East Coast of the United States and are engaged in a variety of large mass-transit, transportation, bridge and highway projects. Frontier-Kemper is a heavy civil contractor engaged in the construction of tunnels for highways, railroads, subways and rapid transit systems; the construction of shafts and other facilities for water supply, wastewater transport and hydroelectric projects; and the development and equipping of mines with innovative hoisting, elevator and vertical conveyance systems. Lunda Construction is a heavy civil contractor specializing in the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of bridges, railroads and other civil structures throughout the United States. Becho is engaged in drilling, foundation and excavation support for shoring, bridges, piers, roads and highway projects, primarily in the southwestern United States. We believe that the Company has benefitted from these acquisitions by an expanded geographic presence, enhanced civil construction capabilities and the addition of experienced management with proven, successful track records.
 ﻿
 Our Civil segment’s customers primarily award contracts through one of two methods: the traditional public “competitive bid” method, in which price is the major determining factor, or through a request for proposal, where contracts are awarded based on a combination of technical qualifications, proposed project team, schedule, past performance on similar projects and price.
 ﻿
 Traditionally, our Civil segment’s customers require each contractor to pre-qualify for construction business by meeting criteria that include technical capabilities and financial strength. Our financial strength and outstanding record of performance on challenging civil works projects often enable us to pre-qualify for projects in situations where smaller, less diversified contractors are unable to meet the qualification requirements. We believe this is a competitive advantage that makes us an attractive partner on the largest, most complex infrastructure projects and prestigious design-build, or DBOM (design-build-operate-maintain) or P3 (public-private partnership) projects. 
 ﻿
 In its 2017 rankings, ENR ranked us as the nation’s third largest domestic heavy contractor and fourth largest contractor in the transportation market.
 ﻿
 We believe the Civil segment provides us with significant opportunities for growth due to the age and condition of existing infrastructure coupled with large government funding sources aimed at the replacement and reconstruction of aging U.S. infrastructure and popular, often bipartisan, support from the public and elected officials for infrastructure improvement programs. Funding for major civil infrastructure projects is typically provided through a combination of one or more of the following: local, regional, state and federal loans; grants; other direct allocations sourced through tax revenue; bonds; user fees; and, for certain projects, private capital. 
 ﻿
 We have been active in civil construction since 1894 and believe we have a particular expertise in large, complex civil construction projects. We have completed or are currently working on some of the most significant civil construction projects in the United States. For example, we are currently working on various portions of the East Side Access project in New York City, the first phase of the California High-Speed Rail project, the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) project in Seattle, the Purple Line Segment 2 expansion project in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Central Subway extension to Chinatown, the platform over the eastern rail yard and the Amtrak tunnel at Hudson Yards in New York City, and the rehabilitation of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York. We have also completed projects at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the Los Angeles International Airport, the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the New Irvington Tunnel in Fremont, California, the Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore project near Oakland, California and express toll lanes along I-95 in Maryland.
 ﻿
 Building Segment
 ﻿
 Our Building segment has significant experience providing services to a number of specialized building markets for private and public works customers, including hospitality and gaming, transportation, health care, commercial offices, government facilities, sports and entertainment, education, correctional facilities, biotech, pharmaceutical, industrial and high-tech. We believe the success of the Building segment results from our proven ability to manage and perform large, complex projects with aggressive fast-track schedules; elaborate designs; and advanced mechanical, electrical and life safety systems, while providing accurate budgeting and strict quality

control. Although price is a key competitive factor, we believe our strong reputation, long-standing customer relationships and significant level of repeat and referral business have enabled us to achieve a leading position in the marketplace. 
 ﻿
 The Building segment is comprised of several operating units that provide general contracting, design-build, preconstruction and construction services in various regions of the United States. Tutor Perini Building Corp. focuses on large, complex building projects nationwide, including significant projects in the hospitality and gaming, commercial office, education, government facilities, and multi-unit residential markets. Rudolph and Sletten focuses on large, complex projects in California in the health care, commercial office, technology, industrial, education, and government facilities markets. Roy Anderson Corp. provides its services, including disaster rapid response services, to public and private customers primarily throughout the southeastern United States. Perini Management Services provides diversified construction and design-build services internationally to U.S. government agencies, as well as to surety companies and multi-national corporations. We believe that our expertise and strong résumé of notable projects positions us well to win additional large, complex building projects.
 ﻿
 In its 2017 rankings, ENR ranked us as the ninth largest domestic building contractor. We are a recognized leader in the hospitality and gaming market, specializing in the construction of high-end resorts and casinos. We work with hotel operators, Native American tribal councils, developers and architectural firms to provide diversified construction services to meet the challenges of new construction and renovation of hotel and resort properties. We believe that our reputation for completing projects on time is a significant competitive advantage in this market, as any delay in project completion could result in significant loss of revenue for the customer.
 ﻿
 We have recently completed, or are currently working on, large private and public building projects across a wide array of building end markets, including commercial offices, multi-unit residential, health care, hospitality and gaming, transportation, education, and entertainment. Specific projects include a large corporate office building in northern California for a confidential technology customer; Tower C (commercial) and Tower D (multi-unit residential) at Hudson Yards in New York City; the Washington Hospital expansion in Fremont, California; the Graton Rancheria Resort and Casino in Rohnert Park, California; the Pechanga Resort and Casino expansion in Temecula, California; the Maryland Live! Casino expansion in Hanover, Maryland; the Broadway Plaza retail development in Walnut Creek, California; Kaiser Hospital Buildings in San Leandro and Redwood City, California; and courthouses in San Bernardino and San Diego, California and Broward County, Florida. As a result of our reputation and track record, we were previously awarded and completed contracts for several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including the Resorts World New York Casino in Jamaica, New York, as well as CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan, the Wynn Encore Hotel, Trump International Hotel and Tower, Paris Las Vegas and Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas. The above projects span a wide array of building end markets and illustrate our Building segment’s résumé of successfully completed large-scale public and private projects.
 ﻿
 Specialty Contractors Segment
 ﻿
 Our Specialty Contractors segment specializes in electrical, mechanical, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection systems and pneumatically placed concrete for a full range of civil and building construction projects in the industrial, commercial, hospitality and gaming, and mass-transit end markets. This segment provides unique strengths and capabilities that position us as a full-service contractor with greater control over project bids and costs, scheduled work, project delivery and risk management.
 ﻿
 The Specialty Contractors segment is comprised of several operating units that provide unique services in various regions of the United States. Five Star Electric has established itself as an industry leader and is one of the largest electrical contractors in New York City. Five Star Electric provides construction services in the electrical sector, including power, lighting, fire alarm, security, telecommunications, low voltage and wireless systems to both the public and private sectors. These services are provided across end markets that include multi-unit residential, hotels, commercial offices, industrial, mass transit, education, retail, sports and entertainment, health care and water treatment. Fisk Electric covers many of the major commercial, transportation and industrial electrical construction markets in California and the southern United States, with the ability to cover other attractive markets nationwide. Fisk’s expertise is in technology design and the development of electrical and technology systems for major projects spanning a broad variety of project types, including commercial office buildings, sports arenas, hospitals, research laboratories, hotels and casinos, convention centers, manufacturing plants, refineries, and water and wastewater treatment facilities. WDF, Nagelbush and Desert Mechanical each provide mechanical, plumbing, HVAC and fire protection services to a range of customers in a wide variety of markets, including transportation, commercial/industrial, schools and universities and residential. WDF is one of the largest mechanical contractors servicing the New York City metropolitan region. Nagelbush operates primarily in Florida and Desert Mechanical operates primarily in the western United States. Superior Gunite specializes in pneumatically placed structural concrete utilized in infrastructure projects nationwide, such as bridges, dams, tunnels and retaining walls.
 ﻿
 In its 2017 rankings, ENR ranked us as the fifth largest electrical contractor1, twelfth largest mechanical contractor1 and tenth largest specialty contractor1 in the United States. Through Five Star Electric and WDF, collectively, we are also the largest specialty contractor in the New York City metropolitan area.

Our Specialty Contractors units have recently completed, or are currently working on, various portions of the East Side Access project in New York City, various projects at the World Trade Center and at Hudson Yards in New York City, two signal system modernization projects in New York City and electrical work for the new hospital at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. This Specialty Contractors segment has also supported, or is currently supporting, several large projects in our Civil and Building segments, including the Alaskan Way Viaduct Replacement (SR 99) project in Seattle; McCarran International Airport Terminal 3 in Las Vegas; the Resorts World New York Casino in Jamaica, New York; the Caldecott Tunnel Fourth Bore project near Oakland, California; and several marquee projects in the hospitality and gaming market, including CityCenter, the Cosmopolitan, the Wynn Encore Hotel, Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.
 ﻿
 The majority of work performed by the Specialty Contractors segment is contracted directly with state and local municipal agencies, real estate developers, general contractors, school districts and commercial and industrial customers. A smaller, but growing, component of its work is performed for our Civil and Building segments.

  ﻿
 State and Local Agencies. Our state and local government customers include state transportation departments, metropolitan authorities, cities, municipal agencies, school districts and public universities. We provide services to our state and local customers primarily pursuant to contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes. Our building construction services for state and local government customers have included judicial and correctional facilities, schools and dormitories, health care facilities, convention centers, parking structures and other municipal buildings. The vast majority of our civil contracting and building construction services are provided in locations throughout the United States and its territories.
 ﻿
 Private Owners. Our private customers include real estate developers, health care companies, technology companies, hospitality and gaming resort owners, Native American sovereign nations, public corporations and private universities. We provide services to our private customers through negotiated contract arrangements, as well as through competitive bids.
 ﻿
 Federal Agencies. Our federal government customers include the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Air Force and the National Park Service. We provide services to federal agencies primarily pursuant to contracts for specific or multi-year assignments that involve new construction or infrastructure repairs or improvements. A portion of our revenue from federal agencies is derived from projects in overseas locations, which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future as a result of our experience and strong relationships with federal agencies, together with anticipated expenditures for defense, diplomatic and security-related construction work.
 ﻿
 Most federal, state and local government contracts contain provisions that permit the termination of contracts, in whole or in part, for the convenience of the government, among other reasons.

Backlog
 ﻿
 Backlog in our industry is a measure of the total value of work that is remaining to be performed on projects that have been awarded. We include a construction project in our backlog when a contract is awarded or when we have otherwise received written definitive notice that the project has been awarded to us and there are no remaining major uncertainties that the project will proceed (e.g., we believe adequate funding is in place). As a result, we believe our backlog is firm, and although cancellations or scope adjustments may occur, historically they have not been material. Our backlog by segment, end market and customer type is presented in the following tables:

 Types of Contracts 
 ﻿
 The contracting and management services we provide consist of planning and scheduling the manpower, equipment, materials and subcontractors required for the timely completion of a project in accordance with the terms, plans and specifications contained in a construction contract. We provide these services by entering into traditional contracting arrangements as follows:
· | Fixed price or lump sum contracts are most commonly used for projects in the Civil and Specialty Contractors segments and generally commit the Company to provide all of the resources required to complete a project for a fixed sum. Usually, fixed price contracts transfer more risk to the Company, but offer the opportunity for greater profits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Guaranteed maximum price (“GMP”) contracts provide for a cost plus fee arrangement up to a maximum agreed upon price. These contracts place risks on the Company for amounts in excess of the GMP, but may permit an opportunity for greater profits than under cost plus fee contracts through sharing agreements with the owner on any cost savings that may be realized. Services provided by our Building segment to various private customers are often performed under GMP contracts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Unit price contracts are most prevalent for projects in the Civil and Specialty Contractors segments and generally commit the Company to provide an undetermined number of units or components that comprise a project at a fixed price per unit. This approach shifts the risk of estimating the quantity of units required to the project owner, but the risk of increased cost per unit is borne by the Company, unless otherwise allowed for in the contract.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost plus fee contracts are used for many projects in the Building and Specialty Contractors segments. Cost plus fee contracts include cost plus fixed fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts. Cost plus fixed fee contracts provide for reimbursement of approved project costs plus a fixed fee. Cost plus award fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the project costs plus a base fee, as well as an incentive fee based on cost and/or schedule performance. Cost plus fee contracts serve to minimize the Company’s financial risk, but may also limit profits.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Fixed price contracts account for a substantial portion of our revenue and are expected to continue to represent a sizeable percentage of both total revenue and backlog. The composition of revenue and backlog by type of contract for 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

Competition
 ﻿
 While the construction markets include numerous competitors, especially for small to mid-sized projects, much of the work that we target is for larger, more complex projects where, typically, there are fewer active market participants due to the greater capabilities and resources required to perform the work. Despite this, over the past several years we have seen increased competition, particularly from foreign competitors that have been pursuing major projects in the United States due to the relatively larger size and significant number of U.S. opportunities. We anticipate that the increased level of foreign competition will persist for the foreseeable future.
 ﻿
 In our Civil segment, we compete principally with large civil construction firms, including (alphabetically) Dragados USA; Fluor Corporation; Granite Construction; Kiewit Corporation; Skanska USA; Traylor Bros., Inc.; and The Walsh Group. In our Building segment, we compete with a variety of national and regional contractors. Our primary competitors are (alphabetically) AECOM (through its acquisitions of Tishman Construction and Hunt Construction Group); Balfour Beatty Construction; Clark Construction Group; DPR Construction; Gilbane, Inc.; Hensel Phelps Construction Co.; McCarthy Building Companies, Inc.; Skanska USA; Suffolk Construction; and Turner Construction Company. In our Specialty Contractors segment, we compete principally with various regional and local electrical, mechanical and plumbing subcontractors. We believe price, experience, reputation, responsiveness, customer relationships, project completion track record, schedule control, risk management and quality of work are key factors customers consider when awarding contracts.
 ﻿
 Construction Costs
 ﻿
 If prices for materials, labor or equipment increase excessively, provisions in certain types of contracts often shift all or a major portion of any adverse impact to the customer. In our fixed price contracts, we attempt to insulate ourselves from the unfavorable effects of inflation, when possible, by incorporating escalating wage and price assumptions into our construction cost estimates, by obtaining firm fixed price quotes from major subcontractors and material suppliers, and by entering into purchase commitments for materials early in the project schedule. Construction and other materials used in our construction activities are generally available locally from multiple sources and have been in adequate supply during recent years. Labor resources for our domestic projects are largely obtained through various labor unions. We have not experienced significant labor shortages in recent years, nor do we expect to in the near future, though a significant, rapid growth in our backlog may lead to situations in which labor resources become constrained. We employ expatriate and local labor in selected overseas areas.
 ﻿
 Environmental Matters
 ﻿
 Our properties and operations are subject to federal, state and municipal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including requirements for water discharges; air emissions; the use, management and disposal of solid or hazardous materials or wastes; and the cleanup of contamination. In certain circumstances, we may also be required to hire subcontractors to dispose of hazardous materials encountered on a project in accordance with a plan approved in advance by the owner. We continually evaluate our compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and believe that we are in substantial compliance with those laws and regulations. However, future requirements or amendments to current laws or regulations imposing more stringent requirements could require us to incur additional costs to maintain or achieve compliance.
 ﻿
 In addition, some environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal “Superfund” law and similar state statutes, can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup of contaminated sites upon any of the current or former owners or operators or upon parties who generated waste at, or sent waste to, these sites, regardless of who owned the site at the time of the release or the lawfulness of the original disposal activity. Contaminants have been detected at some of the sites that we own and where we have worked as a contractor in the past, and we have incurred costs for the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances. We believe that our liabilities for these sites are not material, either individually or in the aggregate. We have pollution liability insurance coverage for such matters, and if applicable, we seek indemnification from customers to cover the risks associated with environmental remediation.
 ﻿
 Insurance and Bonding
 ﻿
 All of our properties and equipment, as well as those of our joint ventures, are covered by insurance in amounts that we believe are consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. Our wholly owned subsidiary, PCR Insurance Company, issues policies for subcontractor default insurance, auto liability, general liability and workers’ compensation insurance, allowing us to centralize our claims and risk management functions to reduce our insurance-related costs. 
 ﻿
 As a normal part of the construction business, we are often required to provide various types of surety bonds as an additional level of security of our performance. We also require many of our higher-risk subcontractors to provide surety bonds as security for payment of subcontractors and suppliers and to guarantee their performance. As an alternative to traditional surety bonds, we also have purchased subcontractor default insurance for certain construction projects to insure against the risk of subcontractor default.

Employees
 ﻿
 The number of our employees varies based on the number of active projects, the type and magnitude of those projects, as well as our position within the lifecycle of those projects. Our total number of employees as of December 31, 2017 was 10,061. 
 ﻿
 We are signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations, as a union contractor. These agreements cover all necessary union crafts and are subject to various renewal dates. Estimated amounts for wage escalation related to the expiration of union contracts are included in our bids on various projects; accordingly, the expiration of any union contract in the next year is not expected to have any material impact on us. During the past several years, we have not experienced any significant work stoppages caused by our union employees.
