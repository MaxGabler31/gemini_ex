ITEM 1.        BUSINESS
Overview
Resonant is a late-stage development company that has created an innovative software, intellectual property, or IP, and services platform that has the ability to increase designer efficiency, reduce the time to market and lower unit costs in the designs of filters for radio frequency, or RF, front-ends for the mobile device industry.  The RF front-end, or RFFE, is the circuitry in a mobile device responsible for analog signal processing and is located between the device’s antenna and its digital circuitry.  The software platform we continue to develop is based on fundamentally new technology that we call Infinite Synthesized Networks®, or ISN®, to configure and connect resonators, the building blocks of RF filters.  Filters are a critical component of the RF front-end used to select desired radio frequency signals and reject unwanted signals.  Our ISN® platform allows us to develop unique, custom designs that address the increasing complexity of the RFFE due to increasing bandwidth requirements, such as by using carrier aggregation (the combining of multiple frequencies into a single data stream to increase throughput through higher data rates), or CA, by both reducing the size of the filter and improving performance.  Our goal is to utilize our ISN® platform to support our customers in reducing their time to develop complex filter and module designs, to access new classes of filter designs, and to do it more cost effectively. Additionally, our ISN® platform has allowed us to expand our customer focus beyond just filter manufacturers by enabling a new class of customer - fabless filter manufacturers. These companies do not have their own internal filter fabrication facility, or Fab, and typically already would be supplying other products in the RFFE to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and, as a result do not require a protracted new vendor qualification process in order to supply parts. Through our existing customer relationships, we are able to leverage our ISN® tools to deliver cutting edge filter designs to these fabless filter manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2018, we deployed the first-ever module of our ISN® tool for evaluation, the PMTx®, designed to significantly improve design and fabrication turn times by improving fabrication process control.
We are commercializing our technology through the creation of filter designs that address the problems in the high growth RFFE industry created by the growing number of frequency bands in mobile devices. The worldwide adoption of Long Term Evolution, or LTE, as the global standard, and the use of mobile devices to access the Internet, has resulted in massive proliferation of frequency bands which, when combined with CA for higher data rates and multiple input multiple output, or MIMO, has resulted in an ever-increasing number and complexity of filters in the RFFE. We have developed and continue to expand a series of single-band designs for frequency bands presently dominated by larger and more expensive bulk acoustic wave, or BAW, filters.  We are also developing multiplexer filter designs for two or more bands to address the CA requirements of our customers. We are using our ISN® platform to efficiently integrate these designs into RF modules for our module customers. Finally, we are developing unique filter designs, enabled by ISN®, to replace multiple filters and associated componentry for many bands, with higher performance. Currently, we are leveraging ISN® to develop these designs targeted for either the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) or Temperature Compensated, Surface Acoustic Wave (TC-SAW) manufacturing processes. In 2018 we further extended ISN® for BAW designs, which has resulted in our invention of a unique resonator structure that we call XBARTM, which exhibits performance parameters suitable for 5G applications - high frequency operation, large bandwidth and high power reliability. Our success with XBARTM is dependent on our ability to develop high frequency filters utilizing these resonator structures that are successfully adopted by our targeted customers, which will be determined by our ability to show improved performance over competing products or significantly reduce the size and cost of their products. 
We believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of validating our ISN® platform and related IP libraries to address this rapidly growing market.  Our target customers make part or all of the RFFE.  We intend to retain ownership of our designs, and we expect to be compensated through license fees and royalties based on sales of RFFE filters that incorporate our designs and leverage our ISN® platform. 
 Our typical customer engagement process begins with the execution of a Joint Development Agreement, or JDA, and License Agreement, or LA, for specific bands. Depending on the complexity of the design, we estimate that initial samples of products to OEMs, will occur typically within nine to thirty-six months following execution of a license agreement. We classify these new designs as either ISN® Ready (9-12 months), ISN® Pilot (12-18 months), ISN® Advanced (18-36 months) or ISN® Development (Custom). Following these development cycles, designs are manufactured, qualified by our customers and sampled to OEM customers. Our customers can take from three to six months to qualify a design and then the OEMs can take an additional three to six months, or longer, to qualify a design as fit for use, reliable and ready for mass production. The point at which an OEM begins taking product from our customers in mass production is typically when royalty revenues would begin. Our customer agreements typically provide for upfront design fees and royalty payments for each unit sold using our filter designs and typically last for a minimum of two years, but may be renewed for a longer period.

We began 2016 with no customers under contract and no license agreements and we ended the year with six customers and more than 25 designs contracted. These included a wide range of complex designs ranging from sophisticated "WiFi Co-existence" filters to high frequency duplexers and quadplexers. In late 2016, we expanded our customer focus beyond filter manufacturers operating their own Fab to include fabless filter manufacturers. 
During 2017, we continued to expand our engagements with existing customers while identifying and contracting with new customers and ended the year with a total of eight customers and more than double the number of designs contracted. In many cases the expansion in the number of contracted designs came from customers who already had a significant investment in working with Resonant and confidence in the capabilities of the ISN® platform, IP and design team. 
Also, in 2017, in order to further facilitate our fabless filter program, and to provide manufacturing stability across the supply chain, we embarked on the creation of our ISN® Foundry Program. Foundries joining Resonant’s program first complete a foundry evaluation process to ensure alignment with our customers for filter performance, manufacturing quality and capacity, and business practices.  Once the evaluation is completed, the foundry runs a characterization lot, used to create a foundry process design kit, after which we are ready to start designs for manufacture in the foundry.  Packaging/Back-end vendors can also join the program by completing a back-end evaluation process to match their capabilities with foundry partners and our customers. Through this program we enable a secure supply chain for all our customers.
In 2018, we hired a vice president of software development to continue the expansion and conversion of our ISN® platform for cloud-based delivery. Improving design efficiency with software development and enhancement to our ISN® platform and related modules is a top priority to maximize the effectiveness of our engineers. In addition, we hired a vice president of business operations to implement scalable business processes to improve efficiency while we grow operations.  Further in 2018, we continued the development of our phone-board testing and reliability capabilities, in order to support our customers with proficiencies critical for their success. We finished 2018 with 11 customers and over 70 designs contracted to date. 
We plan to continue to pursue filter design projects with existing and potential customers and other strategic partners. These types of arrangements may subsidize the expansion of our IP libraries and further the development of our ISN® platform, as well as offer complementary technology and market intelligence. We are also investigating the potential of licensing part or all of our ISN® software design suite to potential customers in the RFFE industry. However, we intend to retain ownership of our technology, software, designs and related improvements. Our goal is to establish and leverage alliances with new and existing customers, who will help grow the market for our designs by integrating them with their own proprietary technology and products, or by using our software products for their own designs, thus combining their own particular strengths with ours to provide an extensive array of solutions.

The Mobile Internet
 The need for duplexers and other filters in the RFFE of mobile devices continues to grow rapidly due to rising consumer demand for always-on wireless broadband. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are quickly becoming the primary means of accessing the internet. According to Cisco, worldwide mobile data traffic grew 71% in 2017 and will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 46% from 2018 to 2022. Cisco also predicted that smartphones will surpass 90 percent of mobile data traffic by 2022.
The exponential growth in mobile data traffic is testing the limits of existing wireless bandwidth. Carriers and regulators have responded by opening new RF spectrum, driving up the number of frequency bands in mobile devices, and thus pushing mobile phone designers to make more efficient use of spectrum. 
According to Yole Development, the market for RFFE filters in mobile devices was 40.3 billion filters in 2017 and will grow to an estimated 104.5 billion filters by 2020.

In addition to RFFE filter unit growth, filter sales growth is expected to follow and is estimated to be $7.2 billion in 2017 and is forecasted to reach $20.2 billion by 2022, according to Yole. By 2025 Yole estimates that filters will represent 70% of the RFFE component market.

 Adding RF spectrum to increase capacity and data-rate is not a complete solution. The added spectrum for 4G does not come in large contiguous blocks, but rather in small channels or bands of varying size and frequency. Thus, more data means more bands, and the result is a rapid and substantial increase in the number of bands in mobile devices. 5G introduces new challenges for filter performance and complexity, by adding much larger blocks of spectrum at higher frequencies (above 3GHz).
Challenges Faced by the Mobile Device Industry
The world is progressing toward ubiquitous RF coverage in which almost all devices will be connected, most wirelessly. Technology experts predict that by 2021 there will be over 26 billion connected devices operating worldwide and we will be measuring mobile usage in Exabytes. This overwhelming demand for wireless data has driven the carriers and regulators to open new spectrum bands.
This substantial and rapid increase in bands has created several significant problems, including a corresponding increase in the number of filters and duplexers in mobile devices. Traditional RF front-end solutions typically require one duplexer for each frequency band. The most recent iPhones support coverage for 19 FDD-LTE and 5 TDD-LTE bands, in addition to support for previous wireless technology generations, 3G and 2G, with each band requiring a filter, either as an individual filter, a duplexer or a quadplexer, depending upon the spectrum and CA requirements. This increase in number and complexity of filters is dramatically driving up the cost of RF front-ends. In the latest global smartphones, filters and duplexers comprise more than half of the cost to the RF front-end, according to a Barclays' analysis. The dramatic increase in the number of filters required, which includes Chip Scale Package, or CSP, Wafer Level Package, or WLP, filters, duplexers, quadplexers, with multiple sizes and multiple packaging substrates, each requiring a new design, requires an increase in design capacity, or improved design efficiency. ISN® improves the design efficiency by accurately modeling the performance of acoustic wave filters.
The growing number of filters is also increasing the total size of the RF front-end. In some cases, size constraints require the OEM to fragment its product offering into multiple versions, each with a limited set of filters customized for a particular geographic region. Multiple versions of a mobile product increases manufacturing, inventory and distribution costs. In addition, consumers can find it difficult to roam between carriers and/or countries due to this splintering of bands and phone 
8

models. Phone OEMs would prefer to make one version of a product containing a full set of filters that can be electronically selected as required for a particular carrier network.
In addition, the new, higher frequency 4G bands tend to use relatively expensive BAW technology. Phone OEMs would prefer to use SAW technology because of its lower cost and smaller size. However, conventional filter designs using SAW technology do not perform adequately in high frequency bands or in bands with closely spaced receive and transmit channels, typical of many new bands.
Adding to the complexity of the industry, mobile devices must now be capable of receiving from two, to as many as five, downlink bands simultaneously, known as downlink CA. This CA requirement creates the need for complex multiplexing filters, or multiplexers, which are significantly more complex than duplexers and effectively require four filters for each CA combination. There will be an estimated 200 worldwide combinations of CA cases, creating increased complexity and cost to RFFEs. In the case of a quadplexer, with four different frequency bands, within each band the signal loss must be minimized, while rejecting three bands often in close proximity. Duplexers must only reject a single band. Mobile Experts predicts that more than 28 billion RFFEs will be shipped supporting CA in 2022. This rising complexity in the industry is also exacerbating the constraints on design capacity and resources.

In addition to the challenges described above, 5G will further exacerbate the problems of more demand for filters, filter designs, and more complexity and integration in the RFFE. 5G comprises three distinct segments:

• | Enhanced mobile broadband: Increased bandwidth for extreme data-rates and capacity to support wireless video everywhere; 


• | Mission critical services: High reliability, low latency and high security for automotive, health and government; and

9


• | Massive Internet of Things: Low cost, low energy, long life for wearables, smart home devices and interconnected devices

All three of these segments require filters and will further accelerate the already substantial growth in the filter market. 
Our Technology
RFFE module companies currently produce filters internally or purchase filters from third-party manufacturers, such as Broadcom, Murata and RF360. These module companies and filter manufacturers design filters using their own internal resources, which we believe are proving insufficient to meet the explosive growth in both total global filter demand and unique filter designs, as well as the increasingly complex filter requirements necessitated in part by crowded spectrum and carrier aggregation. We believe that our patented ISN® technology will enable us to design complex filter products at approximately half the unit cost and in approximately half the time of traditional approaches. ISN® can be summarized as a three-step process:
We synthesize RF acoustic devices. We have developed a large suite of proprietary mathematical methods and software tools that allow us to find better solutions because we can explore a much larger set of possible solutions.  Our ISN® tools and methods draw upon a century of network synthesis techniques.  In other words, rather than rely on a single design solution (the acoustic wave ladder that is used almost solely in this industry to date), we generate, or synthesize, large numbers of unique solutions specifically for each set of requirements. This allows us to create filters using existing manufacturing methods, such as SAW manufacturing methods, that perform as well as those using the higher cost methods of BAWs. These synthesized solutions provide a framework for generating circuit models for optimization.
We use circuit models to optimize initial designs.  Most of this industry models acoustic wave filters using a coupling-of-modes, or COM, model. In contrast, we use circuit models derived from the actual physics of acoustic wave filters. Circuit models are computationally much faster, which allows for very quick optimization of the many possible solutions that result from the synthesis process. We can quickly compare large numbers of different, optimized solutions before commencing the third step - lengthy but highly accurate simulations based on fundamental methods.
We use fundamental models to simulate final designs. Our highly accurate models are based entirely on fundamental material properties and dimensions, again unlike the common practice in this industry today.  The precision and accuracy of our models allows for far fewer turns through the fab to reach the desired product performance.  Because our models are fundamental, integration with our foundry and fab customers is eased due to the understanding of the basic material properties and dimensions of the fab.
Our Commercialization Plan
We will continue to pursue filter design projects with existing and potential customers and other strategic partners, and we believe licensing our designs is the most direct and effective means of delivering our solutions to the market and validating the technical advantages of our tools, IP and team. We intend to retain ownership of our technology, designs and related improvements and charge royalties based on sales of filters that incorporate our designs. We do not intend to manufacture or sell any physical products or operate as a contract design company developing designs for a fee. Our strategy is to establish and leverage alliances with customers, who will help grow the market for our designs by integrating them with their own proprietary technology and products, thus combining their own particular strengths with ours to provide an extensive array of solutions and to develop and license filter designs that offer improvements in the time to develop, cost, size and performance of RFFEs. The goal for our designs is to improve profit margins and increase market share for our customers.
Our customers are filter manufacturers, RFFE module manufacturers, RF active and passive component suppliers and potentially mobile handset OEMs. Currently, for most of our customers, we license specific, custom designs. In the fourth quarter of 2018 we introduced and announced the first customer for our standard IP filter library of products. In these cases we develop a standard design at one of our qualified foundries and customers can then license this design without paying for or waiting for completion of development, hence minimizing their cost and reducing time to market. We charge royalties at a fixed amount per filter or as a percentage of sales price. We expect to generate substantially all of our near-term revenues with these types of licensing arrangements. Each filter design and related royalty stream is expected to have a finite commercial life as mobile devices continue to evolve. Our plan is to offer our customers replacement designs as existing designs become obsolete.
We anticipate that once a development and license agreement is signed and design begins, there could be 12 to 36 months before the start of royalty payments under a particular license, depending on the complexity and scope of the engagement. 
10

Our products will be designed for manufacture with existing high-volume fabrication processes allowing rapid time to market, but we do not plan to manufacture or sell any physical components. Unlike a manufacturing company, we intend to create designs for manufacturers, eliminating for us the costs and problems associated with manufacturing and inventory. This allows us to concentrate on our unique expertise, leaving the hardware manufacturers to drive their own economies of scale.
Single Band Designs
We continue to develop a series of SAW filter designs for RF frequency bands presently dominated by the larger and more expensive BAW filters. In 2018, we continued to develop single band, SAW filter designs for customers. Some of these filter designs are for duplexers that have historically been TC-SAWs or BAWs while others are for discrete SAW filters that may need improvements in performance, size or cost. The single band designs included WiFi Co-Existence filters, which pass licensed wireless frequencies, while protecting WiFi from interference, and designs for module applications which require wafer-level (WL) packaging and modeling of the module board. We believe that, using our ISN® technology, combined with our experience and know-how, we can design innovative SAW filters that meet the performance requirements for many of these bands but at significantly less cost than that of BAW filters they would replace.  These single band filter designs are the earliest opportunity for royalty revenues, and represented the nominal royalty revenues in 2018. In 2018, we continued to develop single band designs using TC-SAW processes in order to take advantage of the improved temperature stability.
Multiplexer Designs
Wireless carriers worldwide are experiencing increasing demand for higher data speeds. CA allows multiple data streams from different frequencies to be added together to provide increased data rate for the mobile users. However, CA further complicates the required filter characteristics. Quadplexers, (4-RF path multiplexer) as described above, enable CA on both receive and transmit paths and reduce the RFFE complexity by reducing the number of switches, but the complexity of the filters themselves increases dramatically. During 2018, we expanded our capability to optimize the performance of quadplexers on OEM phone-boards in order to help our customers demonstrate "real world" performance. We believe that our ISN® technology is ideally suited to these difficult filter design problems that cover a wide frequency range with much more demanding performance requirements.
Although some band combinations for aggregation will not require multiplexers, we believe that multiplexers are the best solution for bands in close frequency proximity. We are developing high performance multiplexer designs to address this growing market.
Advance Developments
We believe that our ISN® technology will also enable us to design novel filters that are more than simple replacements to existing slots, but rather can enable an architecture change, or can provide a step function improvement in performance, size and cost to a handset manufacturer. These include:

• | High frequency, wide bandwidth filters for 5G - large instantaneous bandwidth filters at high frequency (above 3GHz) are required for 5G to support high data-rates. Filters using XBARTM resonators will be ideally suited for these applications


• | Triplexers/Multiplexers - wideband, low loss multiplexed filters which allow efficient sharing of antennas. As more spectrum becomes available above 2.5GHz the focus will be in minimizing the losses at the higher frequency.


• | Multi-passband Filters - small size, low loss filters to maximize printed circuit board space and minimize loss, particularly suited for CA applications. The absence of switching elements further reduces size and cost for CA.

Our immediate focus is to address the problems in the RFFE with innovative single-band and multiplex designs made possible with our ISN® technology. These designs present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization of our ISN® technology. We expect the trend towards spectrum proliferation, in addition to CA and MIMO, will require complex filter multiplexing. Compounding the demands described above, large bandwidth filters for 5G will further increase the complexity. We believe our ISN® technology will enable cost effective designs for these applications. 
We also believe that the power of Resonant ISN® tools and methodology will continue to enable fabless customers and filter foundries to newly enter or expand their participation in the supply chain for RF filters. In late 2016, we expanded our customer focus to include fabless filter manufacturers, which are companies that do not have their own internal filter fabrication facility. Typically, these companies already are supplying other products in the RFFE to the OEM, and as a result, do not require a protracted new vendor qualification process in order to supply parts. In 2017, to further facilitate our fabless filter 
11

program and to provide manufacturing stability across the supply chain to our fully integrated filter customers, we created our ISN® Foundry Program. Foundries joining the ISN® Foundry Program first complete a foundry evaluation process to ensure alignment with our customers for filter performance, manufacturing quality and capacity, and business practices.  Once the evaluation is completed, the foundry runs a characterization lot, used to create a foundry process design kit, after which we are ready to start designs for manufacture in the foundry.  Packaging/Back-end vendors also can join the program by completing a back-end evaluation process to match their capabilities with foundry partners and our customers. It is through this program that we can enable a secure supply chain for all our customers.
Intellectual Property
We have an active program protecting our proprietary technology. In protecting our technology, we make use of patent protection, trade secret protection, trademark protection, mask works and copyright protection. To maximize these protections, we maintain active intellectual property development and protection programs, including with respect to patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and mask works.
Our patent portfolio reflects both the initial technology originated at and contributed to us by Superconductor Technologies Inc., or STI, as well as our own patent filings since our founding, and continues to be the result of an active and ongoing program to identify, protect and commercialize our intellectual property. This program includes the development of a comprehensive patent strategy. We engage in a thorough process of patent landscaping that provides an in-depth analysis of not only the markets we are addressing, but also adjacent markets, so that we can tactically and strategically protect our position in the market through patent filings. We also routinely use specialized outside firms to assist in these endeavors. These firms assist with invention identification, intellectual property strategy and competitive landscape analysis. Through our landscaping and advanced product development processes we have plans to file additional patents in 2019.
Our patent portfolio comprises more than 165 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents. This patent portfolio relates primarily to the following subject matters:
•Physical Implementation 
•Semiconductor materials and processes
•Resonator and filter designs
•Design Synthesis and Optimization Speed
•Network Synthesis
•Image Design
•Circuit Designs
•Simulation Accuracy
•Next Generation Designs/Architectures    
•Simplifying the RFFE
•Circuit Structure
•Critical Design Requirements
•Power handling and linearity 
•Temperature dependence
•Yield Analysis
We have a formal trade secret program to identify and protect technologies and know-how that derive significant economic value from being secret. This program is managed to provide the optimal levels of protection and competitive advantage to us. We protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information by maintaining the secrecy of such information, including by requiring confidentiality agreements from all our employees, consultants and third parties having access to such information. We have a number of trade secrets already protected in this program and we expect to add more such trade secrets into the program in 2019.
We have also registered U.S. trademarks for ‘‘Resonant®’’, ‘‘ISN®”, “Infinite Synthesized Networks®’’ and PMTx®.
There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications or any future patent applications will be approved or will not be challenged successfully by third parties, that any issued patents will protect our technology or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that have been or may be issued to us.
Despite our efforts to maintain the secrecy of our trade secrets, there also can be no assurance that others will not gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can meaningfully protect our technology. Nor can there be assurances that we will 
12

succeed in enforcing our trade secrets in the event others improperly gain access to them. In addition, effective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.
Competition
To our knowledge, we have no direct competitors in the electronic design automation or licensing business that are exclusively focused on RFFEs. We have spent many years developing ISN®, and our own patented suite of design tools created specifically for this purpose. No comparable acoustic wave filter design tool exists in the market today to our knowledge. In combination with our experienced design team, we believe we offer our customers a novel solution to the need for increasingly complex filter designs developed by an independent, stand-alone company that is not presently offered by any other company.
We have advantages that we believe present significant barriers to entry for potential competitors that desire to replicate our business model:
•a large and growing portfolio of patents and trade secrets;
•a suite of proprietary software design tools;
•a growing number of customers;
•a highly experienced design team; and
•a multi-year technology lead. 
We do compete with the existing filter designs and design capabilities of the design teams at our customers and target customers and their filter manufacturers. We must demonstrate to our customers, target customers and their filter manufacturers, that switching to our designs will give them a competitive advantage by providing market entry or sufficiently improving the cost, size, and performance of their current products to justify our royalty rates.
The use of our patented ISN® tools, not only enables lower cost and smaller size SAW solutions for single band and multiplexer designs but also enables development of creative filter solutions for next generation RFFE architectures that, if successful will offer new, highly competitive solutions to many of the challenges facing the manufacturers of RFFE modules.
Employees
We currently have 70 employees, 50 of which are on our technical staff and 20 of which are devoted to finance, sales, marketing and administration matters.  We also use several outside consultants.
Our principal executive offices are located at 175 Cremona Drive, Suite 200, Goleta, California 93117, and our telephone number is 805-308-9803.
