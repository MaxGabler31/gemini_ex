Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Electromed, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Electromed” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative products that provide airway clearance therapy, including the SmartVest® Airway Clearance System (“SmartVest System”) and related products, to patients with compromised pulmonary function with a commitment to excellence and compassionate service. Our goal is to make High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (“HFCWO”) treatments as effective, convenient, and comfortable as possible, so our patients can breathe easier and live better with improved respiratory function and fewer exacerbations.
 
We employ a direct-to-patient and provider model, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims on behalf of our patients, and deliver the SmartVest System to patients, training them on proper use in their homes. This model allows us to directly approach patients and clinicians, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical equipment (“DME”) channel and capture both the manufacturer and distributor margins. We also sell our products in the acute care setting for patients in a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were admitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance. Electromed was incorporated in Minnesota in 1992. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “ELMD.”
 
The SmartVest System features a programmable air pulse generator, a therapy garment worn over the upper body and a connecting hose, which together provide safe, comfortable, and effective airway clearance therapy. The SmartVest System generates HFCWO, an airway clearance therapy. One factor of respiratory health is the ability to clear secretions from airways. Impaired airway clearance, when mucus cannot be expectorated, may result in labored breathing and/or inflammatory and immune systems boosting mucus production that invites bacteria trapped in stagnant secretions to cause infections. Studies show that HFCWO therapy is as effective an airway clearance method for patients who have compromised pulmonary function as traditional chest physical therapy (“CPT”) administered by a respiratory therapist.1 However, HFCWO can be self-administered, relieving a caregiver of participation in the therapy, and eliminating the attendant cost of an in-home care provider. We believe that HFCWO treatments are cost-effective primarily because they reduce a patient’s risk of respiratory infections and other secondary complications that are associated with impaired airway clearance and often result in costly hospital visits and repeated antibiotic use.
 
The SmartVest System is designed for patient comfort and ease of use which promotes adherence to prescribed treatment schedules, leading to improved airway clearance, patient outcomes and quality of life, and a reduction in healthcare utilization. We offer a broad range of garments, referred to as vests and wraps, in sizes for children and adults that allow for tailored fit. User-friendly controls allow patients to administer their daily therapy with minimal or no assistance. Our direct product support services provide patient and clinician education, training, and follow-up to ensure that the product is integrated into each patient’s daily treatment regimen. Additionally, our reimbursement department assures we are working on behalf of the patient by processing their physician paperwork, providing clinical support and billing the applicable insurance provider. We believe that the advantages of the SmartVest System and the Company’s customer services to the patient include:
 

● | improved quality of life; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduction in healthcare utilization; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | independence from a dedicated caregiver; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consistent treatments at home; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improved comfort during therapy; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | eligibility for reimbursement by private insurance, federal or state government programs or combinations of the foregoing.

Our Products 
 
Since 2000, we have marketed the SmartVest System and its predecessor products to patients suffering from bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). Our products are sold into the home health care market and the acute care setting for patients in a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were admitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance. Accordingly, our sales points of contact include adult pulmonology clinics, cystic fibrosis centers, neuromuscular clinics and hospitals.
 
We have received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market the SmartVest System to promote airway clearance and improve bronchial drainage. In addition, Electromed is certified to apply the Conformité Européenne (“European Conformity” or “CE”) marking for HFCWO device sales in all European Union member countries and approved for HFCWO device sales in other, select international countries. The SmartVest System is available only with a physician’s prescription.
 
The SmartVest System is currently available in one model – SQL® – which is sold into home care and hospital markets. We will continue to support and service earlier SmartVest models pursuant to the applicable product warranty.
 
As part of our growth strategies, we periodically evaluate opportunities involving products and services, especially those that may provide value to the respiratory homecare and institutional market. To that end, we made meaningful progress in the development of our next generation SmartVest System during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) and estimate launching such device and completing the corresponding FDA 510(k) clearance process in the first half of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”).
 
The SmartVest SQL System
 
The SmartVest SQL System consists of an inflatable therapy garment, a programmable air pulse generator and a patented single-hose that delivers air pulses from the generator to the garment. The SmartVest SQL is designed for maximum comfort and lifestyle convenience, so patients can readily fit therapy into their daily routines. The SmartVest SQL was designed to be significantly smaller, quieter, and lighter than its predecessor, and offers features that make it easier to use and enable greater patient freedom.
 

● | Patented single-hose design: A single-hose delivers oscillations to the SmartVest garment, which we believe provides therapy in a more comfortable and unobtrusive manner than a two-hose system. Oscillations are delivered evenly from the base of the SmartVest garment, extending the forces upward and inward in strong but smooth cycles surrounding the chest. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Open system design with active inflate – active deflate: The active inflate – active deflate mechanism of the SmartVest System provides patients a more comfortable treatment experience by allowing them to take deep breaths and breathe more easily without feeling restricted. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Soft-fabric garment is lightweight and comfortable: The SmartVest garment is lightweight and designed to resemble an article of clothing. Quick fit Velcro®-like closures allow for a secure, comfortable fit without bulky straps and buckles. The simple design creates a broad size adjustment range to ensure a properly tailored fit to accommodate pediatric and adult patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patented Soft Start® and 360° garment oscillation coverage: Soft Start gently fills the garment to acclimate the patient to therapy. All SmartVest garments provide 360° oscillation coverage, which delivers simultaneous treatment to all lobes of the lungs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller, quieter and lighter: The SmartVest SQL System is 25% smaller, 5db quieter and 30% lighter than the prior SmartVest SV2100 System, which we previously discontinued on July 1, 2021. The SmartVest SQL is the lightest and overall quietest HFCWO generator on the market, weighing less than 16 pounds, making it easier for patients to use and integrate HFCWO therapy into their daily lives. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Programmable generator with user-friendly device operation: The SmartVest SQL features multiple operating modes, including ramp, and options for saving, locking and restoring protocols. Further, an enhanced pause feature allows the physician to program dedicated times for the patient to clear secretions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
SmartVest Connect 
 
In June 2017, we launched the SmartVest SQL with SmartVest Connect® wireless technology, a personalized HFCWO therapy management portal for patients with compromised pulmonary function. In March 2020, we launched the SmartVest Connect app for both the iOS and Android operating systems. The SmartVest Connect app securely connects to the SmartVest SQL System through Bluetooth™ technology. This interface allows patients and healthcare teams to track therapy in real-time and collaborate on care decisions to improve therapy adherence and patient outcomes. SmartVest Connect is available to pediatric and cystic fibrosis patients, and targeted adult pulmonary clinics using a Bluetooth-enabled SmartVest SQL System.
 
Other Products
 
We market the Single Patient Use (“SPU”) SmartVest and SmartVest Wrap® to health care providers in the acute care setting. Hospitals issue the SPU SmartVest or SmartVest Wrap to an individual patient for managing airway clearance. Both SPU products provide full coverage oscillation and facilitate continuity of care because they introduce the patient to our product and may encourage use of the SmartVest System for home care, which can be provided to patients with a chronic condition upon discharge.
Our Market
 
We estimate the total served U.S. market for HFCWO has returned to pre-pandemic levels and is estimated at approximately $220 million to $240 million, with growth in HFCWO adoption at approximately 5% based on independent third-party market research. We believe the market for HFCWO is continuing to expand due to an aging population, higher incidence of chronic lung disease, growing awareness by physicians of diseases and conditions for which patients can benefit from using HFCWO therapy, and treatments moving to lower cost home care settings. Indications for when HFCWO may be prescribed are not specific to any one disease. A physician may elect to prescribe HFCWO when such individual believes the patient will benefit from improved airway clearance and external chest manipulation is the treatment of choice to enhance mucus transport and improve bronchial drainage. 
 
The SmartVest System is primarily prescribed for patients with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy and ALS. We believe that bronchiectasis represents the fastest growing diagnostic category and greatest potential for HFCWO growth in the United States exhibiting an 8.7% increase in patients diagnosed between 2000 and 20079. Bronchiectasis is an irreversible, chronic lung condition characterized by enlarged and permanently damaged bronchi. The condition is associated with recurrent lower respiratory infections, inflammation, reduction in pulmonary function, impaired respiratory secretion clearance, increased hospitalizations and medication use, and increased morbidity and mortality.
 
We are driven to make life's important moments possible, one breath at a time, by leading the HFCWO therapy market in clinical evidence that supports the therapeutic imperative of clearing excess mucus from the lungs. Electromed continues to add to the body of evidence in support of HFCWO with multiple published clinical outcome studies demonstrating a significant improvement in quality of life and reduction in exacerbation rates, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and antibiotic prescriptions in bronchiectasis patients using the SmartVest System. This includes the most recent clinical study, a 2022 publication in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine reviewing outcomes among non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients with HFCWO Therapy.2-6 Generating additional clinical evidence to further support the SmartVest System as a preferred treatment for bronchiectasis patients will remain a focus for us in fiscal 2023, with two clinical studies in progress. The first such clinical study is a prospective, multi-center bronchiectasis outcomes study utilizing SmartVest therapy, and the second is a post surveillance study with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") and bronchiectasis patients prescribed SmartVest utilizing quality of life questionnaires to measure outcomes prior to therapy and at two intervals following initiation of the therapy.
 
We believe that bronchiectasis is under recognized and underdiagnosed but is experiencing a surge in clinical interest and awareness, including the relationship to COPD, commonly referred to as bronchiectasis COPD overlap syndrome. The overlap of bronchiectasis and COPD increases exacerbations and hospitalizations, reduces pulmonary function, and increases mortality. Several recent studies have estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis, which we believe are helpful for estimating a range of the overall market size.

● | Weycker (2017) projected 4.2 million adults in the United States over the age of 40 may have bronchiectasis, suggesting there is a large pool of patients with undiagnosed disease.7 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Henkle (2018) confirmed a high prevalence of bronchiectasis in the United States, identifying over 600,000 unique patients with at least one bronchiectasis claim (ICD-9 claims 494.0 or 494.1). The study also observed that patients with dual diagnosis of bronchiectasis and COPD were in poorer health, with more office visits, more inpatient admissions and more acute respiratory infections.8 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seitz (2012) estimated that 190,000 unique cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed in Medicare patients in 2007 and bronchiectasis prevalence increased 8.7% annually between 2000 and 2007.9 Based on historic growth in prevalence and assuming a constant growth rate, the estimated number of bronchiectasis diagnoses in Medicare patients in 2021 exceeded 608,000. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aksamit (2017) found 20% (n=350) of patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the U.S. Bronchiectasis Research Registry between 2008 and 2014 also had COPD and 29% (n=515) also had asthma.7 Other studies have found that the overlap between bronchiectasis and COPD is observed in 27% to 57% of patients with COPD. 10-13–8 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chalmers (2017) found that prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD ranged from a low of 4% to as high as 69% with mean prevalence of 54%. In many studies in patients with COPD, the presence of bronchiectasis was associated with reduced lung function, greater sputum production, more frequent exacerbations and increased mortality versus those with COPD alone.14 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These studies indicate a wide range of potential prevalence of bronchiectasis patients in the United States. We also believe that it is difficult to estimate from these studies which patients will need or benefit from HFCWO. Internal company estimates derived from 2020 analysis of the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database, one of the largest US health plan databases of adjudicated integrated medical and pharmacy claims, indicate a 15% to 20% penetration of HFCWO within the diagnosed Bronchiectasis population15. By conservatively assessing the market size in relation to the clinical studies cited above, we calculate that current HFCWO adoption may account for only 90,000 patients of the 500 to 600 thousand currently diagnosed and treatable patients (see Figure 1 below). We believe that bronchiectasis is underdiagnosed in the U.S. based on clinical study and epidemiology evidence with an even greater number of patients that could potentially benefit from diagnosis and treatment. We believe that HFCWO is under prescribed for bronchiectasis patients resulting in a large, underpenetrated US market opportunity and growth potential for HFCWO therapy.

Estimated HFCWO Market Opportunity - Bronchiectasis Patients (U.S.) – Figure 1
 


The heightened awareness of bronchiectasis speaks to the growing body of clinical evidence supporting treatments to improve symptoms and manage disease progression.
 

● | In 2019, an observational comparative retrospective cohort study published in BMC Pulmonary Medicine evaluated the efficacy of a treatment algorithm in 65 patients with radiographic and symptom confirmed bronchiectasis, centered on initiation of HFCWO therapy with the SmartVest System.5 Patients were treated per the algorithm if they reported greater than two exacerbations in the previous year and symptoms, including chronic cough, sputum production, or dyspnea. Results show that at one-year: exacerbations requiring hospitalization and antibiotic use were significantly reduced and mean forced expiratory volume remained stable post enrollment, suggesting early initiation of HFCWO therapy may slow the otherwise normal progression of the disease.

● | In 2022, the American Journal of Respiratory and Crucial Care Medicine published the results of a third-party retrospective cohort analysis of 101 qualifying NCFBE patients who received HFCWO. Key findings revealed that patients who used HFCWO therapy experienced improved health outcomes, a reduction in healthcare resource utilization and reduction in medication usage.6

Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on driving adoption of our products and services with physicians, clinicians, patients, and third-party payers and building market awareness to the benefits of HFCWO for treatment of bronchiectasis. Because the sale of the SmartVest System requires a physician's prescription, we market to physicians and health care providers as well as directly to patients. The majority of our revenue comes from domestic home care sales through a physician referral model. We have established our own domestic sales force and support network, which we believe is able to provide superior education, support and training to our customers. 
 
5

 

Our direct U.S. sales force works with physicians and clinicians, primarily pulmonologists, in defined territories to help them understand our products and services and the value they provide to their respective patients. As of June 30, 2022, we had 52 field sales employees, including six regional sales managers, 43 clinical area managers (“CAMs”) and three clinical educators. We also have developed a network of approximately 250 respiratory therapists and health care professionals across the U.S. to assist with in-home SmartVest System patient training on a non-exclusive, independent contractor basis. These independent contractors are credentialed by the National Board for Respiratory Care as either Certified Respiratory Therapists or Registered Respiratory Therapists and provide national coverage to an internal team of Registered Respiratory Therapists dedicated to supporting SmartVest patients. Additionally, Electromed employs a team of reimbursement specialists dedicated to managing insurance and payer relations and supporting prescribers and patients in navigating financial considerations. The availability of reimbursement is an important consideration for health care professionals and patients. Because our product has an assigned Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) code, a claim can be billed for reimbursement using that code. We must demonstrate the effectiveness of our products to public and private insurance providers. The availability of reimbursement exists primarily due to an established HCPCS code for HFCWO. A HCPCS code is assigned to services and products by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”).
 

● | Of the $41.7 million of our revenue derived from the U.S. in fiscal 2022, approximately 91% represented home care and 4% represented hospital sales. We expect to achieve future sales, earnings, and overall market share growth through a continued focus on product innovation, differentiation and improved patient experiences and outcomes in the home care segment. We believe that our position in the market, direct sales team and a dedication to advancing education on HFCWO awareness positions us to drive market awareness and growth to the benefits of HFCWO in treatment of bronchiectasis. We believe that dedicated service to our providers and patients is a key component of achieving future sales. Providers seek companies that are easy to work with, are responsive and care for their patients as an extension of their practices. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We generate sales interest through multiple channels that include visits to pulmonology clinics and medical centers, participation in medical conferences, maintenance of industry contacts to increase the visibility and acceptance of our products by physicians and health care professionals, participation with patient organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as well as through a focus on increasing patients by word of mouth and traffic to our website and social media channels. We continue to evaluate opportunities to offer the SmartVest System through selected Home Medical Equipment (“HME”) distributors. We maintain agreements with three HME distributors, one national and two regional, to distribute and sell the SmartVest System in the United States home care market. We expect to continue our direct sales channel as our primary homecare revenue source.
 
International Marketing 
 
Approximately 1.3% and 1.8% of our net revenues were from sales outside of the U.S. in our fiscal 2022 and our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”), respectively. We sell our products outside of the U.S. primarily through independent distributors specializing in respiratory products. Through June 30, 2022, the majority of our distributors operated in exclusive territories. Our principal distributors are located in Europe, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia, South America and Central America. Units are sold at a fixed contract price with payments made directly from the distributor, rather than being tied to reimbursement rates of a patient’s insurance provider as is the case for domestic sales. Our sales strategy outside of the U.S. is to maintain our current distributors with less emphasis on contracting with new distributors.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the U.S., individuals who use the SmartVest System generally rely on third-party payers, including private payers and governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of using the SmartVest System. Our home care revenue comes from reimbursement from commercial payers, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and direct patient payments. Reimbursement for HFCWO therapy and the SmartVest System varies among public and private insurance providers.
 
A key strategy to grow sales is achieving world class customer service and support for our patients and clinicians and increasing the number of covered lives across a broad payer market. We do this with an established and effective reimbursement department working on behalf of the patient by processing physician paperwork, seeking insurance authorization and processing claims. The skill and knowledge gained and offered by our reimbursement department is an important factor in building our revenue and serving patients’ financial interests. Our payment terms generally allow patients to acquire the SmartVest System over a period of one to 15 months, which is consistent with reimbursement procedures followed by Medicare and other third parties. The payment amount we receive for any single referral may vary based on a number of factors, including Medicare and third-party reimbursement processes and policies. The patient retains the risk of reimbursement to the Company in the event of non-payment by third-party payers. The reimbursement department includes the payer relations function working directly with all payer types to increase the covered lives for the SmartVest System with national and regional private insurers and applicable state and federal government entities as well as to maintain all of the current licenses with state and federal government and payer contracts.

Our SmartVest System is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0483. Currently, the Medicare total allowable amount of reimbursement for this billing code is approximately $13,000. The allowed amount for state Medicaid programs ranges from approximately $8,000 to $13,000, which is similar to commercial payers. Actual reimbursement from third-party payers can vary and can be significantly less than the full allowable amount. Deductions from the allowable amount, such as co-payments, deductibles and/or maximums on durable medical equipment, decrease the reimbursement received from the third-party payer. Collecting a full allowable amount depends on our ability to obtain reimbursement from the patient’s secondary and/or supplemental insurance if the patient has additional coverage, or our ability to collect amounts from individual patients.
 
Most patients are able to qualify for reimbursement and payment from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance or combinations of the foregoing. We expect that subsequent generations of HFCWO products also will qualify for reimbursement under Medicare and most major health plans. However, some third-party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. In addition, we face the risk that new or modified products could have a lower reimbursement rate, or that the levels of reimbursement currently available for our existing products could decrease, which would hamper our ability to market and sell that product. Consequently, our sales will continue to depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, even though our devices may have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payer involved and the setting in which the procedure is furnished.
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. federal government’s declaration of a public health emergency in March 2020, CMS implemented a number of temporary rule changes and waivers to allow prescribers to best treat patients during the period of the public health emergency. These waivers are retroactively effective to March 1, 2020. Clinical indications and documentation typically required will not be enforced for respiratory related products including the SmartVest System (solely with respect to Medicare patients). The minimum documentation now requires a valid order and documentation of a respiratory-related diagnosis. Face-to-face and in-person requirements for respiratory devices are being waived while the waiver is in place. The CMS waiver was recently extended in conjunction with the extension of the federal public health emergency for an additional 90-day period beginning July 15, 2022.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) capabilities consist of full-time engineering staff and several consultants. We periodically engage consultants and contract engineering employees to supplement our development initiatives. Our team has a demonstrated record of developing new products that receive the appropriate product approvals and regulatory clearances around the world.
 
During fiscal 2022 and 2021, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $1,356,000 and $1,722,000, or 3.3% and 4.8% of our net revenues, respectively. As a percentage of sales, we expect spending on R&D expenses to decrease significantly during fiscal 2023 as compared with fiscal 2022, as we conclude the design and testing of our next generation device in preparation for an anticipated product launch during the first half of fiscal 2023. Product enhancements were driven by voice of customer survey and in-person information focused on patient useability and device portability. We also estimate that the next generation product will be a lower cost of goods compared to the SmartVest SQL.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
As of June 30, 2022, we held 13 United States and 43 foreign-issued patents covering the SmartVest System and its underlying technology and had 13 pending United States and foreign patent applications. These patents and patent applications offer coverage in the field of air pressure pulse delivery to a human in support of airway clearance.
 
We generally pursue patent protection for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices in foreign countries that we have identified as key markets for our products. These markets include the European Union, Japan, and other countries.
 
7

 

We also have received 10 U.S. and 100 foreign trademark and service mark registrations.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our headquarters in New Prague, Minnesota includes a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility of more than 14,000 square feet, and we are certified on an annual basis to be compliant with International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 quality system standards. Our site has been audited regularly by the FDA and ISO, in accordance with their practices, and we maintain our operations in a manner consistent with their requirements for a medical device manufacturer. While components are outsourced to meet our detailed specifications, each SmartVest System is assembled, tested, and approved for final shipment at our manufacturing site in New Prague, consistent with FDA, Underwriters Laboratory, and ISO standards. Many of our strategic suppliers are located within 100 miles of our headquarters, which enables us to closely monitor our component supply chain. We maintain established inventory levels for critical components and finished goods to assure continuity of supply. During fiscal 2022 we experienced longer lead times for critical electronic components related to worldwide supply shortages due to COVID-19 and the related U.S. and global economic recovery. We did not experience any material disruptions to customer shipments in fiscal 2022.
Product Warranties
 
We provide a warranty on the SmartVest System that covers the cost of replacement parts and labor, or a new SmartVest System in the event we determine a full replacement is necessary. For each home care SmartVest System initially purchased and currently located in the U.S. and Canada, we provide a lifetime warranty to the individual patient for whom the SmartVest System is prescribed. For sales to institutions and HME distributors within the U.S., and for all international sales, except Canadian home care, we provide a three-year warranty.
Competition
 
The original HFCWO technology was licensed to American Biosystems, Inc. (now part of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.) (“Hillrom”), which, until the introduction of our original MedPulse Respiratory Vest System® in 2000, was the only manufacturer of a product with HFCWO technology cleared for market by the FDA (Hillrom’s The Vest® Airway Clearance System). Respiratory Technologies, Inc. (now RespirTech, part of Koninklijke Phillips N.V.) received FDA clearance to market their HFCWO product, the inCourage® Airway Clearance Therapy in 2005. Both Hillrom and RespirTech employ a direct-to-patient model, with RespirTech additionally offering its HFCWO device through selected DME distributors.
 
The AffloVest® from Tactile Systems Technology Inc. (“Tactile Medical”) also participates in the same market as our SmartVest System. Tactile Medical primarily sells its device through DME companies who distribute home care medical devices and supplies. Based on annual revenue, we estimate that Hillrom maintains the highest market share in HFCWO followed by RespirTech with Electromed in the third position.
 
Alternative products for administering pulmonary therapy include: Positive Expiratory Pressure, Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation, CPT and breathing techniques. Physicians may prescribe some or all of these devices and techniques, depending upon each patient's health status, severity of disease, compliance, or personal preference. 
 
Key drivers of HFCWO product sales continue to be clinical and cost-effective evidence, technology innovations including wireless connectivity, and HFCWO patient experience benefits such as size, weight of the generator, and product reputation. We believe we distinguish ourselves in these areas with competitive advantages over alternative treatments ultimately improving the patient comfort, ease of use, and the effectiveness of HFCWO treatment. Because HFCWO is not “technique dependent,” as compared to most other alternative pulmonary therapy products, therapy remains consistent and controlled for the duration of treatment.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Medicare and Medicaid
 
Recent government and private sector initiatives in the U.S. and foreign countries aim at limiting the growth of health care costs including: price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements. These initiatives are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices that result in better clinical outcomes. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement the program will pay for particular procedures or treatments, restricting coverage for certain products or services, and implementing other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Many private insurance programs look to Medicare as a guide in setting coverage policies and payment amounts. These initiatives have created an increasing level of price sensitivity among our customers.

Home Medical Equipment Licensing
 
Although we do not fall under competitive bidding for Medicare, we often must satisfy the same licensing requirements as other DME providers that qualify for competitive bidding. In response to out-of-state businesses winning the competitive bidding process, which had a significant impact on small local DME businesses, many states have enacted regulations that require a DME provider to have an in-state business presence, specifically through state HME licensing boards or through state Medicaid programs. In order to do business with any patients in the state or to be a provider for the state Medicaid program, a DME provider must have an in-state presence. In addition to Minnesota, the location of our corporate headquarters, we have a licensed in-state presence in three other states. We also maintain an in-state presence in California in order to meet their state Medicaid requirements. In-state presence requirements vary from state to state, but generally require a physical location that is staffed and open during regular business hours. We are licensed to do business in all states except for Alaska and Hawaii.
Product Regulations
 
Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices, and compliance with these laws and regulations entails significant costs for us. Our regulatory and quality assurance departments provide detailed oversight in their areas of responsibility to support required clearances and approvals to market our products.
 
In addition to the clearances and approvals discussed below, we obtained ISO 13485 certification in January 2005 and receive annual certification of our compliance to the current ISO quality standards.
 
FDA Requirements
 
We have received clearance from the FDA to market our products, including the SmartVest System. We may be required to obtain additional FDA clearance before marketing a new or modified product in the U.S., either through the 510(k) clearance process or the more complex premarket approval process. The process may be time consuming and expensive, particularly if human clinical trials are required. Failure to obtain such clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.
 
Continuing Product Regulation
 
In addition to its approval processes for new products, the FDA may require testing and post-market surveillance programs to monitor the safety and effectiveness of previously cleared products that have been commercialized and may prevent or limit further marketing of products based on the results of post-mark surveillance results. At any time after marketing clearance of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements and current medical device reporting regulations. Product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial market clearance. The failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims.
 
We must register annually with the FDA as a device manufacturer and, as a result, are subject to periodic FDA inspection for compliance with the FDA’s QSR requirements that require us to adhere to certain extensive regulations. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. We also must maintain certain certifications to sell products internationally, and we undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.

Advertising and marketing of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. Competitors and others also can initiate litigation relating to advertising and/or marketing claims. If the FDA were to determine our promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared claim of use, it is possible we would need to modify our training or promotional materials or be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions that could result in civil fines or criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities could also take similar action if they were to determine that our promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties.
 
European Union and Other Regions
 
European Union rules require that medical products receive the right to affix the CE mark, demonstrating adherence to quality standards and compliance with relevant European Union Medical Device Directives (“MDD”). Products that bear CE mark can be imported to, sold or distributed within the European Union. We obtained clearance to use the CE mark on our products in April 2005. Renewal of CE marking is required every five years, and our notified body performs an annual audit to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. We have maintained our CE marking in good standing since originally receiving it and most recently renewed it in January 2020. The renewal of our MDD certificate will allow us to continue to CE mark and sell our SmartVest SQL device, with no substantial changes, in the European Union until the certificate expires in May 2024. We are currently working on finalizing updates to the quality system to achieve full compliance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (EU MDR) which came into effect in May 2021. We also require all of our distributors in the European Union and other regions to comply with their home country regulations in our distributor agreements.
Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Section 6002 of the PPACA) (the “Sunshine Act”) was adopted on February 1, 2013, to create transparency for the financial relationship between medical device companies and physicians and/or teaching hospitals (covered recipients). In January 2021, the Sunshine Act was expanded to cover payments made to these additional covered recipients, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives. The Sunshine Act requires all manufacturers of drugs and medical devices to annually report to CMS any payments or any other “transfers of value” made to any covered recipients, including but not limited to consulting fees, grants, clinical research support, royalties, honoraria, meals, and value of long-term use (over 90 days) of evaluation equipment. This information is then posted on a public website so that consumers can learn how much was paid to their physician by drug and medical device companies. The Sunshine Act requires ongoing data collection and annual management and reporting by us and imposes civil penalties for manufacturers that fail to report timely, accurately, or completely to CMS.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal health care laws apply to the marketing of our products and when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally funded health care programs. The principal applicable federal laws include:

● | the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally funded health care program; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from profiting (actually or potentially) from their own referrals. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10

 

There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. Enforcement of all of these regulations has become increasingly stringent, particularly due to more prevalent use of the whistleblower provisions under the False Claims Act, which allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties and disbarment from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.
 
HIPAA, HITECH and Other Privacy Regulations
 
Federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) set forth privacy and security standards that govern the use and disclosure of protected electronic health information by “covered entities,” which include healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. Because we provide our products directly to patients and bill third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance companies, we are a “covered entity” and must comply with these standards. Failure to comply with HIPAA and HITECH or any state or foreign laws regarding personal data protection may result in significant fines or penalties and/or negative publicity. In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA and HITECH, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA and HITECH. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
 
The HIPAA and HITECH health care fraud and false statement statutes also prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other medical device companies, our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing, sterilization, and disposal processes. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy
 
Protecting the privacy of customer and personnel information is important to us, and we maintain security protocols and processes, including ongoing training and education for all personnel, designed to combat the risk of unauthorized access or inadvertent disclosure. Our business operations involve confidential information, including patient health information subject to regulation as discussed under “HIPAA, HITECH and Other Privacy Regulations” above. Our information technology infrastructure is designed to offer reliability, scalability, performance, security and privacy for our personnel, clients and third-party contractors.
 
We maintain comprehensive compliance and security programs designed to help safeguard and ensure the integrity of the confidential information we possess, which includes both organizational and technical control measures. We also have programs in place to monitor the safety of confidential information as well as plans for immediate, coordinated action in the event of a potential security incident. We routinely conduct employee trainings on important information security procedures and engage with independent third-party firms to test and measure compliance on these security measures. In addition, we have maintained appropriate cyber insurance policies that limit the financial risk of any potential incident. Our cyber insurance policies include dedicated support for remediating a specific cybersecurity or data privacy incident and limit the potential financial risk associated with an actual incident.

Even though we have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to help protect the confidential data we possess and the integrity of our information systems and infrastructure, these safeguards may not be effective in preventing future cybersecurity incidents or data breaches.
 
Human Capital
 
We believe that our dedicated, talented employees are our most valuable resource and a key strength in accomplishing our collective mission and goals. As of June 30, 2022, we had 156 employees, an increase of 15.4% from fiscal 2021, who are located in 29 states throughout the United States. 18 of our employees were respiratory therapists licensed by appropriate state professional organizations. We also had approximately 250 respiratory therapists and health care professionals retained on a non-exclusive, independent contractor basis to provide training to our customers in the U.S. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
 
We are committed to attracting, retaining, and developing diverse and high-performing talent that includes a strong focus on performance and development, total rewards, diversity, inclusion and equity, and employee safety. These serve as the pillars to our human capital management framework.
 
We understand that our success and growth depend on attracting, retaining, and developing talent across all levels of the organization. Our recruitment strategies are continuously reviewed with leadership and partners to ensure our practices align with our mission, purpose, and values.
 
We believe in ensuring that employees understand our mission, purpose, and goals as well as their impact on our success. We use an annual performance review process to support development and performance discussions with employees. In addition, every employee is eligible to participate in our incentive plan, which allows for us to share the rewards of the company with the people who significantly contribute to our success.
 
To cultivate a learning culture that provides enhancement and growth for our people, we offer educational assistance, online training (220 courses completed during fiscal 2022), seminars, specific skill training, and participation in business and industry organizations. We are also committed to contributing our talents and resources to serve the communities in which we live and work through various charitable campaigns, employee programs and volunteerism. We believe that this commitment assists in our efforts to attract and retain employees.
 
We believe that sharing rewards is essential to increasing employee engagement and improving morale and creating a positive culture. We also offer our employees a competitive salary and benefits package and are committed to continuous review of these programs. These benefits include but are not limited to retirement savings, a variety of health insurance options and other benefits programs, including dental and vision, disability insurance, contributions to health savings accounts, paid maternity/paternity leave, and wellness resources. In addition, we offer opportunities for remote work and flexible schedules and location, depending on business needs and the specific role.
 
We are committed to ensuring a diverse workforce in a safe environment by maintaining compliance with applicable employment laws and governmental regulations. Treating employees with dignity and equality is of utmost importance in everything we do. We take pride in the fact that women represent 53% of our total managerial roles and comprise 57% of our executive leadership team. We pride ourselves on accepting, hearing, and celebrating multiple approaches and points of view and building on an inclusive and diverse culture.
 
Safety is a vital aspect to the success of our people and business. We are proud of our employees’ collective commitment to secure and maintain safe work practices that have resulted in zero lost time injuries within our manufacturing operations. We also provide wellbeing services to support each employee’s physical and mental health and will continue to emphasize the importance of the safety and health of our employees in all we do.
