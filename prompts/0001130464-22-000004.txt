ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
History and Organization
Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (together with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a customer-focused, growth-oriented utility company headquartered in Rapid City, South Dakota (incorporated in South Dakota in 1941).
We operate our business in the United States, reporting our operating results through our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities segments. Certain unallocated corporate expenses that support our operating segments are presented as Corporate and Other. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we integrated our power generation and mining businesses within the Electric Utilities segment. The alignment is consistent with the current way our CODM evaluates the performance of the business and makes decisions related to the allocation of resources. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. See further segment information in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Electric Utilities segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity to approximately 218,000 electric utility customers in Colorado, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming. We also own and operate non-regulated power generation and mining assets that are vertically integrated into our Electric Utilities. Our Electric Utilities own 1,481.5 MW of generation and 8,899 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines.
Our Gas Utilities segment serves approximately 1,094,000 natural gas utility customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Our Gas Utilities own and operate 4,732 miles of intrastate gas transmission pipelines and 41,644 miles of gas distribution mains and service lines, six natural gas storage sites, more than 50,000 horsepower of compression and over 515 miles of gathering lines.
Electric Utilities
We conduct electric utility operations through our Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming subsidiaries. Our electric generating facilities and power purchase agreements provide for the supply of electricity principally to our retail customers. Additionally, we sell excess power to other utilities and marketing companies, including our affiliates. We also provide non-regulated services to our retail customers under the Service Guard Comfort Plan and Tech Services.
Additionally, we own and operate non-regulated power generation and mining assets that are vertically integrated into and primarily support our Electric Utilities. Nearly all of these operations are located at our electric generating complexes and are physically integrated into our Electric Utilities’ operations.

Total Weighted Average Fuel and Purchased Power Cost | $ | 30.17 | | $ | 17.36 | $ | 22.76

____________________
(a)    The 2021 increase in prices paid for fuel and purchased power was primarily driven by unforeseeable and unprecedented market prices for natural gas and electricity during Winter Storm Uri. See further information in the Recent Developments section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Power Purchase and Power Sales Agreements. We have executed various PPAs to support our Electric Utilities’ capacity and energy needs beyond our regulated power plants’ generation, which include long-term related party agreements with our non-regulated power generation businesses. We also have various long-term PSAs. Key contracts are disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Coal Mining. We own and operate a single coal mine through our WRDC subsidiary. We surface mine, process and sell low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal at our mine located immediately adjacent to our Gillette energy complex in the Powder River Basin in northeastern Wyoming, where our five coal-fired power plants are located. We produced approximately 3.5 million tons of coal in 2021.
The mine provides low-sulfur coal directly to these five power plants via a conveyor belt system, minimizing transportation costs. On average, the fuel can be delivered to the adjacent power plants at less than $1.00 per MMBtu, providing very cost competitive fuel to our power plants when compared to alternatives. Nearly all of the mine’s production is sold to our on-site generation facilities under long-term supply contracts.
As of December 31, 2021, we estimated our recoverable reserves to be approximately 178 million tons, based on a life-of-mine engineering study utilizing currently available drilling data and geological information prepared by internal engineering studies. The recoverable reserve life is equal to approximately 51 years at the current production levels.
Transmission and Distribution. Through our Electric Utilities, we own electric transmission and distribution systems composed of high voltage lines (greater than 69 kV) and low voltage lines (69 kV or less). We also jointly operate an electric transmission system, referred to as the Common Use System, with Basin Electric Power Cooperative and Powder River Energy Corporation. Each participant in the Common Use System individually owns assets that are operated together for a single system. The Common Use System also provides transmission service to our Transmission Tie. South Dakota Electric owns 35% of the Transmission Tie. The Transmission Tie is further discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
At December 31, 2021, our Electric Utilities owned the electric transmission and distribution lines shown below:

Utility | State | Transmission (a)(in Line Miles) | Distribution(in Line Miles)
Colorado Electric | Colorado | 598 | | 3,157
South Dakota Electric (b) | South Dakota, Wyoming | 1,192 | | 2,566
Wyoming Electric | Wyoming | 59 | | 1,327
 | | 1,849 | | 7,050

____________________
(a)    Electric transmission line miles include voltages of 69 kV and above.
(b)    South Dakota Electric transmission line miles include 43 miles within the Common Use System.
Material transmission services agreements are disclosed in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonal Variations of Business. Our Electric Utilities are seasonal businesses and weather patterns may impact their operating performance. Demand for electricity is sensitive to seasonal cooling, heating and industrial load requirements, as well as market price. In particular, cooling demand is often greater in the summer and heating demand in often greater in the winter.
Competition. We generally have limited competition for the retail generation and distribution of electricity in our service areas. Various legislative or regulatory restructuring and competitive initiatives have been discussed in several of the states in which our utilities operate. These initiatives would be aimed at increasing competition or providing for distributed generation. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our utilities. In Colorado, our electric utility is subject to rules which may require competitive bidding for generation supply. Because of these rules, we face competition from other utilities and non-affiliated IPPs for the right to supply electric energy and capacity for Colorado Electric when resource plans require additional resources. Additionally, electrification initiatives in our service territories could increase demand for electricity and increase customer growth.
The independent power industry consists of many strong and capable competitors, some of which may have more extensive operations or greater financial resources than we possess. With respect to the merchant power sector, FERC has taken steps to increase access to the national transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity to foster competition within the wholesale electricity markets. Our non-regulated power generation businesses could face greater competition if utilities are permitted to robustly invest in power generation assets. Conversely, state regulatory rules requiring utilities to competitively bid generation resources may provide opportunity for IPPs in some regions. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our non-regulated power generation businesses.
Our strategy for our mining business is to sell nearly all of our production to on-site generation facilities under long-term supply contracts. Historically, any off-site sales have been to consumers within close proximity to the WRDC mine. Rail transport market opportunities for WRDC are limited due to the lower heating value (Btu) of the coal, combined with the fact that the WRDC mine is served by only one railroad, resulting in less competitive transportation rates. Additionally, coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. Costs and other factors relating to these alternative fuels, such as safety, environmental and availability considerations affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel.
Rates and Regulation. Our Electric Utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the public utilities commissions in the states where they operate and the FERC for certain assets and transactions. These commissions oversee services and facilities, rates and charges, accounting, valuation of property, depreciation rates and various other matters. Rate decisions are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, capital expenditures, the prudence of costs we incur, views concerning appropriate rates of return, general economic conditions and the political environment. Certain commissions also have jurisdiction over the issuance of debt or securities and the creation of liens on property located in their states to secure bonds or other securities.
The following table provides regulatory information for each of our Electric Utilities:

Subsidiary | Jurisdic-tion | Authorized Rate of Return on Equity | Authorized Return on Rate Base | Authorized Capital Structure Debt/Equity | Authorized Rate Base (in millions) | Effective Date | Additional Regulatory Mechanisms | Percentage of Power Marketing Profit Shared with Customers
Colorado Electric (a) | CO | 9.37% | 7.43% | 48%/52% | $539.6 | 1/2017 | ECA, TCA, PCCA, EECR/DSM, RESA | 90%

Wyoming Electric (a) | WY | 9.90% | 7.98% | 46%/54% | $376.8 | 10/2014 | PCA, EECR/DSM, Rate Base Recovery on Acquisition Adjustment | N/A 

____________________
(a)    For both Colorado Electric and Wyoming Electric, transmission investments are recovered through retail rates rather than FERC Transmission Tariffs.
(b)    Includes $131.3 million in 2021 rate base for the 2021 Projected Common Use System formula rate that is updated annually and $17.1 million in rate base for the Transmission Tie that is based on the approved stated rate from 2005.
The regulatory provisions for recovering the costs to supply electricity vary by state. We have cost adjustment mechanisms for our Electric Utilities that allow us to pass the prudently-incurred cost of fuel and purchased power to customers. These mechanisms allow the utility operating in that state to collect, or refund the difference between the cost of commodities and certain services embedded in our base rates and the actual cost of the commodities and certain services without filing a general rate review. In addition, some states allow for recovery of new capital investment placed in service between base rate reviews through approved rider tariffs. These tariffs allow the utility a return on the investment.
A summary of mechanisms we have in place are shown in the table below:

Electric Utility Jurisdiction | Cost Recovery Mechanisms
Environmental Cost | Energy Efficiency | Transmission Expense | Fuel Cost | Transmission Capital | Purchased Power | RESA
Colorado Electric | | þ | þ | þ | þ | þ | þ
South Dakota Electric (SD) (a) | þ | | þ | þ | þ | þ | 
South Dakota Electric (WY) (b) | | þ | þ | þ | | þ |

Wyoming Electric | | þ | þ | þ | | þ | 

____________________
(a)    South Dakota Electric’s Environmental Cost (EIA) and Transmission Capital (TFA) tariffs were suspended for a six-year moratorium period effective July 1, 2017. On January 7, 2020, South Dakota Electric received approval from the SDPUC to extend the 6-year moratorium period by an additional 3 years whereby these recovery mechanisms will not be effective prior to July 1, 2026.
(b)    South Dakota Electric has WPSC authorization to accumulate certain Energy Efficiency costs in a regulatory asset with determination of recovery to be made in the next rate review.
(c)    South Dakota Electric has an approved FERC Transmission Tariff based on a formulaic approach that determines the revenue component of South Dakota Electric’s open access transmission tariff.

Gas Utilities
We conduct natural gas utility operations through our Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming subsidiaries. Our Gas Utilities transport and distribute natural gas through our distribution network to approximately 1,094,000 customers. Additionally, we sell contractual pipeline capacity and gas commodities to other utilities and marketing companies, including our affiliates, on an as-available basis.
We also provide non-regulated services to our regulated customers. Black Hills Energy Services provides natural gas supply to approximately 52,400 retail distribution customers under the Choice Gas Program in Nebraska and Wyoming. Additionally, we provide services under the Service Guard Comfort Plan, Tech Services and HomeServe.

We procure natural gas for our distribution customers from a diverse mix of producers, processors and marketers and generally use hedging, physical fixed-price purchases and market-based price purchases to achieve dollar-cost averaging within our natural gas portfolio. The majority of our procured natural gas is transported in interstate pipelines under firm transportation service agreements.
In addition to company-owned natural gas storage assets in Arkansas, Colorado and Wyoming, we also contract with third-party transportation providers for natural gas storage service to provide gas supply during the winter heating season and to meet peak day customer demand for natural gas.
The following table summarizes certain information regarding our company-owned regulated underground gas storage facilities as of December 31, 2021:

Seasonal Variations of Business. Our Gas Utilities are seasonal businesses and weather patterns may impact their operating performance. Demand for natural gas is sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements, as well as market price. In particular, demand is often greater in the winter months for heating. Natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, and demand for this product can depend heavily upon weather throughout our service territories. As a result, a significant amount of natural gas revenue is normally recognized in the heating season consisting of the first and fourth quarters. Demand for natural gas can also be impacted by summer temperatures and precipitation, which can affect demand for irrigation.
Competition. We generally have limited competition for the retail distribution of natural gas in our service areas. Various restructuring and competitive initiatives have been discussed in several of the states in which our utilities operate. These initiatives are aimed at increasing competition. Additionally, electrification initiatives in our service territories could negatively impact demand for natural gas and decrease customer growth. To date, these initiatives have not had a material impact on our utilities. Although we face competition from independent marketers for the sale of natural gas to our industrial and commercial customers, in instances where independent marketers displace us as the seller of natural gas, we still collect a charge for transporting the gas through our distribution network.
Rates and Regulation. Our Gas Utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the public utility commissions in the states where they operate. These commissions oversee services and facilities, rates and charges, accounting, valuation of property, depreciation rates and various other matters. The public utility commissions determine the rates we are allowed to charge for our utility services. Rate decisions are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, capital expenditures, the prudence of costs we incur, views concerning appropriate rates of return, general economic conditions and the political environment. Certain commissions also have jurisdiction over the issuance of debt or securities and the creation of liens on property located in their states to secure bonds or other securities.
Our Gas Utilities are authorized to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms allowing rate adjustments reflecting changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and recovery of all the costs prudently incurred in purchasing gas for customers. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other recovery mechanisms, which vary by utility, allow us to recover certain costs or earn a return on capital investments, such as energy efficiency plan costs and system safety and integrity investments.

Utility Regulation Characteristics
Federal Regulation
Energy Policy Act. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions to create an Electric Reliability Organization, which is required to promulgate mandatory reliability standards governing the operation of the bulk power system in the U.S. FERC certified NERC as the Electric Reliability Organization and also issued an initial order approving many reliability standards that went into effect in 2007. Entities that violate standards can be subject to fines and can also be assessed non-monetary penalties, depending upon the nature and severity of the violation.
Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, all public utilities subject to FERC’s jurisdiction must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with FERC that govern the rates, and terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Public utilities are also subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by FERC. FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between public utilities and their affiliates. Our public Electric Utility subsidiaries provide FERC-jurisdictional services subject to FERC’s oversight.
Our Electric Utilities entities are authorized by FERC to make wholesale sales of electric capacity and energy at market-based rates under tariffs on file with FERC. As a condition of their market-based rate authority, Electric Quarterly Reports are filed with FERC. Our Electric Utilities own and operate FERC-jurisdictional interstate transmission facilities and provide open access transmission service under tariffs on file with FERC. Our Electric Utilities are subject to routine audit by FERC with respect to their compliance with FERC’s regulations.
PUHCA 2005. PUHCA 2005 provides FERC authority with respect to the books and records of a utility holding company. As a utility holding company whose assets consist primarily of investments in our subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are public utilities and also a centralized service company subsidiary, BHSC, we are subject to FERC’s authority under PUHCA 2005.
PUHCA 2005 reiterated the definition and benefits of EWG status. Under PUHCA 2005, an EWG is an entity or generator engaged, directly or indirectly through one or more affiliates, exclusively in the business of owning, operating or both owning and operating all or part of one or more eligible facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale. Though EWGs are public utilities within the definition set forth in the Federal Power Act and are subject to FERC regulation of rates and charges, they are exempt from other FERC requirements. Through its subsidiaries, Black Hills Corporation is affiliated with three EWGs, Wygen I, Pueblo Airport Generation (facilities #4-5) and Top of Iowa. Each of these three EWGs have been granted market-based rate authority.
Environmental Matters
In November 2020, we announced clean energy goals to reduce GHG emissions that are based on prudent and proven solutions while minimizing cost impacts to our customers. See more information in Key Elements of our Business Strategy within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are subject to significant state and federal environmental regulations that encourage the use of clean energy technologies and regulate emissions of GHGs. We have undertaken initiatives to meet current requirements and to prepare for anticipated future regulations, reduce GHG emissions, and respond to state renewable and energy efficiency goals. Compliance with future environmental regulations could result in substantial cost.
In July of 2019, the EPA adopted the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which requires states to develop plans by 2022 for GHG reductions from coal-fired power plants. In a January 2021 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit issued a decision vacating and remanding the Affordable Clean Energy rule. That decision, if not successfully appealed or reconsidered, would allow the EPA to proceed with alternate regulation of coal-fired power plants, either reviving the Clean Power Plan or proposing additional regulation. Compliance could result in significant investment.
Environmental risk changes constantly with the implementation of new or modified regulations, changing stakeholder interests and needs, and through the introduction of innovative work practices and technologies. We continually assess risk and develop mitigation strategies to manage and ensure compliance across the enterprise successfully and responsibly. For additional information on environmental matters, see Item 1A and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
