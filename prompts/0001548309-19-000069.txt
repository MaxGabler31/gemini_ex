Item 1. Business 
We are a national retailer primarily focused on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and hardware at our stores and on our websites. We also offer our customers the opportunity to acquire home appliance, lawn and garden, fitness, bedding, and other categories of merchandise and product protection agreements through our lease-to-own program that we operate by agreement with a third party. As of February 2, 2019, the Company or its independent dealers and franchisees ("our dealers and franchisees") operated a total of 677 stores across 49 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. In addition to merchandise, we provide our customers with access to a full suite of related services, including home delivery, installation, and extended-service plans. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K we refer to ourselves as "SHO," "our company," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us."
We became a publicly held company immediately following our October 11, 2012 separation (the "2012 Separation") from Sears Holdings Corporation ("Sears Holdings"). 
We operate through two segments—the Sears Hometown segment ("Hometown") and the Sears Outlet segment ("Outlet"). Our Hometown stores are designed to provide our customers with in-store and online access to a wide selection of national brands of home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, depending on the particular store. Our Outlet stores are designed to provide in-store and online access to purchase new, one-of-a-kind, out-of-carton, discontinued, obsolete, used, reconditioned, overstocked, and scratched and dented products, collectively "outlet-value products" across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, mattresses, furniture, and lawn and garden equipment at value-oriented prices. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our segments.
The majority of our Hometown stores are operated by our dealers and franchisees. SHO provides brand and marketing support and inventory on consignment. We initiated efforts to franchise Outlet stores in 2012, with the first stores transferred to franchisees during the 2013 fiscal year. Since the second quarter of 2015, franchising of additional Hometown and Outlet stores except to existing Company franchisees has been suspended by the Company. We pay our dealers and franchisees commissions based on their net sales of our inventory that we consign to them. We also authorize our dealers and franchisees to sell post-sale services, such as extended-service plans, for which we also pay commissions.
Hometown
In fiscal 2018 revenue from our Hometown segment was $958.5 million. As of February 2, 2019, the Company or our dealers and franchisees operated a total of 549 Sears Hometown and Hardware stores located across 49 states, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda.
Our Hometown segment operates through four distinct formats: Sears Hometown Stores ("Hometown Stores"), Sears Hardware Stores ("Hardware Stores"), Sears Home Appliance Showrooms ("Home Appliance Showrooms") and Buddy's Home Furnishing Stores ("Buddy's Stores"). 

• | Hometown Stores. Our Hometown Stores and website offer products and services across a wide selection of merchandise categories, including home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, sporting goods, and household goods, with the majority of business driven by big-ticket home appliance and lawn and garden sales. Most of our Hometown Stores carry Sears-branded products, including products branded with the KENMORE®, CRAFTSMAN®, and DIEHARD® marks (the "KCD Marks"), and an assortment of other national brands. Primarily independently operated, predominantly located in smaller communities and averaging approximately 8,500 square feet, Hometown Stores are designed to serve trade areas that may not support a full-service big-box retailer. As of February 2, 2019, there were 499 Hometown Stores in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Hometown Stores also sell products and services through our website www.SearsHometownStores.com. When a dealer exits a location, the Company may take over the operation of a store, generally on an interim basis, until the location can be transferred to another dealer. At any given time the Company is generally operating a number of stores that are in transition from one dealer to another dealer. Transition stores are not included in our count of Company-operated locations due to the expected short-term nature of transition operation. Dealers operated 497, and we operated two, Hometown stores.

• | Hardware Stores. Our Hardware Stores and website offer products and services across a wide selection of merchandise categories with sales primarily driven by home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other home improvement products including products typically found in local hardware stores, such as fasteners, electrical supplies, and plumbing supplies. Our Hardware stores average approximately 23,000 square feet in size, are primarily located in suburban trade areas and are positioned as local stores designed to appeal to convenience-oriented customers These stores carry Craftsman brand tools and lawn and garden equipment, and a wide assortment of other national brands and other home improvement products. As of February 2, 2019, there were 15 Hardware Stores in ten states, all of which carry a selection of Kenmore and other national brands of home appliances. Hardware Stores also sell products and services through our website www.SearsHardwareStores.com. Franchisees operated seven, and we operated eight, of these stores. 


• | Home Appliance Showrooms. Our Home Appliance Showrooms and website offer home appliances and related services in stores primarily located in strip malls and lifestyle centers in metropolitan areas. Averaging 5,000 square feet with a simple, primarily appliance-showroom design, our Home Appliance Showrooms offer quality-focused customers a unique store shopping experience. Home Appliance Showroom sales are primarily driven by home appliances as well as, in certain stores, mattresses. These stores carry Kenmore and other national brands of home appliances. As of February 2, 2019, there were 27 Home Appliance Showrooms in eight states. Home Appliance Showrooms also sell products and services through our website www.SearsHomeApplianceShowroom.com. Franchisees operated 11 of these stores, and we operated 16 stores. 


• | Buddy's Home Furnishings Stores. Our Buddy's Home Furnishings Stores, where we are a franchisee, enable us to benefit from Buddy's expertise and systems infrastructure in the rent-to-own business in which we own the inventory that we rent to our customers. As of February 2, 2019, there were eight Buddy's Home Furnishings Stores in two states, all of which were operated by the Company. 

Outlet
Our Sears Outlet stores (the "Outlet Stores") are designed to provide in-store and online access to purchase outlet-value products across a broad assortment of merchandise categories, including home appliances, mattresses, apparel, sporting goods, lawn and garden equipment, tools, and other household goods, including furniture, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices. Outlet Stores serve as a liquidation channel for outlet-value home appliances from major appliance vendors. In 2018 Outlet’s most significant merchandise category was home appliances, which made up 82.7% of our Outlet sales revenue. Outlet-value products are generally covered by a warranty. Outlet Stores also offer a full suite of extended-service plans and services. As of February 2, 2019, Outlet operated 128 locations in 33 states and Puerto Rico, all of which offer a wide range of outlet-value products. Outlet also sells products and services through our website www.SearsOutlet.com. As of February 2, 2019, we operated 123 Outlet Stores and franchisees operated five Outlet Stores. In fiscal 2018 revenue from our Outlet segment was $491.4 million. 
Merchandise and Services from Transform Holdco LLC
Following the 2012 Separation and until mid-February 2019 we had significant business relationships with Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries, and we relied heavily on them for merchandise and services through various agreements among the Company, Sears Holdings and, in some circumstances, subsidiaries of Sears Holdings (as amended, the “Operative Agreements”). Edward S. Lampert (who with investment affiliates (together "ESL") owns 58.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock), was Chief Executive Officer of Sears Holdings, and he served until February 12, 2019 as a member of Sears Holdings’s Board of Directors and as its Chairman of the Board of Directors. 
During October 2018, Sears Holdings and many of its subsidiaries (together the “Sears Holdings Companies”) filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code. The Company, which is not a subsidiary of Sears Holdings, is not included in the bankruptcy petitions filed by Sears Holdings and its subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor its subsidiaries have filed a bankruptcy petition. As part of the Sears Holdings Companies bankruptcy proceedings, Transform Holdco LLC ("Transform Holdco") acquired most of the operating assets (including Sears stores) and related assets of the Sears Holdings Companies, and the Operative Agreements were assigned by the Sears Holdings Companies to, and the obligations thereunder were assumed by, Transform Holdco on or about February 11, 2019. See "Risk Factors " in this Item 1A. According to publicly available information, ESL controls Transform Holdco.

Competition
Hometown
Our Hometown business is subject to highly competitive conditions, with varying levels of competition in each store’s trade area. Hometown Stores and Hardware Stores compete with a wide variety of retailers handling similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, discounters, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers, wholesale clubs, and many other competitors operating on a national, regional, or local level. Hometown Stores and Hardware Stores also compete with online and catalog businesses that have similar merchandise offerings. Home Appliance Showrooms compete with all of the previously listed competitors to the extent that they sell home appliances.
The key national competitors of the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms are The Home Depot, Lowe’s and Best Buy, as well as Ace Hardware and True Value for the Hardware Stores, and Tractor Supply for the Hometown Stores and the Hardware Stores, all of which offer consumers lines of merchandise that are the same as or similar to lines of merchandise offered by the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms. Transform Holdco's Sears stores offer consumers lines of merchandise that are similar to the lines of merchandise offered by the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms. As our stores have expanded their merchandise offerings, the level of competition between the Hometown Stores, the Hardware Stores, and the Home Appliance Showrooms and Transform Holdco's Sears stores has increased. In addition to being the principal merchandise vendor for the Hometown business, Transform Holdco also continues to provide some e-commerce services and support to SHO, and Transform Holdco's online sales compete with our business.
We believe that the key differentiating factors among competitors operating in this industry include price, product assortment and quality, service and convenience, brand recognition, existence of loyalty programs, online and multichannel capabilities and availability of retail-related services such as access to lease-to-own and credit-card programs and product delivery, installation, assembly and repair.
Outlet
The Outlet Stores and SearsOutlet.com operate in the outlet-value retail industry. In our primary product category, appliances, our Outlet Stores and SearsOutlet.com compete at one end of the spectrum with big-box retailers that sell primarily new in-box product, as new in-box product competes both with new in-box product and out-of-box product sold in the Outlet Stores. To the extent these big-box competitors choose to liquidate their own out-of-box product on their sales floors, this product would compete directly with out-of-box product sold in the Outlet Stores. At the other end of the spectrum are the locally owned appliance retailers that have historically comprised the bulk of the Outlet Stores' direct competition for sales of out-of-box product. These locally owned appliance retailers generally sell both out-of-box and new in-box appliances. Online retailers that sell new or out-of-box appliances are also competitors.
The Outlet Stores' key national competitors with respect to new, in-box appliances are The Home Depot, Lowe’s and Best Buy. With respect to as-is appliances, which represent 63% of the Outlet segment's 2018 sales, there are no national competitors.  In addition, as we have expanded our product lines into categories such as mattresses and furniture, we face additional competition from other discount retailers that focus on those product categories. While Transform Holdco's stores provide similar lines of merchandise as the Outlet Stores, the Outlet Stores are primarily value-price sellers of distressed, refurbished, and marked-out-of-stock merchandise, which merchandise Transform Holdco's stores generally do not sell in what we believe are significant volumes to consumers. As our Outlet business expands its merchandise offerings (for example, our recent increased emphasis on mattresses and furniture) and the level of online price transparency for major appliances, the level of competition between the Outlet Stores and Transform Holdco's stores is increasing.
We believe that the key differentiating factor between competitors operating in the outlet-value retail industry is price. Other factors include product assortment and quality, service and convenience, brand recognition, existence of loyalty programs, online and multichannel capabilities, and availability of retail-related services such as access to credit and product delivery.

Our Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths are the following:
Our stores carry a wide variety of well-known, brand-name merchandise. We offer our customers a broad selection of products, including well-known consumer brand names such as Kenmore, Whirlpool®, Samsung, and Craftsman, and we strive to offer high in-stock levels. Our Hometown stores are the only national retail chain that carries the top appliance brands. This ability to offer a wide variety of well-known, consumer brand-name merchandise enables us to remain competitive in our trade areas and to continue to attract customers. 
We operate across the nation through distinctly tailored store formats. Our different store formats are targeted to the trade areas in which they compete. Our Hometown Stores offer customers in more rural communities a wide variety of merchandise. In those trade areas, we compete against larger national or regional big-box stores on the basis of the convenient shopping experience we provide, and we compete against local independent stores based on our product offerings and competitive pricing.
Our Hardware Stores are located in neighborhood centers in suburban areas where customers can fulfill their hardware, lawn and garden and home appliance needs. These stores compete against larger warehouse home centers and smaller local hardware stores by offering a broad assortment of products, convenient outlets, and personalized customer assistance.
Our Home Appliance Showrooms include appealing display floors in metropolitan trade areas where we compete with big-box retailers by offering a compelling service model, a wide assortment of brand-name home appliances, significant online and multi-channel capabilities, and convenient locations. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing our customers with a consultative and educational purchase experience.
Our Outlet Stores offer customers a wide range of outlet-value products at locations across the United States and Puerto Rico. Our Outlet Stores differentiate themselves from their competitors by providing a wide range of outlet-value brand-name products, including Kenmore, Whirlpool, GE, LG, Maytag, and Samsung products, at prices that are significantly lower than list prices.
In addition, SHO has stores located in 49 states as well as Puerto Rico and Bermuda, with over 98% of sales in the United States. The ability to generate revenues with a wide variety of products across a diversified mix of regions and trade areas positions us to be able to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.
Our Outlet Stores are the leading liquidation channel of value-priced home appliances. As the nation’s largest chain retailer of outlet-value home appliances, our Outlet business has become increasingly relevant to major appliance vendors as a liquidation channel for outlet-value appliances. We do not believe that we have any national competitors for outlet-value appliances. 
Our Strategy
We plan to continue to enhance our competitive position, grow our business, and increase our net sales and profitability by implementing the following strategies:
Expand Product Assortment and Optimize Service Offerings. We strive to provide our customers with complete solutions for their home appliance, lawn and garden, hardware, and other related home needs. We regularly evaluate other merchandise categories and types of services to enhance our product and service offerings and to create cross-selling opportunities for adjacent products and services. 
Promote Customer Growth through Enhanced Marketing, Improved Customer Experience, and Integrated Multi-Channel Capabilities. We seek to serve our customers’ needs and drive revenue growth through our integrated multi-channel sale capabilities. We continue to seek to enhance our e-commerce operations and our online product selection to improve our customers’ online shopping experiences. We seek to integrate our online business and our brick-and-mortar stores to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience across channels. On Company-operated websites we offer our customers the option to purchase items online and pick them up in our local stores as well as order out-of-stock and other items from our in-store kiosks. In addition, Sears.com offers customers the option to purchase items online and pick them up in our local stores. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. See, however, "We rely on Transform Holdco for services related to our online business and the processing of online orders" in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We also plan to drive customer growth by refining our marketing initiatives. We believe that we can grow our customer base through advertising in a number of different media, particularly through various forms of digital marketing, including search, social media ads and email marketing. We launched a fully integrated print, digital and television marketing campaign in March 2018 to highlight the unique market position of the Hometown Stores and our strengths in the home appliances category. This included the Company’s first ever national television commercials. 
We believe that quality customer service contributes to increased store visits and purchases by our customers. We are focused on building long-term relationships with customers and members by improving their in-store and post-sale experiences. We conduct quality control checks of our store managers and sales associates and our dealers and franchisees to improve the quality of customer interaction and product knowledge in the stores we operate and the stores operated by our dealers and franchisees. We continue to improve and augment our post-sale engagement with customers through access to delivery, assembly, and installation services as well as extended-service plans.
Diversify Our Supply Chain. We intend to continue our efforts to diversify our network of merchandise suppliers and service providers. Such diversification, particularly with respect to merchandise suppliers, is intended to reduce our reliance on Transform Holdco for our inventory. In 2017, we leveraged new systems functionality, enabled by our investments in the IT systems transformation initiative, to enhance our merchandise sourcing and inventory management capabilities. We have established direct purchasing relationships with several of our key strategic product manufacturers which hold significant market share in the product categories we compete in across the industry. SHO's purchases of inventory from Sears Holdings declined to 60% of total purchases in 2018 compared to 78% in 2017. We expect the percentage of total purchases of inventory acquired from Transform Holdco to decrease in the future as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors, particularly as the proportion of SHO's total inventory purchases in the Outlet business continues to increase as expected.
Provide Industry-Leading Financing Options.  We intend to continue to provide our customers many convenient methods of financing their purchases including extended credit-card offers and lease-to-own alternatives. We believe that our store operating practices and our relationships with the issuer of the Sears credit card and our lease-to-own provider allow us to offer attractive financing choices for our customers that will lead to higher customer loyalty and profitability for the Company. Year-over-year leasing comparable store sales increased 39% in fiscal 2018. Our leasing share of the total business grew 27% versus the prior year, growing to 9% share in 2018. Additionally, third-party commissions received on leasing sales became a more meaningful contributor to our margin improvement.
Grow Commercial Sales. We are seeking to continue to grow our revenue with business customers who can benefit from our extensive merchandise offerings, broad store network, and delivery and service capabilities. Businesses such as builders, landlords, and apartment operators represent an attractive incremental customer base in the communities where we operate. In 2018, commercial sales grew 13%. Gross margin rate, net of commissions paid, improved as a result of a more disciplined commercial pricing process. Dealer and franchisee adoption of the program also continued to grow, with 70% of stores participating in 2018 versus 52% in 2017.
Transform our IT Infrastructure. We are replacing the large majority of our information technology infrastructure, which has been provided since the 2012 Separation by Sears Holdings (prior to mid-February 2019 and thereafter by Transform Holdco), with new systems and processes. We expect this change will provide improved operational flexibility, allow better control of our systems and processes, and reduce some of the risks relating to our relationship with, and dependence on, Transform Holdco. See also "We rely on Transform Holdco and other third parties to provide us with key products and services in connection with the administration of many critical aspects of our business, and we may be required to develop our own systems quickly in order to reduce such dependence" in Part 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the conversion and migration of our information technology infrastructure.
Improve Operating Performance. We plan to focus on various initiatives intended to improve our gross margins and our inventory management. Our inventory-procurement operations are focused on developing customized merchandise assortments based on store demographics, sales history, customer preferences and margin by product division. Our inventory management focuses on keeping products with higher customer demand in stock. In addition, we intend to focus on controlling costs across our business lines, particularly selling and administrative expenses.
Store Activity. We will continue to take proactive steps to make the best use of capital and reduce costs by closing stores that we determine are not sufficiently profitable. We will also continue to selectively identify trade-area opportunities for new stores over the long term based on market potential, including trade areas where Sears Holdings (prior to mid-February 2019 and thereafter by Transform Holdco) has closed a full-line department store.

Our Products and Suppliers
Our focus on the preferences of our customers drives our merchandise selection. Our goal is to offer our customers a selection of brands and products within each of our product categories. Our largest revenue-generating category in 2018 was home appliances, representing approximately 73% of net sales.
We are party to an Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement that was assigned by the Sears Holdings Companies to Transform Holdco (as amended and assigned, the "Merchandising Agreement") pursuant to which subsidiaries of Transform Holdco (1) sell to us, with respect to certain specified product categories, Transform Holdco-branded products (including products branded with the KCD Marks ("KCD Products")) and vendor-branded products obtained from other vendors and suppliers and (2) grant us licenses to use the trademarks owned by Transform Holdco, including the KCD Marks, in connection with the marketing and sale of products sold under the Transform Holdco marks. The initial term of the Merchandising Agreement will expire February 1, 2023 with our right to exercise one three-year extension with respect to KCD Products subject to specified Transform Holdco termination rights and other conditions in the Merchandising Agreement. We expect that our Hometown business will continue to rely on Transform Holdco for a significant majority of its inventory in 2019. 
For the year ended February 2, 2019, products that we acquired through Sears Holdings accounted for approximately 60% of SHO's merchandise purchases. Although most merchandise purchases are now sourced through Transform Holdco, this percentage decreased from 78% in 2017. We expect this percentage to continue to decline as we increase our direct purchases from other merchandise vendors, particularly as the proportion of SHO's total inventory purchases in the Outlet business continues to increase as expected. 
For example, fourth quarter 2018 purchases from Sears Holdings accounted for 52% of total purchases compared to 74% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 58% in the third quarter of 2018. During the second half of 2017 and in early 2018, we entered into direct purchasing agreements with Whirlpool Corp., Husqvarna, LG Electronics USA Inc., GE Appliances, Samsung Electronics America Inc., and Stanley, Black and Decker. Our Outlet business primarily relies on suppliers other than Transform Holdco for the vast majority of its inventory. For the quarter and year ended February 2, 2019, products that we acquired through Sears Holdings accounted for approximately 10% and 19% of total Outlet purchases, respectively.
As described in greater detail in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report 1A, we have agreements with Transform Holdco as well as with third-party service providers, to provide processing and administrative functions over a broad range of areas.
Our Dealer and Franchise Models
Dealer Model
As of February 2, 2019, 497 of our Hometown Stores were operated by independent authorized dealers who own and operate their stores. The dealer bears responsibility for store operating costs, including all payroll and occupancy costs. SHO provides the inventory to the dealer on a consignment basis, and the dealer earns a variable commission on sales of merchandise, extended-service plans, and other services. SHO also provides support to dealers for recruiting and training dealer staff, marketing, and other support services.
The dealer relationship is governed by a dealer agreement, which generally has either a three or five-year term (depending on its terms and conditions). If a dealer defaults or fails to renew its dealer agreement, SHO may assume responsibility for the operation of the store until a new dealer is recruited to operate the store.
Franchise Model
As of February 2, 2019, 11 of our Home Appliance Showrooms, seven of our Hardware Stores, and five of our Outlet Stores were operated by independent franchisees. Under our primary franchise model, the franchisee operates the store and is responsible for its operating costs, including payroll and leasing costs. SHO provides inventory to the franchisee on a consignment basis, and the franchisee earns variable commissions on sales of merchandise, extended-service plans, and other services. SHO also provides brand and marketing services to the franchisee. In certain cases, SHO remains responsible for lease costs in the case of a default by the franchisees until the expiration of the leases, at which time our franchisees may be required to negotiate new leases to which SHO will not be a party.
6

The franchise relationship is governed by a franchise agreement with each franchisee that generally has a ten-year term and includes the franchisee's right to extend the term for an additional five years subject to the franchisee's satisfaction of renewal conditions that are specified in the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement also currently obligates the franchisee to pay to SHO specified fees, including an initial franchise fee, training fees, transfer fees, and successor franchise fees.
During the second quarter of 2015 we suspended our franchising of additional Hometown and Outlet stores except to existing Company franchisees. We have ceased franchising additional Hometown and Outlet stores.
Distribution and Systems Infrastructure
The majority of our merchandise comes to our stores directly from vendors or distributors (including Transform Holdco). Home delivery is provided by the selling dealers and franchisees, by Transform Holdco, and by other parties.
We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and software systems. We currently rely on Transform Holdco to provide us with the computer systems and infrastructure that enable our distribution systems. See "If we do not maintain the security of our customer, associate, and company information, we could damage our reputation, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation" in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  For information regarding the migration of the current information technology systems and processes provided to us by Holdings to new, business and technology infrastructure and systems see "We rely on Transform Holdco and other third parties to provide us with key products and services in connection with the administration of many critical aspects of our business, and we may be required to develop our own systems quickly in order to reduce such dependence" in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition, we also rely on Transform Holdco for warehousing and other logistics services primarily for our Hometown segment stores.
We are party to a Services Agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of Transform Holdco (as assignee) provides us with a number of services, including logistics and distribution, information technology (including the point-of-sale system used by the Company and our dealers and franchisees), product repair, ecommerce, and payment clearing and other financial services (as amended, the "Services Agreement"). The term of the Services Agreement will expire on February 1, 2023, subject to specified termination rights. We pay fees and rates for the services received in accordance with the Services Agreement. In addition, we are responsible for the payment of all taxes payable in connection with the Services provided under the Services Agreement, including sales, use, excise, value-added, business, service, goods and service, consumption, withholding and other similar taxes or duties. See "Relationships and Transactions with Related Persons" in the definitive 2019 Proxy Statement relating to our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 29, 2019, which is incorporated by reference into Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "2019 Proxy Statement), for a general description of the Services Agreement. 
Geographic Information
The vast majority of our revenues are generated within the United States. During 2018 and 2017, approximately 2.0% of our revenues were generated in Puerto Rico. The vast majority of our long-lived assets are located within the United States.
Employees
As of February 2, 2019, we had 2,992 employees, of which 51% were full-time employees and less than 1% were represented by a union. We believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees and we have never experienced a material interruption of business as a result of labor disputes. We offer a broad range of company-paid benefits to our employees. These company-paid benefits include a 401(k) savings plan, medical and dental plans, disability insurance, paid vacation, various employee assistance programs, life insurance, and merchandise discounts.

Intellectual Property
We are party to several Store License Agreements with a subsidiary of Transform Holdco, as assignee, pursuant to which we have been granted, on a royalty-free basis, among other things, (1) an exclusive, non-transferable and terminable license to operate, and to authorize our dealers and franchisees to operate, retail stores and stores-within-a-store using the "Sears Outlet Store," "Sears Authorized Hometown Store," "Sears Hometown Store," "Sears Home Appliance Showroom," "Sears Hardware Store," and "Sears Appliance & Hardware," store names (together, the "store names"), (2) an exclusive, non-transferable and terminable license to use the store names to promote our products, and services related to our products, by all current and future electronic means, channels, processes and methods, including via the Internet, (3) a non-exclusive, nontransferable and terminable license to use, and to authorize our dealers and franchisees to use, certain other trademarks to market and sell services related to our products under those trademarks and (4) an exclusive, non-transferable and terminable license to use certain domain names in connection with the promotion of our stores, the marketing, distribution and sale of our products and the marketing and offering of services related to our products (collectively, the "Store License Agreements"). We are also party to a Trademark License Agreement with the Transform Holdco subsidiary pursuant to which we have been granted, on a royalty-free basis, a non-exclusive, non-transferable and terminable right to use the "Sears" name in our corporate name and to promote our business (the "Trademark License Agreement"). The Store License Agreements and the Trademark License Agreement will expire in 2029, subject to specified termination rights. For additional information regarding the Store License Agreements and the Trademark License Agreement see "Relationships and Transactions with Related Persons" in the 2019 Proxy Statement.
The Merchandising Agreement provides that (1) Transform Holdco's subsidiary will sell to us, with respect to certain specified product categories, Sears-branded products (including KCD Products) and vendor-branded products obtained from vendors and suppliers and (2) Transform Holdco's subsidiary grants us licenses to use the trademarks owned or licensed by subsidiaries of Transform Holdco (together, the "Sears marks"), including the KCD Marks, in connection with the marketing and sale of products sold under the Sears marks. We pay, on a weekly basis, a royalty determined by multiplying our net sales of the KCD Products by specified fixed royalties rates for each brand’s licensed products.
Seasonality
Our business is not concentrated in the holiday season, as the majority of the products we sell are not typically thought of as holiday gifts. Lawn and garden sales generally peak in our second quarter as customers prepare for and execute outdoor projects during the spring and early summer, although this can vary with weather conditions.
