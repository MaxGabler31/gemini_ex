Overview
We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs in the United States and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment.
Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and internationally in Colombia and, from time to time, we pursue contract drilling opportunities in other select markets. As of December 31, 2021, we had a drilling fleet that consisted of 184 marketed land-based drilling rigs in the United States and eight in Colombia. A drilling rig includes the structure, power source and machinery necessary to cause a drill bit to penetrate the earth to a depth desired by the customer. We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components that support our contract drilling operations.
We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region. Substantially all of the revenue in the pressure pumping segment is from well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. Well stimulation involves processes inside a well designed to enhance the flow of oil, natural gas, or other desired substances from the well. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1.1 million fracturing horsepower to provide these services. We also provide cementing services through the pressure pumping segment. Cementing is the process of inserting material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing. Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment, including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.
We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. Our directional drilling services include directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling and supply and rental of downhole performance motors. We also provide services that improve the statistical accuracy of directional and horizontal wellbores.
 We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States. We also service equipment for drilling contractors, and we provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.

(1)The average oil price represents the average monthly West Texas Intermediate (WTI) spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.
 (2)A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.
 In 2020, reduced demand for crude oil and refined products related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant reduction in crude oil prices and demand for drilling and completion services in the United States.
  Oil prices remain extremely volatile, as the closing price of oil (WTI-Cushing) reached a first quarter 2020 high of $63.27 per barrel on January 6, 2020, declined to negative $36.98 per barrel on April 20, 2020, and recovered to reach a 2021 high of $85.64 per barrel on October 26, 2021. In response to the rapid decline in commodity prices, E&P companies acted swiftly to reduce drilling and completion activity starting late in the first quarter of 2020. While oil prices have recovered in 2021, and demand for our services has improved since the commodity price decline in 2020, our average number of rigs operating remains well below the number of our available rigs, and a portion of our pressure pumping horsepower remains stacked. Oil prices averaged $77.45 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Although our active rig count has not fully recovered to its 2019 levels, it increased in 2021 after significant declines in 2020. Our average active U.S. rig count for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 106 rigs. This was an increase from our average active rig count for the third quarter of 2021 of 80 rigs. The increase was partially due to our acquisition of active U.S. rigs from Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (“Pioneer”), which averaged 13 active rigs during the fourth quarter of 2021. Our active U.S. rig count at December 31, 2021 of 111 rigs was more than the rig count of 65 rigs at December 31, 2020, partially due to the increase in rigs from the Pioneer acquisition and, more significantly, due to the recovery of oil prices and improved demand for drilling services in the United States. Term contracts help support our operating rig count. Based on contracts currently in place in the United States, we expect an average of 51 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter, and an average of 39 rigs operating under term contracts during 2022.
 We ended the fourth quarter of 2021 with 11 active pressure pumping spreads compared to ten at the end of the third quarter. Our average active spread count was approximately ten spreads and effective utilization was close to 11 spreads for the fourth quarter of 2021. We calculated average active spreads as the average number of spreads that were crewed and actively marketed during the period, and we calculated effective utilization as total pumping days during the quarter divided by 75 days, which we consider full effective utilization for a spread for the period. We expect to average approximately 11 active spreads in the first quarter of 2022. The pressure pumping market has improved but remains oversupplied.
 Due to improving activity levels and increasing tightness in the overall labor market, we saw general oilfield cost inflation across our segments during 2021, including increases in the cost of labor, services and supplies. This inflation, combined with the increasing challenge of attracting employees to the industry, is increasing the complexity of reactivating equipment. We believe this challenge, combined with the increasing market tightness for premium drilling and completion services, will support higher pricing for our services in 2022. During 2021, we increased our capital expenditure forecast to approximately $170 million, in part, based on conversations with customers about increasing activity levels into 2022. Actual 2021 capital expenditures excluding discontinued operations totaled $166 million.
 During the second quarter of 2020, we implemented a restructuring plan to improve operating margins, achieve operational efficiencies and reduce indirect support costs. The restructuring included workforce reductions, changes to management structure and facility consolidations and closures.
Recent Developments in Financial Matters and Merger and Acquisition Activity — On October 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (“Pioneer”) by acquiring 100% of its equity interests. Total consideration for the acquisition included the issuance of approximately 26.3 million shares of our common stock and payment of $30 million cash, which based on the closing price of our common stock of $9.44 on October 1, 2021, valued the transaction at approximately $278 million.
Pioneer provided land-based contract drilling services and production services to a diverse group of oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and internationally in Colombia. Through the Pioneer acquisition, we acquired Pioneer’s 100% pad-capable drilling rig fleet consisting of 17 AC-powered rigs in the United States and eight SCR rigs in Colombia and production services assets consisting of 123 well servicing rigs and 72 wireline services units. We believe the acquisition of Pioneer enhances our position as a leading provider of contract drilling services in the United States and expands our geographic footprint into Latin America.

On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of the acquired well servicing rig business and wireline business (collectively, “Pioneer Production Services”), to Clearwell Dynamics, LLC (“Clearwell”). The sale price was $43.0 million in cash consideration, subject to customary purchase price adjustments at closing for cash and working capital. The results of operations of these businesses have been presented as a discontinued operation in these consolidated financial statements. In connection with the sale of our Pioneer Production Services business, we entered into a transition services agreement with Clearwell, pursuant to which we agreed to provide each other certain administrative and operational services on an interim, transitional basis through June 30, 2022.
 On December 30, 2021, we repaid the final $50 million of borrowings under the 2019 Term Loan Agreement (“Term Loan Agreement”), and as a result had no remaining borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2021.
 Industry Segments
 Our revenues, operating loss and identifiable assets are primarily attributable to three industry segments:
•contract drilling services, 
 •pressure pumping services, and
 •directional drilling services. 
 Our contract drilling services, pressure pumping services, and directional drilling services industry segments had operating losses in 2021, 2020 and 2019.
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Items 7 and 8, respectively, of this Report for financial information pertaining to these industry segments.
Contract Drilling Operations
General — We market our contract drilling services to oil and natural gas operators in the United States and Colombia. As of December 31, 2021, we had 192 marketed land-based drilling rigs based in the following regions:

Region | Number of Rigs | 
West Texas | | 73 
Appalachia | | 33 
Rockies | | 24 
Oklahoma | | 20 
South Texas | | 19 
East Texas | | 15 
Colombia | | 8 
Total | | 192

 All of these drilling rigs are electric rigs. An electric rig converts the power from its diesel engines into electricity to power the rig. The U.S. land rig industry has in recent years referred to certain high specification rigs as “super-spec” rigs, which we consider to be at least a 1,500 horsepower, AC-powered rig that has at least a 750,000-pound hookload, a 7,500-psi circulating system, and is pad-capable. We have 171 super-spec rigs in total.
Due to evolving customer preferences, we have begun to refer to certain premium rigs as “Tier-1, super-spec” rigs, which we consider as being a super-spec rig that also has a third mud pump and raised drawworks that allow for more clearance underneath the rig floor. We currently estimate there are fewer than 400 Tier-1, super-spec rigs in the United States, which includes our 107 Tier-1, super-spec rigs.
We also have a substantial inventory of drill pipe and drilling rig components, which may be used in the activation of additional drilling rigs or as upgrades or replacement parts for marketed rigs.

Drilling rigs are typically equipped with engines, drawworks, top drives, masts, pumps to circulate the drilling fluid, blowout preventers, drill pipe and other related equipment. Over time, components on a drilling rig are replaced or rebuilt. We spend significant funds each year as part of a program to modify, upgrade and maintain our drilling rigs. To address our customers’ needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays, we have improved the capability of our drilling fleet during the last several years. Over the years, we have made performance and safety improvements to our rig fleet. Our APEX® rigs are AC-powered electric rigs with many having high pressure mud systems, walking systems and increased hookload capacity. We have spent approximately $409 million during the last three years on capital expenditures to modify, upgrade and extend the lives of components of our drilling fleet. During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, we spent approximately $110 million, $105 million and $194 million, respectively, on these capital expenditures.
Depth and complexity of the well, drill site conditions and the number of wells to be drilled on a pad are the principal factors in determining the specifications of the rig selected for a particular job.
Our contract drilling operations depend on the availability of drill pipe, drill bits, replacement parts and other related rig equipment, fuel and other materials and qualified personnel. Some of these have been in short supply from time to time.
We perform repair and/or upgrade work to our drilling rig equipment at our yard facilities located in Texas, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and internationally in Colombia.
Drilling Contracts — Most of our drilling contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Our bid for each job depends upon location, equipment to be used, estimated risks involved, estimated duration of the job, availability of drilling rigs and other factors particular to each proposed contract. Our drilling contracts are generally either on a well-to-well basis or a term basis. Well-to-well contracts are generally short-term in nature and cover the drilling of a single well or a series of wells. Term contracts are entered into for a specified period of time (we define term contracts as contracts with a duration of six months or more) or for a specified number of wells.
Our drilling contracts obligate us to provide and operate a drilling rig and to pay certain operating expenses, including wages of our drilling personnel and necessary maintenance expenses. Most drilling contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice and may or may not contain provisions for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer.
Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a daywork basis, pursuant to which we provide the drilling rig and crew to the customer. The customer provides the program for the drilling of the well. Our compensation is based on a contracted rate per day during the period the drilling rig is utilized. We often receive a lower rate when the drilling rig is moving or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. Daywork contracts typically provide separately for mobilization of the drilling rig.
Contract Drilling Activity — Information regarding our contract drilling activity for the last three years follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Average rigs operating per day - U.S. (1) | | 82 | | 82 | | 149 
Number of rigs operated during the year - U.S. | | 118 | | 131 | | 186 
Number of wells drilled during the year - U.S. | | 1,662 | | 1,324 | | 2,690 
Number of operating days - U.S. | | 29,960 | | 29,857 | | 54,282

 
(1)A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day. 
 Rig Fleet Evaluation — On a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring inactive rigs to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type. The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment. The remaining components of these rigs are retired. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified 43 legacy, non-super-spec rigs and equipment to be abandoned. Based on the strong customer preference across the industry for super-spec drilling rigs, we believed the 43 rigs that were abandoned had limited commercial opportunity. We recorded a $220 million charge related to this abandonment in the fourth quarter of 2021.

Drilling Technology — We continue to enhance the technology offerings that can be used with our drilling operations. Our proprietary operating system for APEX® drilling rigs, Cortex®, can allow for the deployment of custom applications for rig performance, control and optimization. For instance, our GenAssist application can employ smart engine logic turning engines on and off to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Our Cortex® Key edge server can connect to various systems at the well site, streaming large data sets and providing a single, high-speed data aggregation source. Our EcoCell lithium battery hybrid energy management system is capable of utilizing stored energy to help reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
 Pressure Pumping Operations
General — We provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators, primarily in Texas and the Appalachian region (Northeast Region). Pressure pumping services consist primarily of well stimulation services (such as hydraulic fracturing) for the completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. Wells drilled in shale formations and other unconventional plays require well stimulation through hydraulic fracturing to allow the flow of oil and natural gas. This is accomplished by pumping fluids and proppant under pressure into the well bore to fracture the formation. Many wells in conventional plays also receive well stimulation services. We also provide cementing services through the pressure pumping segment. The cementing process inserts material between the wall of the well bore and the casing to support and stabilize the casing. The scope and impact of our cementing services were insignificant during the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Pressure Pumping Contracts — Our pressure pumping operations are conducted pursuant to a work order for a specific job or pursuant to a term contract. The term contracts are generally entered into for a specified period of time and may include minimum revenue, usage or stage requirements. We are compensated based on a combination of charges for equipment, personnel, materials, mobilization and other items.
Equipment — We have pressure pumping equipment used in providing hydraulic fracturing services as well as cementing and acid pumping services, with a total of approximately 1.1 million horsepower as of December 31, 2021. Pressure pumping equipment at December 31, 2021 included:

 | | | Other | | 
 | Fracturing | | Pumping | | 
 | Equipment | | Equipment | | Total
Texas Region | | | | | 
Number of units | | 355 | | 12 | | 367 
Approximate horsepower | | 847,500 | | 14,280 | | 861,780 
Northeast Region | | | | | 
Number of units | | 121 | | 9 | | 130 
Approximate horsepower | | 281,900 | | 5,800 | | 287,700 
Combined: | | | | | 
Number of units | | 476 | | 21 | | 497 
Approximate horsepower | | 1,129,400 | | 20,080 | | 1,149,480

 
Our pressure pumping operations are supported by a fleet of other equipment including blenders, tractors, manifold trailers and numerous trailers for transportation of materials to and from the worksite, as well as bins for storage of materials at the worksite.

We periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets for marketability based on the condition of inactive equipment, expenditures that would be necessary to bring the equipment to working condition and the expected demand for such equipment. The components of equipment that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility will be used as parts to support active equipment. The remaining components of this equipment are retired. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a charge of $32.2 million related to the abandonment of approximately 0.2 million horsepower within our pressure pumping fleet. The majority of these units were frac pumps but also included pump down units. These units were abandoned due to changes in customer preferences for dual fuel, advancements in technology, and prohibitive reactivation costs.
 
Materials — Our pressure pumping operations require the use of acids, chemicals, proppants, fluid supplies and other materials, any of which can be in short supply, including severe shortages, from time to time. We purchase these materials from various suppliers. These purchases are made in the spot market or pursuant to other arrangements that may not cover all of our required supply. These supply arrangements sometimes require us to purchase the supply or pay liquidated damages if we do not purchase the material. Given the limited number of suppliers of certain of our materials, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements if we are unable to reach an agreement with a supplier for delivery of any particular material or should one of our suppliers, including trucking companies, fail to timely deliver our materials.

Directional Drilling Operations
 General — We generally utilize our own proprietary downhole motors and equipment to provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and supply and rental of downhole performance motors, in most major onshore oil and natural gas basins in the United States. We generally design, assemble and maintain our own fleet of downhole drilling motors and MWD equipment. Our customers primarily consist of oil and natural gas operators in the United States. We believe our customers use our services because of the quality of our specialized, technology-driven equipment and our well-trained and experienced workforce, which enable us to provide our customers with high-quality, reliable and safe directional drilling services.
Directional Drilling Services — We provide our directional drilling services primarily on a dayrate basis, typically under master service agreements. Revenue from directional drilling services is recognized as work progresses based on the number of days or footage completed. Our rates and other charges generally vary by location and depend on the equipment and personnel required for the job and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed. In addition to rates that are charged during periods of active directional drilling, a standby rate is typically agreed upon in advance and charged on a daily basis during periods when drilling is temporarily suspended while other on-site activity is conducted at the direction of the operator or another service provider.
Equipment — We generally design, assemble, maintain and inspect our own equipment. We have developed proprietary equipment for our drilling motors, mud pulse and electromagnetic data transfer MWD equipment. We believe that our vertical integration strategy allows us to deliver better operational performance and higher equipment reliability to our customers. Vertical integration also allows us to build our tools more efficiently and at a lower cost than if purchased from third parties. In addition, we have the ability to upgrade our tools in response to market conditions or our customers’ job requirements, which allows us to minimize the costs and delays associated with sending equipment to original manufacturers. Our internal maintenance capability also affords us enhanced control over our supply chain and increases the effective utilization of our assets.
 We periodically evaluate our directional drilling assets. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we abandoned certain directional drilling equipment totaling $2.5 million and recorded a charge on our developed technology intangible asset of $11.4 million due to advances in technology that rendered those assets, and their related spare parts inventory, obsolete. The inventory write-down in 2021 totaled $4.0 million.
Wellbore Placement Optimization Services — We provide software and services used to improve the accuracy of directional and horizontal wellbores, wellbore quality, and on-bottom ROP (rate of penetration). Our measurement-while-drilling (MWD) Survey FDIR (fault detection, isolation and recovery) service is a data analytics technology to analyze MWD survey data in real-time and more accurately identify the position of a well. Our HiFi Nav offering enhances FDIR by targeting improved vertical placement of the directional well within the reservoir. Our HiFi Guidance service utilizes trajectory optimization to determine optimal steering recommendation placement within the reservoir, targeting minimal sliding, faster ROP, and a higher percentage of the wellbore placed in the desired drilling window. We provide these services to customers with onshore and offshore operations.
Other Operations
 Our oilfield rentals business has a fleet of premium rental tools and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities in many of the major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. We service equipment for drilling contractors, and we provide electrical controls and automation to the energy, marine and mining industries in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.
Contracts
 We believe that our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling and other contracts generally provide for indemnification rights and obligations that are customary for the markets in which we conduct those operations. However, each contract contains the actual terms setting forth our rights and obligations and those of the customer or supplier, any of which rights and obligations may deviate from what is customary due to particular industry conditions, customer or supplier requirements, applicable law or other factors.
 Customers
Our customer base includes major, independent and other oil and natural gas operators. With respect to our consolidated operating revenues in 2021, we received approximately 57% from our ten largest customers and approximately 39% from our five largest customers. During 2021, one customer accounted for approximately $216 million, or approximately 16%, of our consolidated operating revenues. These revenues were earned in both our contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. The loss of, or reduction in business from, one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
Backlog
 Our contract drilling backlog in the United States as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $325 million and $301 million, respectively. Approximately 22% of our contract drilling backlog in the United States at December 31, 2021 is reasonably expected to remain after 2022. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included as a part of Item 7 of this Report for information pertaining to backlog.
Competition
The businesses in which we operate are highly competitive. Historically, available equipment used in our contract drilling, pressure pumping and directional drilling businesses has frequently exceeded demand, particularly in an industry downturn. The price for our services is a key competitive factor, in part because equipment used in these businesses can be moved from one area to another in response to market conditions. In addition to price, we believe availability, condition and technical specifications of equipment (including emission reduction capabilities), quality of personnel, service quality and safety record are key factors in determining which contractor is awarded a job. We expect that the market for our services will continue to be highly competitive.
Human Capital and Sustainability
 We strive to be a leader in our industry in the area of environmental, social, governance and other sustainability-related issues, and we remain committed to managing these issues for the long-term benefit of our employees, communities and our business. We aim to minimize our environmental impact in the communities in which we work and live, while providing services for our customers in a safe and responsible manner. We invest extensively in the safety, health and well-being of our people, who are our most important asset and our greatest strength. Importantly, we maintain a rigorous focus on ethics and integrity at every level of our operations, a practice on which all of our success depends.
We encourage you to review our latest Sustainability Report, located on our website, for more detailed information regarding our Sustainability and Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our Sustainability Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Report or other filings that we make with the SEC.
 Environment – We continue to pursue initiatives to mitigate climate change risk and make improvements in air quality, water quality, land usage, use of energy and reducing waste materials. For example, we utilize natural gas engines, dual-fuel equipment and other technologies that reduce our carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and we employ spill prevention plans and use additional protective measures in environmentally sensitive areas.
We have strengthened our position as a leader in alternative fuel technology with the commercialization of our EcoCell lithium battery hybrid energy management system. EcoCell is capable of efficiently displacing one of the gensets on a drilling rig to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions. The value of this technology is enhanced when used in combination with our Cortex® power management system and our dual-fuel engines, as the natural gas substitution rate can be optimized.
Through our Current Power business, we provide in-house electrical engineering, control system automation and installation services to connect drilling rigs to utility electrical lines. This capability enables our customers to use utility power, instead of natural gas or diesel fuel, to power drilling operations. Using utility power is an optimal power solution for our drilling rigs as it minimizes emission impacts at the wellsite.
Some of our key human capital areas of focus include:
 Employees – We had approximately 5,000 full-time employees as of January 31, 2022. The number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. We consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a union. Although some of our Colombian employees may be union members, we have not entered into any collective bargaining arrangements with the unions with which those employees are affiliated.
Training and Safety – Our training programs include opportunities for employees to advance in their professional careers through intensive, multi-day classroom training programs in numerous skills and competencies as well as management training programs. These programs are geared to providing our employees with opportunities to advance throughout our company.
The safety of our employees and others is our highest priority, as our goal is to provide an incident-free work environment. We have robust safety training programs in place that are designed to comply with applicable laws and industry standards and to benefit our employees, communities and our business. All U.S. field-based employees are required to have safety education on an annual basis which incorporates learning associated with hazard awareness, safe systems of work, permission to work, time out for safety, energy isolation, material handling and management of change.


In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented, and continue to maintain, safety protocols at our offices, facilities and worksites. These protocols include allowing many of our office-based employees to work from home.
 Diversity, Inclusion and Respect – We are committed to fostering a work environment where all people feel valued and respected. We embrace our diversity of people, thoughts and talents, and combine these strengths to pursue extraordinary results for our company, our employees and our stockholders. We are committed to recruiting, hiring and retaining the highest caliber talent for our business by utilizing outreach initiatives and partnerships with a diverse group of organizations, industry associations and networks.
 We require new supervisors and managers in the United States to attend an instructor-led course relative to diversity, inclusion and respect to ensure they understand our expectations regarding their obligations to promote a work environment where all employees are valued and respected. Supplemental diversity, inclusion and respect training for supervisors and managers is required on a biannual basis. All other employees are educated on our commitment to a respectful workplace for all to ensure they understand their role as they engage with co-workers.
Maintaining our Core Values – In 2021, we trained over 3,500 employees on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which addresses conflicts of interest, confidentiality, fair dealing with others, proper use of company assets, compliance with laws, insider trading, keeping of books and records, zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment in the work environment, as well as reporting of violations.
Health and Benefits – Our health and benefits program provides for extensive preventative care and is designed to improve our employees’ fitness for work, personal safety on the job and overall well-being.

However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material, and we could incur liability in any instance of noncompliance.
Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations that relate to the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of laws, rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase costs relating to drilling, completion and production, delay the permitting of, or related to, such operations, restrict or prohibit oil and gas development in certain areas, reduce the demand for oil and natural gas and otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations or business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Federal, state, foreign, regional and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including laws, rules, regulations and executive actions related to the mitigation of climate change or greenhouse gas emissions, currently apply to our operations and are likely to become more stringent in the future. Any limitation, suspension or moratorium of the services and products we or others provide, whether or not short-term in nature, by a federal, state, foreign, regional or local governmental authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We believe we use operating and disposal practices that are standard in the industry. However, hydrocarbons and other materials may have been disposed of, or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors, which may have resulted, or may result, in soil and groundwater contamination in certain locations. Any contamination found on, under or originating from the properties may be subject to remediation requirements under federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control of their treatment of hydrocarbon and other materials or the manner in which they may have disposed of or released such materials. We could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. In addition, it is possible we could be held responsible for oil and natural gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator.
Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that may govern our operations.
In the United States, the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
•owners and operators of sites, including prior owners and operators who are no longer active at a site; and 
 •persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at sites. 
 The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), as amended, and comparable state statutes and implementing regulations govern the disposal of “hazardous wastes.” Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from the definition of “hazardous substances,” and RCRA also excludes certain classes of exploration and production wastes from regulation, such exemptions may be deleted, limited, or modified in the future. For example, in December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking by March 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. The EPA issued a report on April 23, 2019, determining that no revisions were necessary. However, if changes are made to the classification of exploration and production wastes under CERCLA and/or RCRA in the future, we could be required to remove and remediate previously disposed of materials (including materials disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) from properties (including ground water contaminated with hydrocarbons) and to perform removal or remedial actions to prevent future contamination.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “Oil Pollution Act”), each as amended, and implementing regulations govern:
•the prevention and permitting of discharges, including oil and produced water spills, into jurisdictional waters; and 
 •liability for drainage into such waters. 
 The Oil Pollution Act imposes strict liability for a comprehensive and expansive list of damages from an oil spill into jurisdictional waters from facilities. Liability may be imposed for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Penalties may also be imposed for violation of federal safety, construction and operating regulations, and for failure to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up.
The Oil Pollution Act also expands the authority and capability of the federal government to direct and manage oil spill clean-up and operations, and requires operators to prepare oil spill response plans in cases where it can reasonably be expected that substantial harm will be done to the environment by discharges on or into navigable waters. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill event may subject a responsible party, such as us, to civil or criminal actions. Although the liability for owners and operators is the same under the Clean Water Act, the damages recoverable under the Oil Pollution Act are potentially much greater and can include natural resource damages.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) promulgates and enforces laws and regulations governing the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governments and citizens. Also, OSHA has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety.

Our activities include the performance of hydraulic fracturing services to enhance the production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability, such as shale and other unconventional formations. Due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. Certain politicians have also vocalized support for a nationwide ban on hydraulic fracturing. Additional legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. These developments could also lead to litigation challenging proposed or existing wells. Such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the hydraulic fracturing services that we provide for our exploration and production customers, and such efforts could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Potential Legislation and Regulation Covering Hydraulic Fracturing or Other Aspects of the Oil and Gas Industry Could Increase Our Costs and Limit or Delay Our Operations.”
Other jurisdictions where we may conduct operations have similar environmental and regulatory regimes with which we would be required to comply. These laws, rules and regulations also require that facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, new projects or changes to existing projects may require the submission and approval of environmental assessments or permit applications. These laws, rules and regulations are subject to frequent change, and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment.
Our operations are also subject to federal, state, foreign, regional and local laws, rules and regulations for the control of air emissions, including those associated with the Federal Clean Air Act. We and our customers may be required to make capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We are also subject to regulation by numerous other regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees employment practice standards.
 For more information, please refer to our discussion under “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Laws and Regulations, Including Violations Thereof, Could Materially Adversely Affect Our Operating Results.”
There has been an increasing focus of local, state, national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and climate change issues. There has also been legislation proposed by U.S. lawmakers to reduce GHG emissions, as well as GHG emissions regulations enacted by the EPA, and future federal action to address climate change is likely.

President Biden and the Democratic Party, which controls Congress, have identified climate change as a priority, and it is likely that additional executive orders, regulatory action, and/or legislation targeting greenhouse gas emissions, or prohibiting, delaying or restricting oil and gas development activities in certain areas, will be proposed and/or promulgated during the Biden Administration. For example, the acting Secretary of the Department of the Interior recently issued an order preventing staff from producing any new fossil fuel leases or permits without sign-off from a top political appointee, and President Biden recently announced a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of Federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. President Biden’s order also established climate change as a primary foreign policy and national security consideration, affirms that achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or before midcentury is a critical priority, affirms the Biden Administration’s desire to establish the United States as a leader in addressing climate change, generally further integrates climate change and environmental justice considerations into government agencies’ decision-making, and eliminates fossil fuel subsidies, among other measures. Although a federal judge for the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the pause of oil and natural gas leasing on public lands or in offshore waters while litigation challenging that aspect of the executive order is ongoing, the Biden Administration may take other regulatory steps in the future that could impact our operations.
 
In February 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, and in the future, the United States may also choose to adhere to other international agreements targeting GHG reductions. In April 2021, President Biden set a new goal for the United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net greenhouse gas pollution in 2030. Further, in November 2021, the Unites States and other countries entered into the Glasgow Climate Pact, which includes a range of measures designed to address climate change, including but not limited to the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies, reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and cooperating toward the advancement of the development of clean energy.
 
Several states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs, including cap and trade regimes and commitments to contribute to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.

We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our and Our Customers’ Operations are Subject to a Number of Risks Arising Out of the Threat of Climate Change That Could Result in Increased Operating and Capital Costs, Limit the Areas in Which Oil and Natural Gas Production May Occur and Reduce Demand for Our Services.”
Risks and Insurance
Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the businesses in which we operate, including inclement weather, blowouts, explosions, fires, loss of well control, motor vehicle accidents, pollution, exposure and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause personal injury or death, work stoppage, and serious damage to equipment and other property, as well as significant environmental and reservoir damages. These risks could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and natural gas production, pollution and other environmental damages. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.
 We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers, and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our contracts typically contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, reservoir and certain pollution damage. Our right to indemnification may, however, be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts or omissions by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers and other third parties may dispute, or be unable to meet, their indemnification obligations to us due to financial, legal or other reasons. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our customers and other third parties by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
 We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, but we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The insurance coverage that we maintain includes insurance for fire, windstorm and other risks of physical loss to our equipment and certain other assets, employer’s liability, automobile liability, commercial general liability, workers’ compensation and insurance for other specific risks. We cannot assure, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities, or that this insurance will continue to be available, or available on terms that are acceptable to us. While we carry insurance to cover physical damage to, or loss of, a substantial portion of our equipment and certain other assets, such insurance does not cover the full replacement cost of such equipment or other assets. We have also elected in some cases to accept a greater amount of risk through increased deductibles on certain insurance policies. For example, in the United States we generally maintain a $1.5 million per occurrence deductible on our workers’ compensation insurance coverage, a $1.0 million per occurrence deductible on our equipment insurance coverage, a $10.0 million per occurrence deductible on our general liability coverage, a $2.0 million per occurrence deductible on our primary automobile liability insurance coverage, and a $5.0 million per occurrence deductible on our excess automobile liability insurance coverage. We also self-insure a number of other risks, including loss of earnings and business interruption and most cybersecurity risks, and we do not carry a significant amount of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.
Our insurance may not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits and exclusions. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits or that is otherwise excluded from our coverage. There can be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of our operational risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive, or that our coverage will cover a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers or such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully insured or indemnified could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable and recoverable indemnity from a third party, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our Operations Are Subject to a Number of Operational Risks, Including Environmental and Weather Risks, Which Could Expose Us to Significant Losses and Damage Claims. We Are Not Fully Insured Against All of These Risks and Our Contractual Indemnity Provisions May Not Fully Protect Us.”
Seasonality
Seasonality has not significantly affected our overall operations. Toward the end of calendar years, we experience slower activity in connection with the holidays and as customers’ capital expenditure budgets are depleted. Occasionally, our operations have been negatively impacted by severe weather conditions.
Raw Materials and Subcontractors
We use many suppliers of raw materials and services. Although these materials and services have historically been available, there is no assurance that such materials and services will continue to be available on favorable terms or at all. We also utilize numerous independent subcontractors from various trades.
