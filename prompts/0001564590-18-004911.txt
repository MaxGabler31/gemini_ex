Item 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our lead product candidate, entinostat is a once-weekly, oral, small molecule, Class I HDAC inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with exemestane for advanced hormone receptor positive, or HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, or HER2-, breast cancer, an indication for which it has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. Entinostat has been shown to block the function of immune suppressive cells in the tumor microenvironment, and is being evaluated in combination with several approved PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists, including in ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trials combining entinostat with Keytruda® from Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and colorectal cancer; with Tecentriq® from Genentech, Inc. for triple negative breast cancer as well as advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; and with Bavencio® from Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for ovarian cancer.
Our second clinical stage product candidate, SNDX-6352, is a monoclonal antibody that targets the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. In many cancers, inhibition of CSF-1R will reduce the number of immunosuppressive TAMs and enable an immune response against tumors.  We believe SNDX-6352 can provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients in one or more tumor types given its ability to enhance the body’s immune response against tumors that have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy. We commenced a Phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients during the third quarter of 2017. 
 We are also developing a portfolio of preclinical, orally-available, small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of Menin with the Mixed Lineage Leukemia, or MLL, protein, which we refer to as the Menin Assets, to potentially treat a genetically-defined subset of acute leukemias with chromosomal rearrangements in the MLL gene, or MLL-r.
 We plan to continue to leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are developing entinostat, SNDX-6352 and the Menin Assets for use in multiple cancer and potentially other indications in combination with complementary therapeutic drugs and potentially as single agents. Key elements of our strategy include: 

• | Develop and obtain regulatory approval for entinostat in combination with hormone therapy in advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Based on the positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, we received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for entinostat in combination with exemestane in advanced HR+ breast cancer. We believe that the submission of the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial, if successful, would be sufficient for regulatory approval of entinostat in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish entinostat as the combination therapy of choice with immune checkpoint inhibitors, initially PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, by conducting clinical trials in patients where we believe the response to PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors can be improved. To that end, we have entered into non-exclusive collaborations with Merck, Genentech, and Merck KGaA and Pfizer. We intend to expand the existing collaborations or enter into additional collaborations through additional non-exclusive, clinical development agreements to assess entinostat’s impact across multiple tumor types while maintaining our ownership rights.

• | Develop SNDX-6352 as monotherapy and in combination in one or more tumor types. We intend to conduct clinical trials in patients with tumor types where we believe that the inhibition of TAMs via CSF-1R inhibition will synergize with the current standard of care, inducing tumor regressions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop the Menin Assets for the treatment of MLL-r driven malignancies. We believe that the Menin Assets have the potential to treat a genetically-defined subset of acute leukemias with chromosomal rearrangements in the MLL gene, or MLL-r. We are conducting preclinical studies in 2018 and plan to file an IND in the first half of 2019.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. We acquired the exclusive rights to SNDX-6352 in 2016 and to the Menin Assets in 2017. We intend to continue leveraging the collective talent within our organization and network of advisors to guide our pipeline expansion and development plans.

Our Pipeline

Entinostat 
 Entinostat is our oral, small molecule product candidate that has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, potentially enhancing the body’s immune response to tumors. The favorable safety profile of entinostat has been demonstrated in clinical trials in more than 1,200 cancer patients. Based on entinostat’s ability to reverse hormone resistance, alter cancer stem cells, and modulate immunosensitivity, we believe entinostat may have broad applications in tumor types which have become resistant to hormone and/or immunotherapy.
 Entinostat is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial testing exemestane in combination with entinostat versus exemestane in combination with a placebo in patients with advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer. ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, or ECOG-ACRIN, is conducting this clinical trial under sponsorship and funding support from the National Cancer Institute, or NCI. We are providing financial and operational support for this Phase 3 clinical trial under separate agreements with the NCI and ECOG-ACRIN. The protocol for the Phase 3 clinical trial was reviewed and agreed upon by the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the NCI. The Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to determine whether the addition of entinostat to exemestane improves progression-free survival, or PFS, overall survival, or OS, or both in patients who have previously progressed after treatment with standard-of-care hormonal agents. We believe that the submission of the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial, if successful, would be sufficient for regulatory approval of entinostat in the United States. 
 Entinostat has also been shown to enhance the immune system’s ability to identify and target tumor cells. It is now widely accepted that many tumors have the ability to evade the immune system either through direct cellular interactions and recruitment of immuno-suppressive cells to the area surrounding the tumor, or through parallel evasion-mechanisms focused on the interaction between the T cell with other immune cells found within the surrounding tumor microenvironment. Entinostat has been observed to decrease the population of immuno-suppressive cells known as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, and regulatory T cells, or Tregs, which localize in the area surrounding the tumor and block T cells from killing cancer cells. 
 We believe entinostat, a Class I-specific histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor, can directly reduce both the number and activity of MDSCs and Tregs while sparing the cytotoxic T cells. Through blocking the immuno-suppressive effects of MDSCs and Tregs, we believe entinostat has the potential to be used synergistically with therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, resulting in the increased ability of the T cells to attack the tumor. The long half-life of entinostat allows for continuous exposure to therapy potentially resulting in positive immuno-modulatory effects without corresponding cytotoxic effects. Another benefit of entinostat’s long half-life is the potential to minimize the frequency of dosing and reduce the severity and frequency of adverse events. 
 SNDX-6352 
 SNDX-6352 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to CSF-1R. CSF-1R is expressed on the surface of specific immuno-suppressive cells (e.g., tumor-associated macrophages or TAMs) known to play a role in the growth, survival, and metastases of cancer. Inhibition of CSF-1R is thought to disrupt the activity of TAMs, resulting in a decrease in the immunosuppressive environment immediately surrounding the tumor, or tumor micro-environment. This mode of action is thought to make CSF-1R inhibitors well suited for use in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in cancers where there may be limited activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy. We believe that SNDX-6352 has the potential to be used to treat a variety of cancers in combination with entinostat and with other oncology agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, radiation, and chemotherapy.
 
Clinical Development Programs
 Entinostat
 Cancer is a complex, often fatal, disease arising from uncontrolled cell growth and the ability of cancer cells to avoid the immune system, the body’s primary defense mechanism for finding and destroying such cells. Entinostat is an oral, small molecule HDAC inhibitor. HDACs are enzymes that are subdivided into four classes and are known to play a role in controlling cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and immunity. While most HDAC inhibitors broadly inhibit multiple classes of HDACs, preclinical studies have shown that entinostat’s inhibitory activity is selective to Class I HDACs, which have been shown to impact the number and activity of MDSCs and Tregs. We believe that entinostat’s Class I selectivity enhances immune responses against cancer and is likely to be better tolerated by patients.

Entinostat in Advanced HR+ Breast Cancer 
 Market Overview and Current Treatment 
 Patients in the United States with advanced HR+ breast cancer are treated with hormone therapies with the goal to prolong overall survival and to delay treatment with more toxic chemotherapies. Hormone therapies are designed to inhibit estrogen stimulation of advanced HR+ breast cancers. Due to limited efficacy of hormone therapies in the advanced HR+ breast cancer setting, multiple lines of treatment are typically used, with each additional line of hormone therapy resulting in a shorter progression free survival, or PFS, and lower overall survival. The cause of resistance is multi-factorial and results in tumor progression independent of estrogen stimulation. In 2016, approximately 34,000 patients with HR+ breast cancer were treated with a hormone therapy as second-line or later treatment in the United States. The median overall survival for advanced HR+ breast cancer in the second-line setting is approximately two years.
 The FDA has approved the use of Afinitor® (everolimus), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, for use in combination with exemestane, based on a randomized Phase 3 clinical trial which resulted in a median PFS benefit of 7.8 months for patients receiving Afinitor-exemestane and 3.2 months for patients receiving exemestane alone, but no statistically significant improvement in overall survival. 
 More recently, the FDA granted approval to three cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, inhibitors, Ibrance® (palbociclib), Kisqali® (ribociclib) and Verzenio® (abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with metastatic disease. Based on the significant PFS benefit observed in combination with endocrine therapy, these agents have been adopted as standard of care treatment, with patients increasingly receiving a CDK4/6 therapy in the front-line setting.
 While the treatment of advanced HR+ breast cancer is evolving given the introduction of multiple combination therapies, we believe physicians will welcome the introduction of a well-tolerated therapy that improves overall survival, which has not been demonstrated to date for Afinitor or the CDK 4/6 inhibitors in combination with hormone therapy. We believe current data suggests that entinostat could demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile and an improvement in overall survival, and thus may become a preferred treatment option for patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer who have stopped responding to their first line endocrine-based regimen. 
 Our Development of Entinostat in Advanced HR+ Breast Cancer 
 Estrogen drives the growth of breast cancer cells that express estrogen receptor and are dependent on estrogen receptor signaling. Blocking estrogen from binding to the estrogen receptor with selective estrogen receptor modulators or selective estrogen receptor degraders or reducing the level of available estrogen with aromatase inhibitors is an effective approach to slowing the growth of estrogen dependent breast cancer cells. These approaches become less effective over time as the breast cancer adapts ways to grow without the need for estrogen due in part to the use of alternate, estrogen independent growth signaling pathways and loss of estrogen receptor expression. Researchers using a preclinical mouse model of aromatase inhibitor resistance demonstrated that entinostat can restore sensitivity to aromatase inhibitors by inhibiting the estrogen independent growth factor signaling pathways and increasing estrogen receptor expression.
 We completed a Phase 2b clinical trial, ENCORE 301, of entinostat in advanced HR+ breast cancer in 130 postmenopausal patients. The trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in which treatment with entinostat was observed to result in a significant advantage to patients when given in addition to exemestane therapy. Postmenopausal patients with advanced HR+ breast cancer progressing on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor were randomly assigned to the combination of exemestane (25 mg daily) and entinostat (5 mg once per week) or to the combination of exemestane (25 mg daily) and a placebo. The primary endpoint was PFS, with overall survival as an exploratory endpoint. 
 A Kaplan-Meier plot is a graphical statistical method commonly used to describe survival characteristics. The following are explanations of the meanings of the various efficacy endpoints that we have used in describing the results of our Phase 2b clinical trial. Each is determined in accordance with Response Criteria in Solid Tumors measurement guidelines.

• | P-value: a statistical measure that represents the probability that the difference that is observed between two treatment arms is due to random chance and is not actually related to the treatments being compared. For example, p-value of 0.1 indicates there is a 10% chance the difference that is observed between the treatment arms is due to random chance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Confidence interval: a statistical measure that indicates a range, which is believed to include the true effect parameter with some level of confidence. For example, a 95% CI is the range at which one is 95% sure, with a 5% chance of being wrong, that the range given includes the true effect parameter.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hazard ratio: represents the chance of events occurring in the treatment arm relative to the chance of events occurring in the control arm. A hazard ratio of one means that there is no difference in survival between the two groups. A hazard ratio of greater than one or less than one means that survival was better in one of the groups.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The trial met the statistical criteria for a positive PFS endpoint using a pre-specified p-value of 0.10 from a one-sided test for statistical significance. The overall survival benefit observed in the entinostat/exemestane (EE) group was also statistically significant versus the exemestane/placebo (EP) group. The results are summarized below along with the Kaplan-Meier plot for PFS and overall survival. 
  
• | Median PFS approximately doubled to 4.3 months in the EE group versus 2.3 months in the EP group, corresponding to a statistically significant hazard ratio of 0.73; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.07; P2-sided=0.11; P1-sided=0.055.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Median overall survival improved to 28.1 months in the EE group versus 19.8 months in the EP group, corresponding to a statistically significant hazard ratio of 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97; P2-sided=0.036; P1-sided=0.018.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fatigue and neutropenia were the most frequent Grade 3 and Grade 4 toxicities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety was assessed by utilizing the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events—Version 3. When entinostat was added to exemestane, the adverse event, or AE, profile was consistent with previous clinical experience with entinostat treatment. Overall, the EE group had a higher rate of AEs versus the EP group at 95% and 85%, respectively, with the most common AEs in the EE group being fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and hematologic toxicities, such as uncomplicated neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia. The EE group had more AEs leading to dose modification (35% versus 6%), and more AEs leading to study discontinuation (11% versus 2%), irrespective of study drug relationship. 
 5


For hematological toxicities, thrombocytopenia was managed by dose modification during entinostat treatment, with all cases being non-severe and none requiring drug discontinuation. In approximately half of the patients who experienced Grade 3 neutropenia, it was managed by dose modification, with only one case leading to entinostat discontinuation. Additional reasons leading to EE discontinuation included two patients owing to nausea and vomiting and one patient each owing to weakness in extremities, hypoxia/radiation pneumonitis, fatigue and mucositis. 
 The incidence of serious AEs was similar between the EE and EP groups at 16% and 12%, respectively, with four EE patients each experiencing a Grade 4 AE, including fatigue, leucopenia, neutropenia and hypercalcemia. One fatal AE occurred in each treatment arm with the EE event considered related to disease progression. We did not observe significant cardiovascular effects in this trial, which have been reported with other HDAC inhibitors. 
 Following positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, entinostat in combination with exemestane was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in advanced HR+ breast cancer and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer. 
 E2112: Ongoing Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
 To confirm the PFS and overall survival benefits observed in the Phase 2b clinical trial, we have collaborated with ECOG-ACRIN to develop and conduct the Phase 3 clinical trial. ECOG-ACRIN is conducting the trial under sponsorship and funding support from the NCI. We are providing financial and operational support for the Phase 3 clinical trial under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, with the NCI and a separate agreement with ECOG-ACRIN. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of entinostat in combination with exemestane compared to exemestane and a placebo. The protocol for the Phase 3 clinical trial was reviewed and agreed upon by the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreement with the NCI in January 2014. The trial initiated enrollment of 600 patients in the second quarter of 2014. Based on information received from ECOG-ACRIN to date, and our interpretation of enrollment trends, we expect that the trial will fully enroll patients in the third quarter of 2018. We cannot provide assurance that the E2112 clinical trial will be completed or that data will be received on the timeline indicated because we are not responsible for the conduct of this trial.
 The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to exemestane improves PFS, overall survival or both PFS and overall survival in patients with advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer who have previously progressed after treatment with standard of care hormonal agents such as NSAIs or Faslodex. The NCI and ECOG-ACRIN, in collaboration with us, have designed the trial to have two primary endpoints of PFS and overall survival. If data are positive, we expect that either endpoint may serve as the basis for submitting a new drug application, or NDA. The Phase 3 clinical trial also contains secondary patient-reported outcomes, or PRO, endpoints to evaluate differences between arms in treatment toxicities, reduced symptom burden as an indicator of treatment response, and overall health-related quality of life. PRO measures are common in ECOG-ACRIN therapeutic trials due to the scientific aims of its Cancer Control & Outcomes Program, which seeks to increase understanding, from the patient perspective, about how novel therapies impact quality of life. Secondary objectives of the trial include assessments of safety, response rate and biomarker analysis.

Details of the trial design are provided below: 
 
The enrollment size of 600 patients in the trial is adequate for achieving a statistically significant difference in median PFS with a p-value less than 0.002 and in median overall survival with a p-value less than 0.048 based on the trial supporting a hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.58 for PFS and 0.75 for overall survival. If the hypothesized hazard ratio for PFS is true, the PFS endpoint has an 88.5% chance of success. Similarly, if the hypothesized hazard ratio of overall survival is true, the overall survival endpoint has an 80% chance of success. 
 In November 2017, ECOG-ACRIN notified us that the Data Safety Monitoring Committee, or DSMC, completed the final PFS analysis and the first interim analysis for overall survival. The results of this analysis are held confidentially by the ECOG-ACRIN study statistician and the DSMC. The primary analysis of PFS was conducted after 247 PFS events occurred out of the initial 360 patients enrolled. Stopping rules based upon the interim analyses of overall survival have been outlined such that enrollment may terminate early if the statistical boundary for overall survival is met.
 In the absence of early stopping, the results of the primary analysis of PFS will be made available to us when all 600 patients have entered the trial, which is anticipated to be in the third quarter of 2018. If the PFS endpoint is met, interim overall survival results will be released to us at that time as well. If the primary analysis of PFS has failed to achieve statistical significance, and any of the interim analyses of OS do not demonstrate a statistically significant overall survival benefit, ECOG-ACRIN will not release the results of such interim analyses to us. 
 If the primary analysis of PFS has achieved statistical significance, and the overall survival data demonstrate a positive trend, we expect to use that data in a new drug application, or NDA, submission based on meeting the primary PFS endpoint and agreement with the FDA that the PFS data are statistically significant and clinically meaningful. 
 The primary analysis of overall survival data represents another opportunity for submission of an NDA to the FDA for potential approval. The primary analysis of overall survival will occur when 410 deaths from among the 600 patients enrolled have occurred. Based on information received from ECOG-ACRIN to date, we expect this primary analysis to occur no sooner than 2019. 
 If the primary analysis of PFS fails to achieve statistical significance, a positive OS outcome at any interim analysis during the conduct of the trial will also be a potential NDA submission and approval pathway. ECOG-ACRIN will perform up to seven interim analyses of overall survival, approximately every six months, to assess the potential superiority of the combination of entinostat and exemestane relative to the combination of exemestane and a placebo. The 410 deaths required for the primary analysis of overall survival takes into consideration any statistical impact of the various interim analyses on the analysis of the overall survival endpoint.

Immuno-Oncology 
 Background 
 Entinostat is currently being studied in clinical trials across a broad range of solid tumors, including breast, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, melanoma, ovarian and microsatellite stable colorectal carcinoma, or MSS-CRC. We are working in collaboration with Merck to study the combination of entinostat with Merck’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (ENCORE 601) of up to approximately 202 patients with NSCLC, melanoma or MSS-CRC. The Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of the combination of entinostat and Keytruda and has progressed to the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, which is assessing the safety and efficacy of entinostat combined with Keytruda in patients with either advanced metastatic or recurrent NSCLC, melanoma or MSS-CRC. 
 We have also entered into a collaboration with Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of entinostat in combination with Genentech’s immune checkpoint inhibitor, Tecentriq® (atezolizumab), in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (ENCORE 602) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC. In January 2018 we entered into a second clinical collaboration with Genentech to evaluate the combination of entinostat with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in patients with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer in a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial that will enroll patients with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer who have experienced disease progression during or following treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Genentech will be responsible for conducting the trial. 
 We have also entered into a collaboration with Ares Trading, S.A., a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Pfizer to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of entinostat in combination with Bavencio, Pfizer’s monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, ENCORE 603, of patients with ovarian cancer. Additionally, entinostat is being evaluated in over 10 ongoing and additional planned investigator-sponsored clinical trials that are designed to provide further validation of entinostat’s immuno-modulatory activity in various other immuno-responsive tumors. We believe that there may be further opportunities through these and additional collaborations to expand the indications in which entinostat may target immunologic mechanisms of resistance to cancer therapies. 
 Entinostat with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in NSCLC, Melanoma and MSS-CRC
 Market Overview and Current Treatment—NSCLC 
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women, with more people dying of lung cancer each year than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 80% to 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC; and in 2017, an estimated 222,500 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, and an estimated 155,870 people died from lung cancer in the United States. The five-year survival rate for patients with lung cancer generally is 18% and for patients with Stage IV is approximately 5%, indicating a significant need for new therapies that can prolong overall survival. 
 Advanced/metastatic NSCLC is a severe disease with a poor prognosis in the majority of patients. Treatment typically included a first-line combination chemotherapy followed by a choice of a second-line therapeutic approach. Most patients receiving first-line chemotherapy will progress within one year of treatment with a median PFS of approximately six to seven months and median overall survival of approximately 12 to 14 months. In the second-line setting, the median PFS for standard chemotherapy is approximately three to four months and median overall survival is approximately six to nine months. 
 However, the treatment paradigm of NSCLC has been changing since early 2015 when the FDA approved Opdivo, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody as the first immune-targeted drug to treat people with squamous NSCLC in patients who have relapsed after platinum-based chemotherapy. Since the approval of Opdivo (nivolumab), two additional check point inhibitors, Tecentriq a PD-L1 antibody from Roche/Genentech and Keytruda, a PD-1 antibody from Merck, have been approved as a treatment for both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients after use of platinum-based chemotherapy. A third agent, Imfinzi, a PD-L1 antibody from AstraZeneca, is currently under priority review by the FDA or the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC after platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and is expected to be approved in early 2018. The efficacy data observed 
 8


with these agents represents a significant increase from what has traditionally been expected of drugs approved to treat advanced NSCLC, and we believe that immune checkpoint inhibitors have made their way forward to become the standard of care for this patient population. Keytruda has also demonstrated an improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, with greater than 50% PD-L1 expression in their tumors that had not received prior systemic treatment for advanced NSCLC, as well as in combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression status. 
 There are other PD-L1 inhibitors being developed to treat NSCLC, such as Merck KGaA/Pfizer’s Bavencio, BeiGene, Ltd.’s BGB-A317, and Sanofi/Regeneron’s cemiplimab which are in Phase 3 trials. The clinical development programs for these PD-L1 inhibitors have been designed to understand the broad impact they could have across NSCLC, including chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients, as well as earlier stage patients. We anticipate the immune checkpoint inhibitors will be available for use across the spectrum of advanced NSCLC patients. 
 However, even as the development of these immune checkpoint inhibitors represent a significant advance for NSCLC patients, most patients may still see their disease progress and the proportion of treated patients with low PD-L1 expression who respond to approved regimens is quite low (~10%). We believe with these disease-progressing patients and low response rates, there is significant room to improve upon the benefit of PD-L1 inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms. 
 Market Overview and Current Treatment—Melanoma 
 The incidence of malignant melanoma in most developed countries has risen faster than any other cancer type since the mid-1950s. In 2011, the average survival duration for patients with Stage IV melanoma, in which the melanoma has metastasized, was only six to ten months; and the five-year survival rate for such patients was 16%. Although this rate had not changed in some time, a recent major advance for melanoma came with the development and approval of drugs such as Zelboraf® (vemurafenib), Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) and Mekinist® (trametinib), for patients with a mutated BRAF gene, which is a human gene that encodes a protein called B Raf. 
 Melanoma is a particularly immune-responsive tumor, and thus, immunotherapy of melanoma has developed as a dynamic field for clinical research. To date, immunotherapies such as Yervoy® (ipilmumab), Keytruda and Opdivo, have been approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma patients with unresectable or metastatic disease. However, in this tumor type as well, the immunotherapies represent a significant advance for only a small proportion of patients, leaving significant room to improve upon the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms. 
 Market Overview and Current Treatment—MSS-CRC
 Colorectal cancer is the 4th most common cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. Currently, the average survival duration for patients with Stage IV CRC, in which the cancer has metastasized, was only two to two and a half years; and the five-year survival rate for such patients was 14%. This rate has improved incrementally over time, with approval of drugs like Avastin, Erbitux, Stivarga and Lonsurf.
 Most CRC patients have microsatellite stable disease which, unlike microsatellite instable CRC, has been shown to be more resistant to checkpoint inhibition therapy. Recent pre-clinical evidence suggests that combining alternate mechanisms with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor could increase response rates and lead to lasting benefit for patients. Roche Genentech recently reported an 8% response rate with a combination of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq, and, Cotellic® (cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor. It has taken the combination into a phase III clinical trial and expects data in 2018. However, in this tumor type as well, there is still significant room to improve upon the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors through combinations with drugs, like entinostat, that target immune modulation through complementary mechanisms.

Our Development of Entinostat in NSCLC, Melanoma and MSS-CRC
 We have a clinical collaboration underway with Merck to study the safety and efficacy of entinostat in combination with Keytruda in patients with NSCLC, malignant melanoma and MSS-CRC. The ENCORE 601 clinical trial is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. The Phase 1b portion evaluated the safety, tolerability and biomarker correlates of the combination of entinostat and Keytruda in patients with NSCLC. The Phase 2 portion is assessing both the safety and efficacy of entinostat combined with Keytruda in patients with NSCLC, melanoma and MSS-CRC. The trial is an open label, dose escalation study with cohort expansions at the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, in NSCLC, melanoma and MSS-CRC patients. We are conducting the trial in the United States and have enrolled approximately 175 patients with 22 of those having been enrolled in the Phase 1b portion and approximately 153 of those to be enrolled in the Phase 2 portion. We announced safety data and recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, data from the Phase 1b portion in the first half of 2016 and in the second half of 2016, respectively. We initiated patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion in October 2016, and we expect final efficacy data in 2018. 
 The primary objective of the Phase 1b portion of the trial was to determine the dose-limiting toxicities, or DLT, maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, or the RP2D of entinostat given in combination with Keytruda. The initial three patients in Cohort 1 received weekly oral entinostat at a starting dose of 3 mg along with Keytruda 200 mg via intravenous infusion. Enrollment in Cohort 1 was increased to six patients after one of the initial three patients developed a serious immune-mediated adverse event. The patient in question developed Grade 3 elevations in alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin, which were considered to be manifestations of immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis is included in the Keytruda U.S. Prescribing Information as a potential adverse drug reaction. The adverse event was successfully managed by withholding study drugs and administering systemic corticosteroids, leading to a rapid normalization of the abnormal laboratory values and resolution of symptoms. Based on a thorough safety review of all six patients, which demonstrated no similar events or any other dose-limiting toxicities, the 3 mg dosing was deemed tolerable; and in December 2015, dosing was escalated to entinostat weekly oral doses of 5 mg, which enrolled seven patients. The prospective RP2D was confirmed in nine additional patients. The Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial also characterized the effect of the combination therapy on numerous biomarkers, including expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, the number and function of different types of T cells and the number of MDSCs. We are assessing these biomarkers both in peripheral blood and in serial tumor biopsies. 
 In the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, we are evaluating entinostat in combination with Keytruda using the RP2D identified in the Phase 1b portion with the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of the combination in three expansion cohorts. In each cohort we are using a two-stage design in which a defined minimum number of responders must be seen in the first stage for the cohort to advance to full enrollment in the second stage. We have recently completed enrollment of the three cohorts in the first stage of the Phase 2 portion in patients with NSCLC and melanoma and therefore have closed enrollment for these cohorts. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion of the trial was designed to evaluate the results from these first cohorts and make an informed decision around expanding and progressing any, all or none of the cohorts into the next stage of the trial only after attaining a certain pre-specified and meaningful level of objective response in each cohort. We have completed enrollment of the first stage of the Phase 2 portion for all four cohorts. In the first half of 2017, both the PD-L-1 pretreated melanoma and NSCLC cohort of ENCORE 601 met the pre-specified objective response threshold; and both progressed to the second stage of the trial.  Initially, the melanoma cohort enrolled an additional 21 patients and to increase statistical power and decrease type I error, we subsequently enrolled an additional 18 patients. Enrollment of the full 52 patients is nearing completion. We expect to share data on the first 34 patients in the second quarter of 2018. Similarly, the cohort enrolling PD-L-1 pretreated NSCLC initially enrolled an additional 25 patients in stage 2, but we subsequently enrolled an additional 14 patients to increase statistical power and decrease type I error.  Enrollment of the full 70 patients in this arm is complete and we expect data to be available in the second quarter of 2018.  In the second half of 2017, we announced that the cohort enrolling PD-L-1 naïve NSCLC patients also met the established criteria to advance to stage 2, however due to the changing landscape in this patient population, we have decided to not progress this cohort into the second stage of the Phase 2 portion. The first stage of the Phase 2 portion of the MSS-CRC cohort completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2017, and patients continue to be treated with the entinostat-Keytruda combination. We require at least two confirmed objective responses to proceed to the second stage, and anticipate having enough data to determine whether to progress to stage 2 in the first half of 2018.

Secondary objectives of the trial include assessments of safety, efficacy as measured by clinical benefit rate at six months, PFS at six months, overall PFS, overall survival, duration of response and time to response. Additional exploratory objectives include evaluation of changes in biomarkers in blood and tissue samples collected from patients that may reflect entinostat activity on immune cells.

Entinostat with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in TNBC 
 Market Overview and Current Treatment 
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States after lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2017 approximately 253,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and an estimated 41,000 people will die from breast cancer in the United States. Although the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer is over 85%, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer is only 24%, indicating the need for new therapies that can prolong overall survival. 
 Breast cancers can be divided into three subsets based on the presence or absence in the tumor of the following protein receptors: 
  
• | HR+, which means expressing the estrogen receptor, or ER, or progesterone receptor, or PR, alone or in combination with each other;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HER2+, which means expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2 receptor; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Triple negative, which means not expressing ER, PR or HER2.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 TNBC represents 15-20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases, and is associated with a younger age at diagnosis, advanced stage at diagnosis, increased risk of visceral metastasis and poorer outcome. The five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with Stage IV TNBC is only 22% with limited treatment options. Preliminary data has indicated that treatment with PD-L1 inhibitors results in approximately a 20% response rate in women with TNBC, and Tecentriq and Keytruda are currently being studied in Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Our Development Plan of Entinostat in TNBC 
 We established a clinical collaboration with Genentech to study the safety and efficacy of entinostat in combination with atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with TNBC. The ENCORE 602 clinical trial is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, and the Phase 1b portion is initially evaluating the safety of weekly oral entinostat at a dose of 5 mg administered in combination with 1,200 mg of Tecentriq given intravenously every three weeks. 
 11


Enrollment in the Phase 1b trial was completed in November 2016. The RP2D of entinostat was established as 5 mg weekly. The Phase 2 portion of the trial was opened in December 2016. The Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 clinical trial is PFS, with response rate, duration of response, time to response and overall survival as secondary end points. Additional exploratory objectives include evaluation of changes in biomarkers in blood and tissue samples collected from patients that may reflect entinostat activity on immune cells. We anticipate efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 portion in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 In January 2018 we entered into a second clinical collaboration with Genentech to evaluate the combination of entinostat with Tecentriq® (atezolizumab) in patients with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer. The planned Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial will enroll patients with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer who have experienced disease progression during or following treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Genentech will be responsible for conducting the trial. 
 Entinostat with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer 
 Market Overview and Current Treatment—Ovarian Cancer 
 The National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 22,000 women were diagnosed and just over 14,000 died from ovarian cancer in the United States in 2017. The past few decades have seen some improvement in median five-year survival for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer, but the trend has been modest, increasing from 36% in 1977 to 47% in 2017. 
 Currently, more than 60% of women are diagnosed with advanced disease and therapeutic options for these patients are still dominated by traditional chemotherapeutics, such as platinums, taxanes and anthracyclines. Since 2014, four targeted agents have been approved for second line or later treatment: Avastin® (bevacizumab), a vascular endothelial growth factor specific angiogenesis inhibitor, and three poly ADP-ribose polymerase, or PARP, inhibitors, Lynparza® (olaparib), RubracaTM (rucaparib), and Zejula® (niraparib). However, the progression free survival for PARPs is 9 months or less in unselected patients, with much longer durability seen in the ~10% of patients with germline BRCA mutations, highlighting the need to further improve upon patient care for most patients. The safety and the efficacy of immune-targeted therapy in ovarian cancer has not yet been demonstrated, but Tecentriq and Bavencio are in Phase 3 development. 
 Our Development Plan of Entinostat in Ovarian Cancer 
 We have a clinical trial collaboration with Merck KGaA and Pfizer to study the safety and efficacy of entinostat in combination with avelumab, an investigational anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with ovarian cancer. The ENCORE 603 clinical trial is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, where the Phase 1b portion will initially evaluate the safety of weekly, oral entinostat with Bavencio. The Phase 2 portion of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was opened in the third quarter of 2017.  The primary endpoint is PFS, with response rate, duration of response, time to response and overall survival as secondary end points. We continue to enroll patients into the Phase 2 portion of ENCORE 603 and anticipate enrollment completion in the first half of 2018, with efficacy and safety data available in the first half of 2019. Additional exploratory objectives include evaluation of changes in biomarkers in blood and tissue samples collected from patients that may reflect the effect of entinostat on immune cells.
Additional Development Activities of Entinostat 
 To complement our ongoing company-sponsored trials of entinostat, we are currently collaborating with the NCI and independent investigators to explore additional opportunities of entinostat across multiple tumor types.  Most of these clinical studies are Phase 1 or 2 trials assessing entinostat in combination with immuno-oncology agents in which we hope to further validate the preclinical observations that entinostat can enhance the clinical activity of these agents. The remaining studies are assessing the combination of entinostat with a variety of other oncology therapeutic agents where there is strong preclinical rationale for the combination and a strong unmet need.  The NCI or the investigators’ academic institutions are sponsors of the studies, thus Syndax is not responsible for the oversight or conduct of these clinical trials.  We cannot provide assurance that they will be completed or that data will be received on the timeline indicated, but we are hopeful that data from selected studies will become available starting in 2018.

SNDX-6352 
 We are also developing SNDX-6352, which we believe may enhance the body’s immune response on tumors that have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy. With our entinostat program we have identified that many tumors have the ability to evade both the innate and adaptive immune system through direct cellular interactions and recruitment of immuno-suppressive cells such as MDSCs and Tregs to the area surrounding the tumor. Research has identified a third type of immuno-suppressive cell, known as a TAM, that is also recruited to the area surrounding the tumor and, together with MDSCs and Tregs, plays a significant role in helping a tumor evade detection and elimination by the immune system. TAMs are believed to play at least two key roles in promoting tumor cell growth. The first is to block the activity of those T cells that mediate the ability of the immune response to kill the tumor cell. The second is to secrete certain growth factors that induce the tumor cells to divide. Similar to MDSCs and Tregs, high levels of TAMs have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis for certain cancers and preclinical studies have demonstrated that inhibition of TAMs can enhance anti-tumor immune responses. 
 Investigation into how TAMs are formed and recruited to the area surrounding the tumor has discovered that TAMs express on their cell surface a receptor known as CSF-1R that controls their growth. CSF-1R activity is regulated by two molecules, CSF-1 and IL-34, that have been shown by researchers to bind directly to CSF-1R. Studies show that blocking both CSF-1 and IL-34 may be required to fully block signaling through CSF-1R and reduce the number and function of TAMs. SNDX-6352 is an IgG4 isotype that binds to the ligand binding domain of CSF-1R, blocking the binding and consequent activation by both IL-34 and CSF-1 and disrupting TAM activity. 
 We and our collaborators are developing SNDX-6352 to bind to CSF-1R and block the ability of CSF-1 and IL-34 to bind to and activate CSF-1R signaling. UCB Biopharma Sprl, or UCB, has demonstrated in preclinical studies that were designed to measure the amount of SNDX-6352 bound to the CSF-1R, that SNDX-6352 binds to human CSF-1R with high affinity as indicated by a dissociation constant value, or KD, of 4-8 picomolar (pM). These studies also showed that SNDX-6352 can bind to human and cynomolgus monkey CSF-1R but not rodent CSF-1R. 
 One way in which investigators show that CSF-1 and IL-34 bind to and activate CSF-1R is to measure the amount of a secreted factor known as monocyte chemotactic protein 1, or MCP-1, that is released by cells when CSF-1R signaling is activated. A lower amount of MCP-1 can mean that the binding of CSF-1 and IL-34 have been blocked. Preliminary research shows that SNDX-6352 potently inhibits both CSF-1 and IL-34 induced MCP-1 release from human monocytes (IC50, 270pM and 100pM, respectively). 
 A second way in which investigators measure the activity of CSF-1R blockade is to count the number of circulating cells known as non-classical monocytes. The cells can be identified by expression of cell surface markers called CD14 and CD16. Researchers have shown that blocking CSF-1R signaling results in a decrease in the number of non-classical monocytes, and SNDX-6352 has been shown to reduce the number of non-classical monocytes in a preclinical trial. 
 A third way to demonstrate that SNDX-6352 can bind to CSF-1R and block binding of CSF-1 is to measure the level of circulating CSF-1 in the blood. Researchers have shown that blocking CSF-1R results in increased levels of CSF-1. The amount of circulating CSF-1 can therefore be used as measurement of the amount of SNDX-6352 bound to CSF-1R. To understand the expected clinical activity of SNDX-6352 in human subjects, we and our collaborators have conducted studies with SNDX-6352 across a range of doses in cynomolgus monkeys. Our preclinical data indicate that SNDX-6352 causes sustained increases in CSF-1 levels for at least 14 days at doses greater than 5 mg per kilogram of bodyweight. 
 We believe that the results of UCB’s preclinical studies combined demonstrate that SNDX-6352 is a potent CSF-1R binding antibody that can block the activation of CSF-1R signaling through both IL-34 and CSF-1 and reduce the number of CSF-1R expressing target cells. 
 Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish proof of concept that SNDX-6352 can provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients in one or more tumor types when combined with standard of care therapies for a given indication. We intend to conduct clinical trials in patients with tumor types having clear unmet needs (e.g., NSCLC, TNBC, prostate, melanoma, pancreatic, ovarian, bladder) and where we believe that the inhibition of TAMs via CSF-1R inhibition will synergize with the current standard of care, inducing tumor regressions. 
 13


To determine the safety profile of SNDX-6352 in patients with solid tumors, we commenced SNDX-6352-502, a multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2017. In addition to assessing safety assessment at increasing doses of SNDX-6352, we will collect information on the concentration of SNDX-6352 and levels of CSF-1, IL-34 and non-classical monocytes in the blood. We are conducting the trial at multiple centers in the United States and at this time we anticipate enrolling 48 patients in the study. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 1 trial by the end of third quarter of 2018.  We expect to utilize the safety assessment of SNDX-6352 to determine the starting dose for subsequent clinical trials testing multiple doses of SNDX-6352 as a single agent and in combinations. 
 Preclinical Program
 The Menin Assets
 We are developing a series of potent and selective inhibitors, which we refer to as the Menin Assets, targeting the binding interaction of Menin with MLLr. Rearrangements involving the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia, KMT2A) gene (MLLr) occur broadly in acute leukemia and are associated with poor patient outcomes. Menin is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein and the MLLr-menin interaction is the key impetus for transformation of MLLr-expressing cells. Inhibition of the Menin and MLL1 interaction has been shown to reverse leukemic gene expression driven by MLL-fusion proteins and is a potential targeted therapeutic strategy in MLL-rearranged AML. We expect to select a lead investigational therapeutic from the portfolio of Menin Assets and file an IND in 2019.
Collaborations 
 Clinical Collaborations in Immuno-Oncology 
 Merck—MSD International GmbH 
 In March 2015, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck, under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Merck’s drug Keytruda in patients with NSCLC and melanoma. We are the sponsor of the clinical trial. Merck will supply Keytruda for use in the clinical trial. Neither party will have any obligation to reimburse any costs incurred by the other party, except that a party may be required to reimburse the manufacturing costs of the other party upon certain early termination events. 
 To the extent any inventions arise from the clinical trial, each party will solely own inventions relating to its drug alone, and the parties will jointly own any inventions relating to the combination of the two drugs. In most cases, clinical data from the trial will be jointly owned. However, each party will separately analyze clinical samples obtained from trial participants, and each party will solely own the sample analysis data that it generates. 
 Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement if it believes that there is imminent danger to patients in the clinical trial, or if a regulatory authority takes an action that prevent such party from supplying its drug, or if such party decides to discontinue development of its drug. Merck may terminate the agreement if we fail to make any changes to the clinical trial protocol that are reasonably requested by Merck to address a perceived safety issue or if we undergo a change of control with a company that is clinically developing or marketing a drug having the same mechanism of action as Keytruda. 
 Genentech 
 In August 2015, we entered into a combination study collaboration agreement with Genentech under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Genentech’s drug atezolizumab in patients with TNBC. We will be the sponsor of the clinical trial. Genentech will supply atezolizumab for use in the clinical trial. Each party will perform its obligations under the agreement at its own expense, including its internal costs. 
 14


In January 2018, we entered into a combination study collaboration agreement with Genentech under which Genentech will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with Genentech’s drug atezolizumab in patients with HR+, HER2-, metastatic breast cancer. Genentech will be the sponsor of the clinical trial. We will supply entinostat for use in the clinical trial. Each party will perform its obligations under the agreement at its own expense, including its internal costs.
 To the extent any inventions arise from any of the clinical trials, each party will solely own inventions relating to its drug alone, and the parties will jointly own any inventions relating to the combination of the two drugs. In most cases, data from a trial will be jointly owned. However, each party will solely own certain sample analysis data generated from clinical samples obtained from trial participants. 
 Either party may terminate either agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, either party may terminate either agreement if it determines that the trial may unreasonably affect patient safety, or if a regulatory authority withdraws the approval to conduct a trial or takes an action that prevent such party from supplying its drug, or if the other party or its employees are sanctioned under certain healthcare-related laws, or if such party decides to discontinue development of its drug.
 Merck KGaA and Pfizer 
 In December 2015, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck KGaA and Pfizer under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating entinostat in combination with an investigational monoclonal antibody, avelumab, in patients with ovarian cancer. Avelumab is being developed collaboratively by Merck KGaA and Pfizer, which are together treated as a single party for purposes of this agreement. We will be the sponsor of the clinical trial. Merck KGaA and Pfizer will supply avelumab for use in the clinical trial. During the term of the trial or the term of the agreement, whichever is shorter, each party has agreed not to initiate any clinical trial in combination with such party’s drug and a third party drug for the treatment of ovarian cancer if the third party drug has the same target and mechanism of action as the other party’s drug, subject to certain exceptions. 
 To the extent any inventions arise from the clinical trial, each party will solely own inventions relating to its drug alone, and the parties will jointly own any inventions relating to the combination of the two drugs. In most cases, data from the trial will be jointly owned. However, each party will solely own certain sample analysis data generated from clinical samples obtained from trial participants. 
 Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement if it determines that the trial may unreasonably affect patient safety, or if a regulatory authority takes an action that prevent such party from supplying its drug, or if such party decides to discontinue development of its drug. Merck KGaA and Pfizer may also terminate the agreement if we fail to make any changes to the clinical trial protocol that are reasonably requested by them to address a perceived safety issue. 
 NCI and Investigator Collaborations 
 Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Entinostat 
 Our collaboration with the NCI is governed by a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA, between us and the NCI. The CRADA was originally signed by Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Mitsui, and was then assigned to Schering AG following Schering AG’s acquisition of Mitsui. In 2007, Schering AG (then known as Bayer Schering Pharma AG) agreed to assign the CRADA to us in connection with the execution of a license, development and commercialization agreement, or the Bayer license agreement, with Bayer. 
 Under the CRADA, as amended, the NCI sponsors clinical studies on entinostat using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions, including ECOG-ACRIN and JHU. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these clinical studies, and we are obligated to supply the clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other clinical trial. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA. 
 15


We own any intellectual property generated in the course of the collaboration with the NCI, or Collaboration IP, to the extent that Collaboration IP is generated by our employees. We also have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license under Collaboration IP generated by the NCI. With respect to any Collaboration IP that is owned by or licensed to us, we have agreed to grant the United States government a non-exclusive license to practice or have practiced this Collaboration IP throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes. 
 Either party may terminate the CRADA either by mutual consent or unilaterally upon advance written notice to the other party. Absent such early termination, the CRADA will expire on May 21, 2018. As we have in the past, we expect to renew the CRADA at that time. 
 Clinical Trial Agreement with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
 In March 2014, we entered into a clinical trial agreement with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, a contracting entity for ECOG-ACRIN, which describes the parties’ obligations with respect to the NCI-sponsored pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of entinostat. Under the terms of the clinical trial agreement, ECOG-ACRIN will perform this clinical trial in accordance with the clinical trial protocol and a mutually agreed scope of work. In January 2015, we amended the agreement to provide for additional patient site reimbursement funds, which will be paid based on milestone-based payments. We will provide a fixed level of financial support for the clinical trial through an upfront payment of $695,000 and a series of time- and milestone-based payments of up to $970,000, and we are obligated to supply entinostat and placebo to ECOG-ACRIN for use in the clinical trial. During the second quarter of 2016, the agreement was amended to provide additional study activities and the contractual obligation increased by $0.8 million. We have agreed to provide this additional financial support to fund the additional activities required to ensure that the E2112 clinical trial will satisfy FDA registration requirements. As of December 31, 2017, our aggregate payment obligations under this agreement are approximately $24.3 million; and our remaining obligations under this agreement were $13.0 million over an estimated period of approximately four years. During the first quarter of 2017, the agreement was amended to expand the study to include enrollments from Korean sites, and the contractual obligation increased by $0.5 million. 
 Data and inventions from the Phase 3 clinical trial are owned by ECOG-ACRIN. We have access to the data generated in the clinical trial, both directly from ECOG-ACRIN under the clinical trial agreement, as well as from the NCI through our agreement with it. Additionally, ECOG-ACRIN has granted us a non-exclusive license to any inventions or discoveries that are derived from entinostat as a result of its use during the clinical trial, along with a first right to negotiate an exclusive license to any of these inventions or discoveries. 
 Either party may terminate the clinical trial agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or if the FDA or NCI withdraws the authorization to perform the clinical trial in the United States. The parties may jointly terminate the clinical trial agreement if the parties agree that safety-related issues support termination. 
 Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Entinostat and SNDX-6352 
 In September 2016, we entered into a collaboration with the NCI related to both entinostat and SNDX-6352 is governed by a CRADA between us and the NCI. Under the CRADA, the NCI sponsors clinical studies on entinostat and SNDX-6352 using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these clinical studies, and we are obligated to supply the clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat and SNDX-6352. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other clinical trial. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA. 
 We own all intellectual property generated during the collaboration with the NCI, or 6352 Collaboration IP, to the extent that 6352 Collaboration IP is generated by our employees. We also have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license under 6352 Collaboration IP generated by the NCI. With respect to any 6352 Collaboration IP that is owned by or licensed to us, we have agreed to grant the United States government a non-exclusive license to practice or have practiced this 6352 Collaboration IP throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes. 
 16


Investigator Collaborations 
 We have collaborated with a limited number of third parties on the clinical development of entinostat and SNDX-6352. For example, we have supplied entinostat for use in investigator-sponsored clinical trials conducted at JHU and we plan to enter into similar arrangements with other hospitals and medical centers in the future. Investigator-sponsored clinical trials are generally performed under an IND application filed by the investigator or his or her institution. To date, our sole obligation with respect to these investigator-sponsored clinical trials has been to supply entinostat for use in the trials. 
License Agreement 
 Kyowa Hakko Kirin 
 In December 2014, we entered into a license, development and commercialization agreement with Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK, under which KHK received an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize entinostat in Japan and Korea. This license includes a sublicense under the rights we received under the Bayer license agreement. If we acquire or develop any other anti-cancer drug that, like entinostat, is a selective inhibitor of Class I HDAC, such drug will be included in this license as well. We will manufacture and supply entinostat to KHK during the term of the agreement, and such obligation may continue for a longer period if KHK continues to sell entinostat following expiration of the agreement or termination of the agreement for our breach. During the term of the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each party is prohibited from commercializing in the Japan and Korea any other selective inhibitor of Class I HDACs for the same indication as entinostat, with all forms of cancer being treated as the same indication. 
 We received an upfront license fee of $17.5 million, and KHK purchased 536,049 shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock for an aggregate price of approximately $7.5 million. We are eligible to receive up to $50.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $25.0 million in sales milestone payments. In October 2017, we announced that KHK dosed the first patient in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal Phase 2 trial of entinostat (designated KHK2375 by KHK), in combination with exemestane versus exemestane plus placebo in Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Enrollment of the first patient in this trial triggered a $5 million milestone payment to us from KHK.
 KHK will pay us a transfer price for the supply of entinostat as well as royalties on net sales of entinostat above a specified threshold each calendar year by KHK, its affiliates and sublicensees in the low single digits. Royalty payment obligations will be payable in each country in the KHK territory until the later to occur of (i) the date that all valid claims of the last effective license patent in such country expires or is abandoned, withheld or otherwise invalidated and (ii) 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of entinostat in such country. Any payments owed to Bayer as a result of KHK’s development and commercialization of entinostat in the KHK territory will be made by us out of the payments we receive from KHK. 
 The agreement with KHK will expire with respect to each country in the KHK territory upon the expiration of all royalty payment obligations in such country. In addition, we may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice to KHK if KHK or any affiliate commences any action or proceeding that challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent in the KHK territory. KHK may terminate the agreement in its entirety for convenience at any time upon advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, or bankruptcy or related actions or proceedings. If we commit an uncured material breach of certain provisions of the agreement, KHK may, instead of terminating the agreement, elect to continue the agreement in full force and effect except certain payments to us will be reduced.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to create a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates in the United States. Our targeted sales force will focus on a well-defined group of medical oncologists, primarily in the non-hospital and academic settings, who are responsible for the care and treatment of cancer patients. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we would also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to rely on our current partners and may seek additional pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities. 
 17


Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of entinostat or SNDX-6352, and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. We also do not have any current contractual relationship for the manufacture of commercial supplies. If entinostat or SNDX-6352 is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of such product. Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. 
Competition
 The pharmacologic treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MSS-CRC, ovarian cancer and TNBC patients includes chemotherapies and therapies targeting specific gene mutations. More recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for NSCLC and melanoma and are under investigation for ovarian cancer and TNBC. Since 2014, five PD-L-1 inhibitors have received FDA approvals for multiple indications including, Melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, urothelial, gastric, and merkel cell carcinoma. There continues to be active clinical investigation across multiple indications with numerous drugs being developed alone or in combination with the immunotherapeutic agents. We believe that if entinostat in combination with Keytruda, Tecentriq or Bavencio were approved for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MSS-CRC, TNBC or ovarian cancer, it would face competition from these standard-of-care approaches and other investigational drugs being tested in combination with any of these approaches. 
 If entinostat in combination with exemestane were approved for treatment of advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer, it could face competition from other therapies recently approved for use in combination with hormone therapy in this population, including Ibrance developed by Pfizer, Afinitor and Kisqali developed by Novartis, Verzenio developed by Eli Lilly and Company and other therapies currently in Phase 3 clinical development such as taselisib being developed by Roche Genentech or alpelisib being developed by Novartis. 
 Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 
 We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Intellectual Property
 Patents and Property Rights 
 Through licensed intellectual property and our owned intellectual property, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad claiming our proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us or our licensors in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted to us or to our licensors in the future will protect our technology. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights. 
 Entinostat Patent Portfolio 
 We strive to protect entinostat with multiple layers of patents. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio included one owned U.S. provisional patent applications jointly owned with The Regents of the University of Colorado, four owned pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, two granted non-U.S. patents (including one Canadian patent jointly owned with The Regents of the University of Colorado) and 46 non-U.S. pending patent applications (including two pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT). Also, we have filed national phase applications in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office, Ukraine and Georgia based on our owned PCT application directed to treatment of selected breast cancer patients with a combination of entinostat and exemestane. We have assigned our rights to the application we filed in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office to Domain Russia Investments Limited, or DRI. We have also assigned our rights to the applications we filed in Ukraine and Georgia to NovaMedica LLC, or NovaMedica. We have also filed national phase applications based on our owned PCT application directed to treatment of selected breast cancer patients with the combination of entinostat and exemestane in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the European Patent Office, or EPO, China, India, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Brazil and Mexico. Our owned entinostat patent portfolio includes pending U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat according to selected dosing regimens, methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an HER2 inhibitor, methods of treating lung cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an EGFR inhibitor, and treatments with entinostat combined with anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibodies. Our owned pending U.S. provisional and PCT applications relate to entinostat and CSF-1 or CSF-1R combination therapies and patient selection for combination therapy comprising entinostat and a second therapeutic agent, respectively. If issued, patents based on our owned pending U.S. applications and non-U.S. filings based on our owned PCT applications would expire between April 2029 and May 2038. 
 The patent portfolio we licensed from Bayer contains a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as patent applications pending outside the United States. A number of the patents and patent applications we licensed from Bayer are directed to entinostat while other patents and patent applications are directed to compounds other than entinostat. As of December 31, 2017, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer included seven issued U.S. patents, 62 granted non-U.S. patents and 17 patent applications pending in non-U.S. patent offices. For example, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer includes reissue U.S. Patent RE39,754, which covers a genus of benzamide compounds including entinostat or SNDX-275. RE39,754 is a composition of matter patent having an initial term which expired in September 2017. 
 The portfolio we licensed from Bayer also includes U.S. Patent 7,973,166, or the ’166 patent, which covers a crystalline polymorph of entinostat which is referred to as crystalline polymorph B, the crystalline polymorph used in the clinical development of entinostat. Many compounds can exist in different crystalline forms. A compound which in the solid state may exhibit multiple different crystalline forms is called polymorphic, and each crystalline 
 19


form of the same chemical compound is termed a polymorph. A new crystalline form of a compound may arise, for example, due to a change in the chemical process or the introduction of an impurity. Such new crystalline forms may be patented. By comparison, the U.S. Patent RE39,754, which expired in September 2017, covers the chemical entity of entinostat and any crystalline or non-crystalline form of entinostat. On March 7, 2014, our licensor Bayer applied for reissue of the ‘166 patent. The reissue application sought to add three additional inventors to the ‘166 patent. The reissue was granted as RE45,499 on April 28, 2015, at which time the original ‘166 patent was surrendered. The reissue patent has the same force and effect as the original ‘166 patent and the same August 2029 expiration date. 
 Of the 62 foreign-granted patents we licensed from Bayer, 26 are foreign counterparts of the ‘166 patent (now RE45,499) that cover crystalline polymorph B, the granted European patent comprises 37 national countries that all been validated, and the granted Eurasian patent comprises nine countries that have all been validated. Likewise, 15 of the 17 pending foreign applications are counterparts of the ‘166 crystalline polymorph B patent. Other patents and patent applications in the licensed Bayer portfolio cover methods of treatment by administration of entinostat. For example, U.S. Patent 7,317,028, which expired in October 2017, covers methods of treating selected cancers by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 7,687,525, which also expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating autoimmune disease by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 6,320,078, which expires in July 2019, covers methods of manufacturing entinostat; U.S. Patent No. 8,026,239, which expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating certain malignant tumors by administration of a compound within a subgenus of benzamide compounds including entinostat; U.S. Patent RE40,703, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat; and U.S. Patent 6,794,392, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat. 
 SNDX-6352 Patent Portfolio 
 We have also in-licensed from UCB a patent portfolio directed to SNDX-6352, an IND-ready anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. As of December 31, 2017, the SNDX-6352 composition-of-matter patent portfolio included one allowed U.S. non-provisional patent application, three granted non-U.S. patent and 36 non-U.S. pending patent applications. If issued, patents based on the in-licensed pending U.S. application and non-U.S. applications covering SNDX-6352 would expire in August 2034. Our in-licensed patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications directed to methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of fibrotic disease by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, and liquid pharmaceutical compositions of anti-CSF-1R antibodies. If issued, patents based on these pending applications would expire between November 2024 and February 2036. Further, the in-licensed portfolio includes three non-U.S. patents directed to methods of treating solid tumors by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity. The three patents will expire in October 2024. 
Menin Asset Patent Portfolio
 We have in-licensed from Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan, a patent portfolio directed to a series of selective preclinical inhibitors targeting the binding interaction of Menin with MLL-r.  As of December 31, 2017, the in-licensed portfolio included five non-U.S. pending patent applications (including three pending PCT applications) covering composition of matter and methods of treating, e.g., MLL. If issued, patents based on the in-licensed applications would expire between December 2036 and September 2037.
 Patent term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the earliest non-provisional application or PCT application. 
 In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and regulatory review process. To obtain a patent extension in the United States, the term of the 
 20


relevant patent must not have expired before the extension application, the patent cannot have been extended previously under this law, an application for extension must be submitted, the product must be subject to regulatory review prior to its commercialization, and the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. If our future products contain active ingredients which have not been previously approved, we may be eligible for a patent term extension in the United States. In the United States, we expect to seek extension of patent terms under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for patent claims covering a new chemical entity. If patent extensions are available to us outside of the United States, we would expect to file for a patent term extension in applicable jurisdictions.
 In-Licensed Intellectual Property 
 License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Bayer 
 In March 2007, we entered into the Bayer license agreement pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize entinostat and any other products containing the same active ingredient. The Bayer license agreement, as amended, permits us to use entinostat or other licensed products for the treatment of any human disease, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products for all commercially reasonable indications. Initially, Bayer manufactured and supplied our requirements of entinostat, but effective May 2012, manufacturing rights and responsibility for entinostat was transferred to us, by mutual agreement of the parties. 
 In connection with the execution of the Bayer license agreement, we were obligated to pay Bayer an upfront license fee of $2.0 million. We are also obligated to pay up to approximately $50.0 million in the aggregate upon obtaining certain milestones in the development and marketing approval of entinostat, assuming that we pursue at least two different indications for entinostat or any other licensed product. In June 2014, we achieved a research and development milestone, and in accordance with the terms of the Bayer license agreement, we paid $2.0 million to Bayer. 
 We are also obligated to pay Bayer $100.0 million in aggregate sales milestones, and a tiered single-digit royalty on net sales by us, our affiliates and sublicensees of entinostat and any other licensed products under the Bayer license agreement. We are obligated to pay Bayer these royalties on a country-by-country basis for the life of the relevant licensed patents covering such product or 15 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, whichever is longer. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Bayer would expire because no commercial sales of entinostat have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering entinostat in a given country may change in the future. 
 The Bayer license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations under the agreement in all countries. Upon expiration of the agreement our licenses become fully paid-up and irrevocable. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement if voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings are instituted against the other party, if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon the occurrence of other specific events relating to the insolvency or dissolution of the other party. Bayer may terminate the Bayer license agreement if we seek to revoke or challenge the validity of any patent licensed to us by Bayer under the Bayer license agreement or if we procure or assist a third party to take any such action. 
 License Agreement with UCB 
 In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with UCB, or the UCB license agreement, under which UCB granted us a worldwide, sublicenseable, exclusive license to UCB6352, which the Company refers to as SNDX-6352, an IND-ready anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody. The UCB license agreement permits us to use SNDX-6352 or other licensed products for all human uses, including treatment, prevention and diagnostic uses, in all indications, diseases, conditions or disorders, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize a certain licensed product. 
 21


In consideration for the license grant, we made a nonrefundable upfront payment of $5.0 million to UCB in the third quarter of 2016. Additionally, subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay UCB up to $119.5 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the UCB license agreement. In the event that we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees commercializes SNDX-6352, we will also be obligated to pay UCB low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $250.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with UCB. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of SNDX-6352, except that UCB is performing a limited set of transitional chemistry, manufacturing and control tasks related to SNDX-6352. 
 Each party may terminate the UCB license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the UCB license agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to UCB. UCB may terminate the UCB license agreement if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the UCB license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 License Agreement with Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 In October 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan, or the Allergan License Agreement, under which Allergan granted us an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to, the Menin Assets. We made a nonrefundable upfront payment of $5.0 million to Allergan in the fourth quarter of 2017. Additionally, subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay Allergan up to an aggregate of $99 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the Allergan License Agreement. In the event that we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees commercializes the Menin Assets, we will also be obligated to pay Allergan low single to low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $70.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with Allergan. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the Menin Assets.
 Each party may terminate the Allergan License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the Allergan License Agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to Allergan. Allergan may terminate the Allergan License Agreement if we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Allergan License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. 
 In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting and service agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us.

Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon, among other things, the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion, and postmarket surveillance of drugs. 
 The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of any product candidates, product or manufacturing changes, additional disease indications, or label changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action. 
 Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement actions. These actions could include the suspension or termination of clinical trials by the FDA, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, import detention, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any such administrative or judicial action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Although this discussion focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for and marketing of our product candidates in other countries. Generally, our product candidates will be subject to regulation in other countries that is similar in nature and scope as those imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. In Europe, for example, some significant aspects of regulation are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. 
 Drug Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologics such as SNDX-6352;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the application for filing and review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 23


 
• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of an NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Testing 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, toxicity profile and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 IND Application 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. A sponsor must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the submitted data or the conduct of the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1—The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk ratio of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues. 
 The FDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in an NDA or BLA. An SPA agreement is not a guarantee of product approval by the FDA or approval of any permissible claims about the product. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement. In particular, the SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns later come to light, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the IND sponsor fails to comply with the protocol agreed upon, or the relevant data, 
 24


assumptions, or information provided by the IND sponsor when requesting an SPA agreement change, are found to be false statements or misstatements, or are found to omit relevant facts. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include developed methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the finished drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 FDA Review and Approval Processes 
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. 
 The FDA will initially review an NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. After an NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 25


Upon the filing of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at 6 months, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review is given for drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. Whether priority or standard review applies, an additional 60 days is added to the target date for FDA action for new molecular entities. 
 After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that an NDA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in an NDA or BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study requirements. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of an NDA must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve an NDA without an approved REMS, if required. Depending on the FDA’s evaluation of a drug’s risks, a REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution requirements, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Following approval of an NDA with a REMS, the sponsor is responsible for marketing the drug in compliance with the REMS and must submit periodic REMS assessments to the FDA. 
 Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action. 
 Expedited Review Programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. For a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of an NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of an application. 
 26


Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 The FDA may also expedite the review of a drug designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. The designation of a drug as a breakthrough therapy provides the same benefits as are available under the Fast Track program, as well as intensive FDA guidance on the product’s development program. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a Breakthrough Therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or review process. 
 Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the “Hatch-Waxman Act,” Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of approved pioneer (brand name) NDA products. In considering whether to approve such a generic drug product submitted under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, the FDA generally requires that an ANDA applicant demonstrate that the proposed generic drug product’s active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration are the same as that of the reference product, that the two drugs are bioequivalent, that any impurities in the proposed product do not affect the product’s safety or effectiveness, and that its manufacturing processes and methods ensure the consistent potency and purity of its proposed product. Similarly, section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a reduced burden of demonstrating safety and effectiveness for an NDA for a product that is similar, but not identical, to the pioneer product. 
 The Hatch Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to provide certain information about patents related to the drug for listing in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, referred to as the Orange Book. ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants who seek to reference a pioneer drug must then certify regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the marketing of the applicant’s product is called a “Paragraph IV certification.” 
 27


The Hatch Waxman Act also provides periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain pioneer products during which FDA review or approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is precluded. If the pioneer product is a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, the FDA is precluded for a period of five years from accepting for review an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the same chemical entity. Under NCE exclusivity, the FDA may accept an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for review after four years, however, if that application contains a Paragraph IV certification challenging one of the pioneer’s listed patents. 
 The Hatch Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s approval of new uses of approved products, such as new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or conditions of use. During this three-year exclusivity period, the FDA may review but not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a product with the same conditions of use as supported by those new clinical investigations. This exclusivity will not necessarily prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for other products containing the same active ingredient. 
 If an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is accepted for filing by the FDA, the applicant must within 20 days provide notice to an NDA holder and patent owner that the application has been submitted and provide the factual and legal basis for the applicant’s opinion that the patent is invalid or not infringed. An NDA holder or patent owner may then file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If a suit is filed within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, the FDA is precluded from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a period of 30 months. The 30-month stay generally begins on the date of the receipt of notice by an NDA holder or patent owner. If the pioneer product has NCE exclusivity and the pioneer files suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application during the fifth year of exclusivity, however, the 30-month stay will not be triggered until five years from the date of the reference drug’s approval. The FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay if a court finds the patent invalid or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 If and when approved, any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences and submitting annual reports. 
 Good Manufacturing Practices 
 Drug manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. The FDA and certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any application, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of an application, or we may recall the product from distribution. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures and injunctive action. 
Advertising and Promotion 
 The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in 
 28


advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such products, and patients may decline to purchase them. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies. Such pressure, along with the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union, will likely put additional downward pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions, governmental laws and regulations related to government healthcare programs, healthcare reform, and pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies. 
 The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement to the extent products for which we may receive regulatory approval are covered under a pharmacy benefit or are otherwise subject to a formulary. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, 
 29


lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce, among other things, prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. 
 The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, including, without limitation, laws analogous to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some of these state laws apply to a broader range of conduct and may not have the same exceptions as analogous federal laws. Accordingly, our business will be subject to these provisions as well in the states in which we do business. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws we may be subject to penalties, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and data security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of certain individually identifiable health information. HIPAA applies to 
 30


certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates, which are entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service to or performing an activity for or on behalf of a covered entity. Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and/or criminal penalties and state attorneys’ general have authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Even if we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. We may also be subject to federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of other personal information, including federal and state consumer protection laws, state data security laws, and data breach notification laws. A data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge, investigation or legal action under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates receive approval and are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, international data protection laws (including the EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data as well as EU member state implementing legislation), and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our business, including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize, and the prices we may obtain for, any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following: 

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their sales of branded prescription drugs under certain government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay as a condition to having covered drugs available for payment under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and the addition of new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31


 
• | extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, under which a participating manufacturer must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing on January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program, known as the 340B drug pricing program;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the new requirements under the federal Open Payments program created as part of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must also report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges to continue. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the Affordable Care Act, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal or repeal and replace other elements of the Affordable Care Act.   
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, on average, through 2027, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 32


Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products once commercialized. 
 Regulations Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. For example, based on scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, we believe our current clinical development plan is likely to be insufficient to receive regulatory approval in Europe. During the next year, we plan to work with the EMA to formulate a development plan that may be more acceptable, but may be unsuccessful in doing so or such plan may not be feasible. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
Employees 
 As of March 7, 2018, we had 44 full-time employees and one part-time employee. Of the full-time employees, 28 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and ten have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 33


Research and Development 
 We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our product candidates. We incurred research and development expenses of $48.2 million, $31.7 million and $9.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development in 2018, as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development. 
Corporate and Other Information 
 We were incorporated in Delaware in 2005. In 2011, we established a wholly owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom and in 2014 we established a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary. There have been no material activities for these entities to date. We currently operate in one segment.
