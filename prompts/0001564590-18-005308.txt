Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company with an innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform that we are using to rationally design, develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of first-in-class or best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutic candidates for genetically defined diseases. Nucleic acid therapeutics are a growing and innovative class of drugs that have the potential to address diseases that have historically been difficult to treat with small molecule drugs or biologics. Nucleic acid therapeutics, or oligonucleotides, are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. We are initially developing oligonucleotides that target genetic defects to either reduce the expression of disease-promoting proteins or transform the production of dysfunctional mutant proteins into the production of functional proteins. 
 The nucleic acid therapeutics we are developing are stereopure. A stereopure oligonucleotide is comprised of molecules with atoms precisely arranged in three-dimensional orientations at each linkage. We believe that controlling the position of the sulfur atom following phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification, as described below, will optimize the pharmacological profile of our therapeutics by maximizing therapeutic effect while minimizing the potential for side effects and safety risks. The stereopure therapies we are developing differ from the mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market or in development by others. In nucleic acid therapeutics, the modification of the backbone of oligonucleotides with a PS linkage is a common alteration, where one non-bridging oxygen is replaced with a sulfur atom at each phosphate. In PS-modified oligonucleotides, each linkage creates a chiral center that has three-dimensional properties that can either have an “Sp” orientation or an “Rp” orientation. A chiral center is an atom that is bonded to a defined set of pendant groups arranged in a three-dimensional space in a way that is not superimposable on its mirror image. In traditionally synthesized PS-modified oligonucleotides, chiral configurations are not purposefully designed or controlled, creating mixtures of many thousands of molecules, each having distinct three-dimensional atomic arrangements. Such variations may convey differing pharmacological properties, with some constituent molecules producing therapeutic effects and others being less beneficial or even contributing to undesirable side effects.
 Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics may achieve superior pharmacological properties compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. Our platform is designed to enable us to rationally design, optimize and produce stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics, which were previously thought to be too difficult to make and too expensive to manufacture. Through proprietary rational design, we are also able to develop phosphodiester/phosphorothioate (“PO/PS”) modified combinations in our nucleic acids, allowing for judicious and specific use of PS modifications, with the ability to reduce the number of PS linkages in a molecule. We believe this ability to selectively employ PS modification where desired may provide further control over pharmacodynamics and may improve the safety of our product candidates. Further, our platform has the potential to design therapies that use any of the major molecular mechanisms employed by nucleic acid therapeutics, including antisense, ribonucleic acid interference (“RNAi”), splicing and exon skipping, as described below. 
 
Our goal is to develop and commercialize disease-modifying drugs for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. We are focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. Our initial focus for our clinical development programs is in neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the central nervous system (“CNS”) and neuromuscular system. We have initiated clinical trials of our two lead programs in Huntington’s disease (“HD”) and our lead program in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) targeting exon 51. In 2018, we expect to initiate three additional development programs, targeting exon 53 in DMD and C9ORF72 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”). In addition to neurology, we continue to advance discovery research in ophthalmologic and hepatic diseases. We are also leveraging our platform to explore the next generation of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics that have the potential to selectively target certain cell types. We believe that we are well positioned to achieve our goals and attain our objective of becoming a fully integrated biotechnology company because our team is comprised of leaders in the field of nucleic acid therapeutics, including world renowned scientists, leading researchers and executives with proven track records in drug discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics.

Recent Developments
 In February 2018, we entered into a global strategic collaboration (the “Takeda Collaboration”) that provides Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) with the option to co-develop and co-commercialize our CNS development programs in HD, ALS and FTD, as well as a discovery-stage program targeting ATXN3 for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (“SCA3”). In addition, Takeda has the right to license multiple preclinical programs for CNS indications including Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”). Subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “HSR Act”), the Takeda Collaboration is expected to become effective during Q1 2018. A description of the Takeda Collaboration is included under “Business – Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations – Our Partnerships.” 
 We continue to independently advance development programs and research in neuromuscular diseases, including our lead programs for the treatment of DMD. We also have ongoing programs to further leverage our stereochemistry platform in other therapeutic areas, including ophthalmology, with our wholly-owned discovery programs and hepatic diseases in collaboration with Pfizer.
 Our Current Programs
 
 
1. | Estimates of U.S. prevalence and addressable population by target based on publicly available data and are approximate; for Huntington’s disease, numbers approximate manifest and pre-manifest populations, respectively
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | During a four-year term, Wave and Takeda may collaborate on up to six preclinical targets at any one time
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Pfizer has nominated two undisclosed targets in addition to APOC3
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Wave’s collaboration agreement with Takeda is not effective until satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additional details regarding our programs are set forth below. 
 Neurology: CNS
  
• | In HD, we are advancing two separate programs, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, each targeting a disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (“SNP”) within the huntingtin gene (“HTT”): rs362307 (“HTT SNP1”) and rs362331 (“HTT SNP2”), respectively. SNPs are naturally occurring variations within a given genetic sequence and in certain instances can be used to distinguish between two related copies of a gene where only one is associated with the expression of a disease-causing protein. We have shown that by targeting HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2 in preclinical models, the production of disease-causing proteins associated with HD can be reduced. In July 2017, we initiated PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2, global Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively. We expect top-line data from these trials in H1 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | In ALS and FTD, we are advancing WVE-3972-01, which targets the transcript containing the GGGGCC (“G4C2”) expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. The G4C2 expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD and is a strong genetic risk factor for non-inherited (sporadic) forms of ALS and FTD. We expect to initiate clinical trials of WVE-3972-01 in ALS and FTD in Q4 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In SCA3, we expect to have a candidate targeting ATXN3 identified by the end of 2018.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions, we will collaborate with Takeda to advance genetically defined targets for the treatment of CNS disorders, including AD and PD. Under the terms of the agreement, we may collaborate with Takeda on up to six preclinical programs at any one time, during a four-year term. Takeda is entitled to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs during the term.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neurology: Muscle 
  
• | In DMD, we are advancing WVE-210201, which targets exon 51, a region within the precursor messenger RNA (“pre-mRNA”) that is transcribed from the dystrophin gene (also referred to as the “DMD” gene). DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene that results in dysfunctional dystrophin protein. In November 2017, we initiated a global Phase 1 clinical trial of WVE-210201 administered intravenously. Safety data from the Phase 1 clinical trial are anticipated in Q3 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We also are advancing programs targeting additional DMD exons. In September 2017, we announced that our next DMD development program will target exon 53, and we expect to initiate clinical trials in Q1 2019. In addition, we are exploring subcutaneous administration for all of our DMD programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have initiated research to identify potential targets for additional neuromuscular diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ophthalmology 
  
• | In genetic ophthalmologic diseases, we have conducted preclinical research into the development of stereopure compounds and tested the hypothesis that controlling the chirality of PS linkages in the backbones of oligonucleotides will provide benefits in potency, distribution and duration of effect in the eye. In these studies, we have employed MALAT1 as a surrogate target. We have evaluated lead stereopure oligonucleotides in vivo following single intravitreal injection in mouse and non-human primate (“NHP”) eyes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hepatic
  
• | We are collaborating with Pfizer to advance genetically defined targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, bringing together our proprietary drug development platform across antisense and single-stranded RNAi modalities, along with GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology for delivery to the liver. Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer may select, and we will advance, up to five targets from discovery through the selection of clinical candidates, at which point Pfizer may elect to exclusively license the programs and undertake further development and potential commercialization. Two targets were declared upon initiation of the agreement, including Apolipoprotein C-III (“APOC3”). In Q3 2016, Pfizer nominated its third target. Per the terms of the agreement amended in November 2017, Pfizer is entitled to nominate up to two additional targets by May 2018.

Our R&D Platform and Proprietary Technology 
 We believe that our proprietary synthetic chemistry platform is an engine for nucleic acid drug development and places us in a unique position to deliver medicines to patient populations where no meaningful therapies are available. We believe that, in combination with our candidate discovery, design and selection process, our platform technology can potentially be applied to treat a significant number of indications, which span multiple therapeutic areas and are addressable by employing the most suited modality based on the biology and our empirical evidence. 
 Our novel platform technology enables the development of PO/PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize therapeutically optimized, stereopure nucleic acids. Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to synthesize stereopure nucleic acids with position-specific PS modifications, meaning drugs where the configuration of each chiral PS linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis, at scale. Our unique approach also enables us to use rational drug design, whereby we either employ the conventional wisdom of small-molecule drug development or discover new design principles that govern nucleic acids and apply these insights to therapeutic development. After identifying a target sequence, we determine the most suitable modality, such as RNAi, antisense or exon skipping, and we precisely control the stereochemistry of our oligonucleotides based on the target and the modality. We believe 
 5

that our rational and methodical approach enables the optimization of several key elements of drug design, including stability, specificity, activity and immunogenicity. We believe that our platform technology can be broadly applied as it is not limited to a particular chemistry or nucleotide sequence, thereby creating opportunities to optimize it across a larger number of therapeutic areas. 
 We also believe that we have a strong intellectual property position relating to the development and commercialization of our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutic candidates. Our intellectual property portfolio includes filings designed to protect stereopure oligonucleotide compositions generally, as well as filings designed to protect stereopure compositions of oligonucleotides with particular stereochemical patterns (for example, that affect or confer biological activity). Our portfolio also includes filings for both proprietary methods and reagents, as well as various chemical methodologies that enable production of such stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. In addition, our portfolio includes filings designed to protect methods of using stereopure oligonucleotide compositions and filings designed to protect particular stereopure oligonucleotide products, such as those having a particular sequence, pattern of nucleoside and/or backbone modification, pattern of backbone linkages and/or a pattern of backbone chiral centers. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are leveraging our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform to design, develop and commercialize optimized disease-modifying nucleic acid therapeutics for indications with a high degree of unmet medical need in genetically defined diseases. We are focused on designing single-stranded nucleic acid therapeutics that can distribute broadly within the human body, allowing us to target diseases across multiple organ systems and tissues, through both systemic and local administration. Our initial programs are focused in neurology and are aimed at addressing HD, DMD, ALS and FTD. In parallel to our neurology programs, we are exploring additional therapeutic areas that may benefit from the application of our platform. 
 The key components of our strategy are as follows: 
  
• | Maintain and extend our leadership in oligonucleotides. We intend to establish a dominant position in the field of oligonucleotides, advancing basic research and pharmacology using stereochemistry across multiple therapeutic modalities and target classes. Our efforts are already revealing structure-activity relationships amongst chemical modification, stereochemistry and pharmacology that may allow us to tune the activity of our oligonucleotides in a previously unexplored modality-specific manner.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance our clinical development programs. We are advancing three programs currently in clinical development: WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, targeting HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2, respectively, in HD, and WVE-210201 targeting exon 51 in DMD. We expect to deliver safety data from our Phase 1 trial in DMD in Q3 2018 and top-line data from our two Phase 1b/2a trials in HD in H1 2019. We intend to initiate clinical trials of WVE-3972-01 in ALS and FTD in Q4 2018 and of our program targeting exon 53 in DMD in Q1 2019.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sustain our leadership in neurology. We are committed to transforming the care of rare genetic diseases in neurology, which we broadly define as CNS and the neuromuscular system. Our current neurology development programs offer a foundation from which to transform our company into a fully integrated commercial organization. We also believe there are additional areas within neurology, specifically neurodegenerative movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases beyond DMD and neurodegenerative dementias, that we can uniquely address with our chemistry platform to reach underserved patient populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our pipeline. We remain intent on making disciplined investments in our platform to enable a sustainable discovery and development engine for future growth. We believe our platform will yield optimized nucleic acid therapeutic candidates to deepen our pipeline in neurologic and hepatic diseases, as well as to allow us to broaden our pipeline into additional therapeutic areas, such as ophthalmology. We will continue to pursue these investments through wholly-owned programs as well as through potential partnerships and collaborations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage manufacturing leadership in stereopure oligonucleotides. We expect that our manufacturing capabilities based in our Lexington, Massachusetts facility, and our growing internal expertise in current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), specifically for stereopure oligonucleotides, will better facilitate our growth and enhances our ability to secure drug product for current and future development activities and, potentially, commercial-scale manufacturing. In July 2017, we took occupancy of the approximately 90,000 square foot multi-use Lexington facility and began manufacturing production in Q4 2017.

Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 The majority of traditional therapeutics, such as small molecule drugs and biologics, work by interacting with proteins that contribute to the disease. However, there are thought to be a limited number of “druggable” proteins; it is currently estimated that approximately 80% of human protein targets cannot be addressed by these conventional approaches. In contrast, we believe that directing medicines to the RNA, which is critical to the production of proteins, rather than to the proteins themselves, has the potential to significantly increase the number of druggable targets. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics are an innovative class of drugs that can modulate the function of target RNAs to ultimately affect the production of disease-associated proteins or prevent the accumulation of pathogenic RNA species, which are emerging as important factors in human disease. Nucleic acid therapeutics can regulate protein and RNA via several different molecular mechanisms. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized as silencing, those that promote degradation of the target RNA, including antisense and RNAi; splicing, those that involve binding to the target RNA and modulating its function by promoting exon skipping; and RNA-guided gene editing. 
 The unique capability of nucleic acid therapeutics to address a wide range of genomic targets that impact multiple therapeutic areas creates potentially significant market opportunities for us to develop drugs to treat a broad spectrum of human diseases, including diseases where no medicines currently exist or for which existing treatments are not optimal. 
 The nucleic acid therapeutics we are currently developing employ the following molecular mechanisms: 
  
• | Antisense, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a specific sequence in a target RNA strand that encodes a disease-associated protein or pathogenic RNA. The resulting two-stranded molecule (“duplex”) is then recognized by a cellular enzyme called RNase H, which cleaves, or cuts, the target RNA in the duplex, thereby preventing the disease-associated protein from being made.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA interference (“RNAi”), which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to recognize a specific sequence and engages RNAi machinery known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (“RISC”) to silence a target RNA that is either pathogenic itself or encodes a disease-associated protein, thereby preventing the accumulation of the pathogenic species (RNA or protein).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Splicing, which is the processing of a nascent pre-mRNA transcript into messenger RNA (“mRNA”) by removing introns and joining exons together.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exon skipping, which uses a therapeutic oligonucleotide designed to bind to a particular sequence within a target pre-mRNA and direct the cellular machinery to delete, or splice out, certain specific regions of that RNA. Often, the underlying mutation in the target RNA leads to a “stop” instruction, so that, absent the therapeutic oligonucleotide, non-productive mRNA yields no functional protein. Use of the exon-skipping modality permits the cellular machinery to correct the “stop” instruction and assemble a partially functional protein, thereby mitigating or alleviating the disease that would otherwise result.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics are largely comprised of chemically modified, short-length RNA or deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) strands, commonly known as oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides are comprised of a sequence of nucleotides—the building blocks of RNA and DNA—that are linked together by a backbone of chemical bonds. In nucleic acid molecules that have not been modified for therapeutic use, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester (“PO”) bonds, as shown below. 
 
7

Such unmodified nucleic acid molecules are unsuitable for use as therapeutics because they are rapidly degraded by enzymes called nucleases that are widely distributed in the human body, are rapidly cleared by the kidneys and are taken up poorly by targeted cells. The industry has employed chemical modifications of the nucleotides and PO bonds that improve the stability, biodistribution and cellular uptake of nucleic acid therapeutics. 
 The phosphorothioate (“PS”) modification was one of the earliest and remains one of the most common backbone modifications used in nucleic acid therapeutics. When introducing a PS modification, one of the nonbridging oxygen (O) atoms bonded to a phosphorus (P) atom is replaced with a sulfur (S) atom. This modification improves the stability of oligonucleotides by making them less susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Further, PS bond-containing oligonucleotides increase binding to plasma proteins, which improves biodistribution by preventing rapid renal excretion of these molecules. 
 Whereas traditional chemistry platforms for nucleic acid therapeutics require the full replacement of the naturally occurring PO with PS, we can judiciously use a combination of PO and PS in our stereopure nucleic acids. We believe this flexibility to selectively employ PS modifications only where desired may provide control over pharmacodynamics and may improve the safety of our drugs. 
 Nucleic acid therapeutics are a relatively “new” class of drugs from the perspective of regulatory approvals. The first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of a nucleic acid therapeutic occurred in 1998, and the most recent was in 2016. Nucleic acid therapeutic candidates that employ PS modifications are being developed by several different companies. PS modification is accepted as a state-of-the-art advancement in the field. We believe that PS modification will remain a key component of nucleic acid therapeutic development. 
 PS Modification Results in Complex Drug Mixtures 
 A consequence of introducing PS modifications into an oligonucleotide is that it also introduces a chiral center at each phosphorus, creating stereoisomers designated as either an “Sp” or “Rp” isomer. As shown below, these stereoisomers have identical chemical compositions but different three-dimensional arrangements of their atoms and consequently different chemical and biological properties. 
 
8

The isomeric configuration at each PS modification is random (either Rp or Sp) during conventional nucleic acid therapeutic synthesis. Because oligonucleotides contain a string of nucleotides with associated PS modifications, the synthesis process generates a complex mixture containing many stereoisomers. Specifically, each PS linkage doubles the number of stereoisomers in the product, so that a conventional preparation of a PS-containing oligonucleotide contains 2N stereoisomers, where N represents the number of PS modifications. As shown below, a conventional, fully PS-modified oligonucleotide (20 nucleotides in length, 19 PS modifications) is a mixture of over 500,000 stereoisomers, each having the same nucleotide sequence but differing in the stereochemistry along their backbones. 
 
Stereoisomers can possess different chemical and pharmacological properties. For example, certain stereoisomers can drive the therapeutic effects of a drug while others can be less beneficial or can even contribute to undesirable side effects. The greater the variation among a drug’s constituent stereoisomers, the greater the potential to diminish the drug’s efficacy and safety. 
 Prior to the development of our technology, it was not possible to create stereopure PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics, meaning drugs where the configuration of each chiral PS linkage is precisely controlled during chemical synthesis. Moreover, because of the sheer number of stereoisomers present in a mixture, it would be impractical, if not impossible, to physically isolate the most therapeutically optimal stereoisomer from within a mixture. For these reasons, all PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics currently on the market and in development by others are mixtures of many stereoisomers, which we believe are not optimized for stability, catalytic activity, efficacy or toxicity. 
 In small molecule therapeutics, U.S. regulators have long sought to eliminate the risks potentially posed by drug mixtures containing multiple stereoisomers. Since 1992, the FDA has recommended full molecular characterization of stereoisomers within small-molecule drug mixtures. Historically, it has not been possible to achieve such characterization for nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures, which can contain tens of thousands to millions of distinct pharmacological entities. Based on our published and ongoing preclinical studies, we believe that we can design and synthesize stereopure PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics that demonstrate superior pharmacological properties compared with mixture-based nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe that our drug development platform has the potential to set a new industry standard for the molecular characterization of complex nucleic acid therapeutic drug mixtures. 
 Our Solution: Controlling Stereochemistry and Employing Rational Design in Nucleic Acid Therapeutics 
 We have developed proprietary chemistry that enables the development of PO/PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutics in which stereochemistry is precisely controlled. This degree of control enables us to both rationally design and synthesize optimized stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. We have published both our proprietary chemistry platform and its application to synthesize stereopure oligonucleotides in Nature Biotechnology (Iwamoto N, et al. Nature Biotechnol. 2017;35(9):845-851). 
 We have discovered and expect to continuously elaborate on the relationships between the chemical makeup of an oligonucleotide, including the three-dimensional orientation or arrangement of its atoms, and its pharmacology (i.e., stability of the drug, activity against the target, specificity for the target and immunogenicity of the drug). Our initial findings relating the stereochemical make up of oligonucleotides to their pharmacology were also featured in our Nature Biotechnology publication. In addition, we have defined relationships between various 2’-sugar modifications to the nucleotide (such as methoxy, methoxyethyl, fluoro, locked), and the stereochemistry of the backbone that enhances oligonucleotide pharmacology, providing an enhanced therapeutic profile. 
 9

Our rational process for designing stereopure oligonucleotides combining chemistry, stereochemistry and natural phosphate linkages allows us to selectively optimize for the molecular mechanism in order to generate best-in-class nucleic acid therapeutics. We are using these ongoing discoveries to guide our drug development activities that we believe will lead to drugs that can be dosed at lower concentrations, less frequently, or both, as well as with improved therapeutic profiles.
 Advantages of Our Approach 
 We believe that our innovative and proprietary synthetic chemistry drug development platform is a significant advance in the development of nucleic acid therapeutics. The advantages of our approach include: 

• | Ability to rationally design drugs with optimized pharmacological properties. Our platform reduces susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and renal clearance compared with traditional oligonucleotide therapeutics (stereomixtures or stereorandom oligonucleotides), and optimizes their interactions with proteins that mediate their activity, as well as those that affect their safety and tolerability. Our ability to improve pharmacological stability and reduce clearance can enhance the biodistribution of single-stranded oligonucleotides to multiple tissues following systemic administration without the need for additional delivery technology. Our ability to improve activity against and selectivity for our intended target mRNA, which in combination with stability, translates into improved in vivo target engagement and durability of response.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad applicability. Our platform is applicable to nucleic acid therapeutics acting via multiple molecular mechanisms, including antisense, RNAi, exon skipping, splicing, RNA-guided gene editing, microRNA and others, and is compatible with a broad range of chemical modifications and targeting moieties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary production of stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics. Our scientists have developed expertise in the techniques required to produce adequate supplies of PS-modified, stereopure nucleic acid therapeutic materials for our preclinical and planned clinical activities. In addition, we believe we have the intellectual property position and know-how necessary to protect, advance and scale these production processes to support our clinical trials and potential future commercial supply.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability and Manufacturing. Our manufacturing process and technical expertise in designing stereopure oligonucleotides is unique in nucleic acid therapeutics. We believe that our scalable synthesis processes will allow us to meet demand for cGMP-qualified clinical trial supply, as well as the potential for commercial manufacturing at a cost of goods and potential cost-per-patient that are comparable to traditional methods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Proprietary Chemistry – Proof of Concept 
 In preclinical models, which we believe are predictive of human biology, we have demonstrated that stereochemistry and pharmacology are directly related, and that these relationships inform the rational design and production of nucleic acid therapeutics. In proof-of-concept studies, we have used our platform to design and synthesize diverse sets of oligonucleotides, which allowed us to characterize and compare the behavior of various stereoisomers. These preclinical studies, some of which have been published in Nature Biotechnology, have demonstrated that by controlling stereochemistry, we can optimize multiple aspects of pharmacology, including stability, catalytic activity, efficacy, specificity, immunogenicity and enhanced delivery, which in turn, we believe will lead to an enhanced therapeutic profile. As with any drug under development, we cannot be certain that the same favorable pharmacological properties we have observed in preclinical studies for our stereopure nucleic acid therapeutics will translate to humans. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Discovery, Manufacturing, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates” for a discussion of the risks associated with the development of pharmaceuticals, and nucleic acid therapeutics in particular. 
 In our Nature Biotechnology paper, we describe our studies using stereopure oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide mixtures based on mipomersen. We studied mipomersen because, at that time, it was the only systemically administered nucleic acid therapeutic approved for commercialization, and documents from the regulatory bodies that evaluated mipomersen for marketing approval were publicly available. Mipomersen (currently marketed by Kastle Therapeutics and formerly marketed by Sanofi Genzyme, under the brand name Kynamro®) is approved for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and is designed to silence production of Apolipoprotein B (“APOB”) via an antisense mechanism. Although mipomersen received marketing authorization in the United States in 2012, concerns about the drug’s tolerability and liver and cardiovascular safety led the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) to refuse to grant marketing authorization for the drug in the European Union. One of the EMA’s central concerns about mipomersen was that a high proportion of patients stopped taking the drug within two years, mainly due to side effects such as flu-like symptoms, injection-site reactions and liver toxicity. The EMA considered these side effects important because mipomersen is intended for long-term treatment to maintain its cholesterol-lowering effect. 
 Mipomersen, an oligonucleotide containing 20 nucleotides and 19 PS modifications, is synthesized by traditional oligonucleotide chemistry; thus, it is actually a mixture of over 500,000 different stereoisomers (219 = 524,288). We rationally designed and synthesized individual stereoisomers of mipomersen, each having position-specific and distinct stereochemistry, and conducted studies comparing these defined stereoisomers with the mipomersen stereomixture. 
 10

Stability 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and stability by exposing our panel of individual stereoisomers and the stereomixture to metabolic enzymes, including nucleases, in rat liver homogenate or rat serum. We incubated each stereoisomer or the stereomixture separately in rat whole-liver homogenate for five days at physiological temperature and measured the percentage of each full-length stereoisomer and the stereomixture remaining daily. We found that stereochemistry had a profound impact on oligonucleotide stability. 
 As shown in the graph below, by day five, less than 15% of the stereomixture (mipomersen) remained. By contrast at day five, over 50% of our stereopure isomers 1, 2, 3 and 4 remained, with isomer 1 showing minimal degradation, indicating that these individual stereopure isomers have greater stability than the stereomixture. The mipomersen stereomixture, however, was more stable than several other stereoisomers (i.e., 5, 6 and 7).
 

We obtained similar results when we assessed the stability of the stereomixture and selected stereoisomers in rat serum. Overall, we found that increasing the proportion of Sp isomers increased the stability of the oligonucleotides.
 11

Catalytic Activity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and catalytic activity, which, in the case of the antisense modality, is a measure of the efficiency with which the drug leads to the knockdown of the target. In the human body, antisense drugs like mipomersen rely on the enzyme RNase H to degrade or knockdown the target mRNA. Yielding efficient RNase H catalytic activity is an essential pharmacological feature for drugs like mipomersen. 
 We evaluated the catalytic activity of the same panel of stereoisomers described above in in vitro enzymatic assays using human RNase H. We added RNase H to pre-formed duplexes containing the stereoisomers or the stereomixture bound to the target APOB mRNA, and we assessed the relative rates of target RNA degradation. To do this, we stopped the reactions at designated time points and quantified the amount of full-length APOB mRNA remaining. 
 As shown below, the catalytic activity of the stereoisomers and the stereomixture differed considerably, as demonstrated by their efficiency in reducing the amount of the full-length target remaining over time. Certain stereoisomers, most notably stereoisomer 4, was far more catalytically active than the stereomixture as well as other stereoisomers. Importantly, stereoisomer 4 contains a pattern of PS stereochemistry denoted 3’-SpSpRp-5’ (“SSR”). We also identified stereoisomers with distinct patterns of PS stereochemistry that were less catalytically active than the stereomixture, most notably isomer 7. 
 
Based on these and other data, we have established key design principles (i.e., the SSR motif) relating stereochemistry to RNase H catalytic activity. These principles can now be applied across antisense therapeutics and are compatible with a broad range of additional chemical modifications to the drug molecule.
 Based on these studies and others, we believe we can synthesize stereopure versions of any PS-modified nucleic acid therapeutic that possesses increased stability and catalytic activity, independent of nucleotide sequence. 
 Efficacy
 We assessed whether improved stability and catalytic activity of our stereoisomers would translate into greater efficacy in an in vivo pharmacological study. We administered our panel of stereoisomers and the stereomixture to transgenic mice that express human APOB. This validated animal model was included in the preclinical package used for the regulatory approval of mipomersen in the United States. 
 We injected mice twice weekly with 10 mg/kg of stereoisomer 3, stereoisomer 5, or the stereomixture over a four-week period. We measured APOB protein levels in the serum weekly for six weeks. This treatment protocol and study design replicates the preclinical in vivo pharmacology study that was included in the regulatory submission for mipomersen. 
 12

In the experiment, stereoisomer 3, which demonstrated increased catalytic activity and stability in vitro compared with the stereomixture and stereoisomer 5, led to greater reduction in serum APOB protein than either the stereomixture or stereoisomer 5. These data are illustrated in the graph below, where levels of APOB in serum, expressed as a percentage of APOB at baseline, is plotted with respect to time (days). Knockdown of APOB by the stereomixture (mipomersen) and stereoisomer 5 decreased dramatically following final dose (after day 28). In contrast, stereoisomer 3 demonstrated efficient and sustained target engagement, as evidenced by the magnitude and duration of knockdown, which persisted for over two weeks after the final dose.
 
To demonstrate that stereochemistry can be deployed as a generalizable feature, we applied our design to an antisense nucleic acid with a different sequence and chemistry. In this experiment, we generated a single stereopure stereoisomer, containing the SSR motif, and compared it with a stereorandom isomer of the same sequence. Both were designed to target APOC3 mRNA, which is predominately expressed in the liver. These isomers were also chemically modified with a GalNAc moiety, which improves their access to the liver. To demonstrate in vivo efficacy and durability of response, we administered the isomers to mice harboring a human APOC3 transgene (B6.Cg-Tg(APOC3)2Bres/J), and we assessed knockdown activity by measuring serum APOC3 protein. Similar to the results shown above, the stereopure isomer led to more efficient knockdown of APOC3 (ED50=0.3 mg/kg for stereopure vs. ED50=~2.0 mg/kg for the stereorandom isomer) (left panel in figure below) that persisted much longer than that for the stereorandom isomer (right panel in figure below).
 
These data demonstrate that two pharmacological properties that we can control through stereochemistry, increasing in vitro stability with Sp isomers and increasing in vitro catalytic activity with the SSR motif, translate to improvements in important in vivo pharmacological properties, including target engagement and durability of response. In addition to these findings, we have also observed significant target engagement of our stereoisomers in numerous tissues, including eye, liver, muscle and CNS.

Specificity 
 By controlling stereochemistry, we have discovered that we can change the pattern of RNase H cleavage in the target mRNA that is caused by PS-modified antisense. Indeed, we can use stereochemistry to direct cleavage toward specific positions within the target. This precision control enables us to design PS-modified nucleic acids that can direct RNase H to differentiate between two very similar targets. This level of specificity is desirable in cases where cleavage of one target is expected to have disease-modifying impacts, but cleavage of a closely related target is undesirable or potentially unsafe. 
 For example, HD is caused by mutations in one allele (which is one of two or more versions of a gene) of the HTT gene, resulting in the production of a disease-causing protein, while the other allele encodes a healthy protein. By optimizing stereochemistry, we can direct cleavage towards the mutated HTT allele based on a single-nucleotide difference between the disease-causing allele and the normal allele. 
 In the experiment illustrated below, we performed in vitro RNase H enzymatic reactions similar to those presented previously. As before, we added RNase H to stereopure oligonucleotides or stereorandom oligonucleotides that were duplexed with mutant or healthy HTT RNA. We stopped the reactions at designated time points and quantified the amount of full-length mutant or healthy HTT RNA remaining. The stereorandom oligonucleotide (left panel) caused substantial reductions in both the mutant and healthy HTT RNA, whereas the optimized stereopure oligonucleotide (right panel) preferentially cleaved mutant HTT RNA while largely sparing the healthy HTT RNA. 
 

We believe that our ability to use stereochemistry to precisely control the RNase H cleavage patterns resulting from PS-modified nucleic acids allows us to mitigate unwanted activity in vivo. This affords us a unique position to make allele-specific targeting (meaning the preferential interaction of an oligonucleotide with RNA transcribed from only one allele of a given gene) possible. 
 Through these preclinical studies, we have demonstrated the ability to use stereochemistry to precisely control cleavage and reduce off-target cleavage. We believe these findings can be applied in the design of nucleic acid therapies for a range of disease targets. 
 Immunogenicity 
 We investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and immunogenicity, which is the ability of a substance to activate an immune response. Immune activation has been observed with PS-modified oligonucleotides in preclinical toxicology studies. Flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions in clinical studies are believed to be immune mediated. 
 14

Using NHP serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to our panel of individual stereopure isomers and the parent stereomixture. We incubated each isomer and stereomixture at physiological temperature in NHP serum from three individual animals. We removed samples from these incubations at designated times, and we assessed complement activation by measuring the increase in the amount of protein C3a. Protein C3a is formed when the complement system is activated and complement component 3 is cleaved. C3a levels in serum increase in direct proportion to the amount of pathway activation. We quantified serum C3a levels using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) analytical method, a technique used to determine the amount of a specific protein present in a biological sample. 
 As shown below, the stereoisomers and the stereomixture yielded different levels of complement pathway activation as measured by C3a production. Certain stereoisomers, such as stereoisomers 1 and 2, showed less than half of the C3a production compared with the stereomixture (shown in black). 
 

15

We have also assayed immune activation of stereoisomers and the parent stereomixture in a human TLR9 reporter assay (left panel below) and a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (“PBMC”) cytokine panel (right panel below, IL-6 and MIP-1β are key cytokines in B-cell and macrophage activation, respectively). In the TLR9 assay, the 5’methylcytosine (“5mC”)-modified stereomixture activated TLR9 activity, whereas our stereopure isomer did not. Similarly, the 5mC-modified stereomixture (Isomer-1) led to IL-6 and MIP-1β secretion from PBMCs, where our stereopure isomer (Isomer-2) did not. Prior research has indicated that 5mC and 2’-modifications to a nucleic acid therapeutic containing the immune-activating CpG motif are sufficient to limit immune activation. However, substantial immune activation persists even when these modifications are incorporated, as seen in these experiments. Our chemistry platform allows us to design stereoisomers that yield notably less activation of the immune system.


Based on these studies, we believe that it is possible to modulate complement activation and potentially reduce the immunogenicity of PS-modified oligonucleotides by controlling stereochemistry.
 

Enhanced Delivery
 We have also investigated the relationship between stereochemistry and cellular uptake, which is the ability of nucleic acid therapeutics to penetrate cells and access the appropriate subcellular compartment (i.e., the nucleus) for them to engage with their intended target. Designing oligonucleotides that enter cells at sufficient concentrations to provide a therapeutic effect has been a challenge for the nucleic acid therapeutics field.
 As shown below, we performed an intracellular trafficking assay using differentiating myoblast cell lines to compare the cellular localization of stereopure and stereorandom oligonucleotides in vitro. We washed and fixed treated cells and detected the oligonucleotides using a ViewRNA assay and an immunofluorescence microscope with deconvolution capabilities. Z-stacks were taken to eliminate artifacts. We compared the number of oligonucleotide foci (red, left panel below) in the nucleus (blue) of cultured cells that we treated with either a stereorandom oligonucleotide or one of our stereopure oligonucleotides. We detected substantially more foci per nucleus for our stereopure oligonucleotide compared with a stereorandom oligonucleotide of comparable sequence (right panel below).

Our Initial Therapeutic Programs
 Our most advanced therapeutic programs are in neurology, which we broadly define as genetic diseases within the CNS and neuromuscular system. Within neurology, we are focused on HD, DMD, ALS, FTD and we have initiated discovery research in SCA3. We have initiated clinical trials of our two lead programs in HD and our lead program in DMD targeting exon 51. In 2018, we expect to initiate three additional development programs, targeting exon 53 in DMD and C9ORF72 in ALS and FTD. As a component of our neurology focus, we continue to advance research to identify potential candidates for the treatment of SCA3 and explore additional targets relevant to CNS and neuromuscular disorders.
 See below for more information on these programs and the respective diseases we are targeting. 
 Huntington’s Disease 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 HD is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease that results in early death and for which there is no cure. HD is caused by a mutation (i.e. an expanded CAG triplet repeat) in the HTT gene, which results in production of mutant HTT (“mHTT”) protein. Accumulation of mHTT protein causes progressive loss of neurons in the brain, and can lead to neuronal cell death, causing cognitive, psychiatric and motor disability. HD patients still possess wild-type (healthy) HTT (“wtHTT”) protein, which is believed to be critical for neuronal function. Accordingly, suppression of wtHTT may have detrimental long-term consequences. Absence of wtHTT protein has been shown to be embryonically lethal in mice. 
 Symptoms of HD typically appear between the ages of 30 and 50 and worsen over the next 10 to 20 years. Many describe the symptoms of HD as similar to having ALS, PD and AD simultaneously. Patients experience a reduction in motor function and psychological disturbances. Life expectancy after symptom onset is approximately 20 years. In the most symptomatic stages, often lasting over ten years, affected persons become fully dependent upon others to manage all activities of daily living; they lose the ability to make decisions, feed themselves and walk, often requiring premature placement in a long-term care facility. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people in the United States have symptomatic HD and more than 200,000 others have a 50% risk for inheriting the disorder from their affected parent. 
 Current Treatments 
 There are no approved treatments that can reverse or slow HD progression. Current pharmacological therapies only address HD symptoms. Antipsychotics are used to manage depression, irritability and chorea (involuntary movements). Xenazine® (tetrabenazine) and AustedoTM (deutetrabenazine) are the only two therapies approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD in the United States. 
 17

Our Programs
 We have advanced two investigational stereopure 
oligonucleotides into clinical trials, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, which target SNPs associated with the mutant allele of the HTT gene. The precise targeting of the mutant allele by stereopure oligonucleotides should allow discrimination and selective silencing of the mHTT mRNA transcripts that lead to the production of the mHTT protein associated with disease manifestations, while leaving wild-type (healthy) HTT transcripts and protein relatively intact (see figure below). 
 WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 are designed to selectively target HTT SNP1 and HTT SNP2 on the mHTT allele, respectively. These are two of the most common SNPs associated with the mHTT allele, which are believed to encompass up to 70% of the HD patient population. If approved, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 would be the first allele-specific disease-modifying therapies for HD patients. Our allele-specific approach may also enable us to address the pre-manifest HD patient population in the future.
 
In July 2017, we initiated our clinical trial program for HD, PRECISION-HD. PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 are global Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively. We expect top-line data from these clinical trials in H1 2019. PRECISION-HD1 and PRECISION-HD2 are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, administered intrathecally in early manifest HD patients. Additional exploratory objectives include assessing the impact that each compound has on levels of mHTT protein, as well as evaluating potential clinical effects and impact on brain atrophy as measured by magnetic resonance imaging. We intend to enroll approximately 50 patients globally in each of the two studies at multiple clinical trial sites. In 2016 and 2017, we were granted orphan drug designation under the Orphan Drug Act by the FDA for our product candidates, WVE-120101 and WVE-120102, respectively, for the treatment of HD.
 18

In our preclinical studies, as shown below, the stereopure oligonucleotide WVE-120101 (circles) or a stereorandom oligonucleotide (triangles) were bound to wtHTT or mHTT mRNA and incubated with human RNase H (left panel). WVE-120101 produced greater knockdown of mHTT compared with the stereorandom oligonucleotide. In addition, WVE-120101 was selective for mHTT over wtHTT, producing relatively little knockdown of wtHTT. The stereorandom oligonucleotide was not selective and knocked down both wtHTT and mHTT. 
 
Using NHP serum, we analyzed the activation of the complement system following exposure to a panel of stereopure oligonucleotides and the parent stereorandom oligonucleotide, which were designed to target HTT. Each oligonucleotide was incubated at physiological temperature in NHP serum from three individual animals. Samples were removed at the indicated times, and complement activation was measured by the increase in C3a levels using the ELISA analytical method. As shown above (right panel), certain stereopure oligonucleotides and the stereorandom oligonucleotide demonstrated increased production of C3a; however, there was no production of C3a following exposure to WVE-120101, which also discriminated between wild-type and mutant HTT.
 
WVE-120101 was tested for potency and selectivity of knocking down mHTT mRNA in a cellular reporter assay. WVE-120101 targeting the mHTT mRNA was co-transfected into HEK293 cells with two reporter plasmids: a plasmid with V5-tagged full-length HTT containing the U-variant SNP1 (mutant) and a plasmid with FLAG-tagged full-length HTT containing the C-variant SNP1 (wild-type). Knockdown of mHTT mRNA and mHTT protein was determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. All results were normalized to a non-specific stereorandom oligonucleotide as a control. As shown below, WVE-120101 potently reduced mHTT mRNA (left panel) and mHTT protein (right panel), and exhibited significant selectivity for mHTT at all doses tested. This study demonstrates the ability to knock down the mHTT allele while leaving the wtHTT (healthy) allele relatively unaffected. 
 
19

Following these promising preclinical experiments, we investigated distribution characteristics of WVE-120101 in NHPs. Based on our preclinical studies, we believe stereochemistry enables improved protein binding and distribution. The figure below demonstrates meaningful distribution of WVE-120101 in an NHP study. In this preclinical study, we employed an in situ hybridization (“ISH”) ViewRNA assay. The ViewRNA assay provides us with the ability to stain oligonucleotides, allowing increased visibility and understanding of the distribution of WVE-120101 in the brain. As shown below, we found perinuclear and nuclear distribution of WVE-120101 (red) in NHP gray matter structures following intrathecal administration. The NHP ViewRNA assay demonstrated broad tissue distribution, including in the cortex and striatum. These findings are encouraging as we believe that distribution and penetration into several areas of the brain will be critical for the successful treatment of HD.

 Preclinical studies on WVE-120102 showed similar results with regard to RNase H-mediated activity, mHTT allele specificity, and distribution in NHP brain. 
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Background and Market Opportunity 
 DMD is a rare, genetic progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene on the X chromosome that affects approximately one in 3,500 newborn boys around the world (approximately 20,000 new cases annually). The dystrophin protein is part of a protein complex called the dystrophin-associated protein complex that acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell’s structural framework with a lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell through the muscle cell membrane. The dystrophin-associated protein complex protects the muscle from injury during contraction and relaxation. Patients with DMD typically develop muscle weakness in the early years of life and become wheelchair-bound in their early teens. As the disease progresses, DMD patients typically develop respiratory, orthopedic and cardiac complications. Cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties usually begin by the age of 20, and few individuals with DMD live beyond their thirties. 
Current Treatments 
 While there are approved therapies for DMD, there is no cure, and there continues to be significant unmet medical need. In most countries, corticosteroids are the standard drug therapy, which slows the progression of muscle weakness and delays loss of ambulation by two to three years. In February 2017, the FDA approved Emflaza (deflazacort), the first corticosteroid approved as a treatment in the United States for DMD patients older than five years of age. 
 In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51™ (eteplirsen) received accelerated approval in the United States. The FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to confer clinical benefit in some patients with DMD, who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. According to U.S. accelerated approval guidelines, no clinical benefit needs to be established at the time of FDA approval, and no clinical benefit of eteplirsen has yet been established. Thus, consistent with the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, eteplirsen is being evaluated in a post-marketing approval clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required clinical trial is designed to assess whether eteplirsen improves motor function of DMD patients, who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. Another exon-skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD, BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s drisapersen, received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA in January 2016, indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the application was not ready for approval in its present form. 
 In 2014, PTC Therapeutics’ Translarna™ (ataluren) was the first disease-modifying treatment to receive conditional approval by the EMA for the treatment of ambulatory DMD patients over 5 years of age who have a nonsense mutation (12% of DMD cases) in the DMD gene. In 2016, the EMA did not allow ataluren to convert to full marketing authorization, rather it granted a renewal of the conditional approval. 
 20

Our Programs 
 Based on our interactions with the DMD patient community and DMD patient advocacy groups, we believe that there continues to be a significant unmet medical need in DMD patients despite the availability of eteplirsen in the United States and ataluren in the European Union. We initiated a global Phase 1 clinical trial in WVE-210201, our investigational stereopure oligonucleotide, in November 2017. Approximately 13% of DMD patients have genetic mutations that are amenable to treatment with exon 51 skipping therapy. In addition, we are advancing our next DMD development program of a stereopure oligonucleotide for patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. Available data indicate that a molecule that skips exon 53 could address approximately 8% of DMD patients. We expect to initiate clinical trials of our exon 53 program in Q1 2019. In addition, we are exploring subcutaneous formulations for all of our DMD programs. 
 WVE-210201 was selected for clinical development, in part, based on its ability to demonstrate high exon 51 skipping efficiency and dystrophin protein restoration in patient-derived muscle cells. Efficiency at skipping exon 51 was determined by quantitative RT-PCR following exposure to equal concentrations of oligonucleotides. As shown below, WVE-210201 demonstrated dose-dependent and more potent increases in exon skipping efficiency compared with analogs of eteplirsen and drisapersen. 
 
21

Using patient-derived muscle cells, we analyzed WVE-210201’s impact on protein expression by Western blot after gymnotic uptake, meaning delivery of drug candidate to the cell in the absence of any carriers or conjugation. Results show that WVE-210201 induced a clear dose-dependent restoration of dystrophin protein expression (Western blot shown below). 
 
22

At a 10 µM concentration of each compound (WVE-210201, other Wave isomers and analogs of drisapersen and eteplirsen), we quantified the extent of dystrophin protein restoration in vitro, and found that WVE-210201 and other Wave isomers (WV-isomer 2 and WV-isomer 3) restored dystrophin protein expression to between 50% and 100% of that in normal skeletal lysates (Western blot shown below). Specifically, WVE-210201 restored dystrophin protein expression to 52% of the levels found in normal skeletal muscle tissue lysates versus the approximate 1% restoration observed with other exon-skipping compounds.
 
We have confirmed target engagement of WVE-210201 in an NHP study. We dosed animals with five 30 mg/kg weekly subcutaneous injections of WVE-210201 over four weeks. Tissue samples were collected two days after the final dose, and nested PCR was performed to assess the presence of skipped RNA transcripts. As shown below, we detected skipped transcripts in all treated muscles that we assessed (right panel), indicating that WVE-210201 successfully engaged with DMD pre-mRNA in vivo.
 
23

As conventional oligonucleotides tend to accumulate in the liver and kidney, we also assessed the accumulation of WVE-210201 in the liver and kidney of a dystrophin-deficient mouse model (mdx-23 mice) after a single intravenous 30 mg/kg dose. As shown below, there was significantly less accumulation of WVE-210201 in these tissues up to eight days after dosing compared with an analog of drisapersen.
 
WVE-210201 is being studied in a global multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial. The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and plasma concentrations of single ascending doses of WVE-210201 administered intravenously in DMD patients who have DMD gene mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping therapies. The trial is expected to enroll up to 40 patients between the ages of 5 and 18 years, and the inclusion criteria allow for participation of both ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients, as well as patients who were previously treated with eteplirsen, following an appropriate washout period. Intravenous doses tested in the Phase 1 trial will escalate through a range expected to be clinically relevant. In the United States, we are required to provide data from preclinical studies to the FDA in order to progress to the highest-dose cohorts and planned multi-dose studies. 
 Safety data from the Phase 1 clinical trial for WVE-210201 are expected in Q3 2018 and will facilitate the rapid transition to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose efficacy study in which dystrophin expression and clinical outcomes will be assessed. The clinical program is designed to allow patient participants from the Phase 1 trial to enroll in an open-label extension study in which dosing with WVE-210201 will continue. The open-label extension study and the planned efficacy study are intended to follow the Phase 1 trial and are expected to include an interim efficacy readout of dystrophin expression from muscle biopsies in H2 2019.
 We are leveraging our stereochemistry platform to advance investigational therapies targeting additional DMD-related exons. In September 2017, we announced that our next DMD development program will target exon 53, and we expect to initiate clinical trials in Q1 2019. 
 24

In our in vitro research studies using exon 53-skipping candidates, we have shown that several of our stereopure isomers (WVE 53 Compounds A-D, shown below) induce dose-dependent increases in pre-mRNA skipping in DMD patient-derived myoblasts carrying a deletion of exons 45–52. In these experiments, cells were exposed to stereopure isomers for four days under gymnotic conditions. These initial data, using un-optimized stereopure isomers, show that we can achieve ~20% skipping. 
 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
and Frontotemporal Dementia
 A hexanucleotide G4C2 expansion found in the C9ORF72 gene is the most common cause of familial ALS and FTD and is a strong genetic risk factor for non-inherited (sporadic) forms of ALS and FTD. Some patients exhibit characteristics of both ALS and FTD, indicating that these diseases form part of a continuum of neurological disease with some overlap in symptoms between them. 
 ALS Background and Market Opportunity 
 ALS is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progression and degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosis may take up to 12 months and is made clinically by assessing the signs of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration in the same region of the body. Patients initially present with limb-onset disease (approximately 70% of patients), bulbar-onset disease (approximately 25% of patients) or with initial trunk or respiratory involvement (approximately 5% of patients). Age of onset is generally in the mid-to-late 50’s, and median survival is three years; however, up to 24% of patients survive for five to ten years. Survival in patients with C9ORF72 ALS may be shorter than in patients with sporadic ALS. 
 In the United States and Europe combined, there are approximately three to five ALS patients per 100,000 people. This translates to approximately 13,000 diagnosed patients in the United States, although the total prevalence may be around 20,000. There are one or two newly diagnosed cases of ALS per year, per 100,000 people in the United States and Europe combined, resulting in approximately 5,000 newly diagnosed patients in the United States each year. While the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, approximately 10% of cases are found to be familial in nature. The C9orf72 gene mutation is currently the most common demonstrated mutation related to ALS and is present in approximately 40% of familial ALS and 8-10% of sporadic ALS patients. 
 ALS Current Treatments
 There is significant unmet need for the treatment of ALS. Two drugs are currently approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS. Rilutek® (riluzole), an inhibitor of glutamate release, was approved in 1995 for the treatment of patients with ALS. It was demonstrated to extend survival by three to six months. Radicava® (edaravone) was approved in 2017 for the treatment of ALS. Administration of edaravone resulted in a significantly smaller decline in the ALS Functional Ration Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) through six months of treatment.
 25

FTD Background and Market Opportunity
 FTD is a neurodegenerative disorder of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain. It is characterized by changes in personality, cognition (e.g., language impairment and executive dysfunction), and behavior (e.g., disinhibition, apathy and compulsivity). Diagnostic criteria categorize FTD into either the behavioral variant (approximately 60% of patients) or speech/language variant (approximately 40% of patients) based on the primary symptom observed at presentation; however, FTD results in dementia in all patients. The majority of FTD associated with the G4C2 expansion in the C9ORF72 gene is categorized as the behavioral variant. FTD frequently has an onset in mid-life, and death typically occurs within three to 14 years of onset. FTD is the second most common form of early-onset dementia in people under the age of 65, after AD.
 In FTD, the C9ORF72 gene mutations appear in 38% of familial cases and 6% of sporadic cases. FTD affects approximately 55,000 people in the United States.
 FTD Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for the treatment of FTD. Treatment to date has involved use of medications for symptomatic management.
 Our Program
 WVE-3972-01 is an investigational oligonucleotide that was designed to preferentially knockdown G4C2 repeat-containing C9ORF72 mRNA transcripts, which are associated with ALS and FTD. Expansion of the G4C2 repeat alters the normal expression of the C9ORF72 gene and causes the production of repeat-containing RNAs. These RNAs accumulate in cellular nuclei in the form of RNA foci and can be translated into dipeptide repeat (“DPR”) proteins. Neuronal degeneration associated with the expression of the repeat expansion is hypothesized to arise either from a toxic loss-of-function mechanism due to a reduction in C9orf72 protein or a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism through the accumulation of RNA foci and/or DPRs in the brain and spinal cord. 
 By targeting the mRNA transcripts that contain the G4C2 expansion found in the C9orf72 gene, WVE‑3972‑01 has the potential to reduce both RNA-based and protein-based toxicity, thereby impacting the disease course and slowing the progression of ALS or FTD. As WVE-3972-01 preferentially targets the transcripts containing the G4C2 expansion, it is designed to minimize the impact on normal C9orf72 protein levels in patients, thereby reducing potential on-target risk. 
 Our data suggest that preferential targeting of repeat-containing transcripts using WVE-3972-01 may be a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of ALS and FTD associated with C9ORF72-repeat expansions. We expect to initiate clinical trials of WVE-3972-01 in ALS and FTD in Q4 2018.
 26

WVE-3972-01 preferentially reduces G4C2-repeat containing transcript levels in several in vitro models. For example, as shown below, administration of WVE-3972-01 to C9ORF72-ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons under gymnotic conditions showed preferential knock down of C9orf72 repeat-containing transcripts relative to total transcripts. A clear dose-dependent decrease in repeat-containing transcripts was observed, with a calculated IC50 of 0.4 μM. In contrast, total transcripts were only slightly reduced and only at the highest doses tested, with a maximal reduction of 42% at 10 μM. Notably, approximately 20% of the reduction in C9ORF72 total transcripts can be attributed to the reduction in the repeat-containing transcripts.
 
Importantly, WVE-3972-01 led to preferential knockdown of repeat-containing C9ORF72 transcripts in a mouse model. In the transgenic model, mice express the human C9ORF72 gene from a bacterial artificial chromosome (“BAC”). In these mice, WVE-3972-01 engaged C9ORF72 across cell types in regions of the CNS critically implicated in ALS. The figure below shows that our stereopure oligonucleotides (stereopure) led to preferential reduction of repeat-containing C9ORF72 transcripts (right panel) in the spinal cord compared with all transcripts (left panel) in C9ORF72 transgenic mice. The stereorandom oligonucleotide (random) was neither selective for the repeat-containing transcripts nor as potent as the stereopure oligonucleotides against repeat-containing transcripts.

In addition, in in vivo animal models, WVE-3972-01 produced substantial reductions in DPR proteins and RNA foci, which remained low through eight weeks, the last observed time point (shown in the figures below). DPR proteins were reduced 76% and 87% in the spinal cord and the cortex, respectively. RNA foci were reduced by 70% in the spinal cord. These data have been replicated in blinded preclinical studies in an independent laboratory through our collaboration with Dr. Robert H. Brown, Jr., the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (“UMMS”), Worcester, MA.

Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
 Background and Market Opportunity
 SCA3 is a rare, hereditary (autosomal dominant) progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower extremities. Signs and symptoms of SCA3 may begin between childhood and late adulthood, and they vary greatly. Symptoms may include progressive clumsiness in the arms and legs, spasticity, difficulty with gait, and impaired speaking, swallowing and eye movements. Symptoms of the disease worsen over time, eventually leading to paralysis. Some patients with SCA3 develop dystonia or symptoms similar to those of PD, including twitching of the face or tongue, and nerve damage (neuropathy). Life expectancy ranges from the mid-30s (more severe forms) to a nearly normal life expectancy for those with milder forms of the disease. 
 SCA3 is caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine stretch in the encoded ataxin-3 protein. Mutant ataxin-3 protein is thought to cause widespread neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord, likely through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism. SCA3 is the most common dominantly inherited form of ataxia. The prevalence of SCA3 is believed to be one to two cases in 100,000 people with significant geographic and ethnic variations.
 Current Treatments
 There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved for treatment of SCA3. Treatment to date has involved the use of medications for symptomatic management.
 Our Program
 We have initiated research to identify potential candidates targeting ATXN3 for the treatment of SCA3. Early research suggests there are multiple target sites for oligonucleotides that allow us to knock down the ATXN3 gene in allele-specific or non-discriminatory ways. Further studies are in progress to assess the efficacy and benefits of each of these approaches. We expect to have a candidate identified by the end of 2018. 
Emerging Franchises
 We believe that our platform will drive the discovery and advancement of stereopure therapeutic candidates in our initial focus area of neurology and additional therapeutic areas. We continue to explore ways that our multi-modality chemistry may be optimized to address a multitude of rare genetic diseases. Based on our design principles, we have demonstrated our ability to rapidly design and select lead therapeutic candidates with optimized pharmacological properties in preclinical studies. Outside of neurology, we have early-stage discovery programs focused on screening activities and lead optimization for potential drug candidates in ophthalmologic and hepatic diseases. We intend to continue to advance these discovery programs and explore opportunities to expand to other areas independently and through collaborations and partnerships.

Ophthalmology
 
We are advancing the development of stereopure compounds to target genetic ophthalmologic diseases, with initial emphasis on retinal diseases. Our discovery research has tested the hypothesis that controlling the chirality of PS linkages in the backbones of oligonucleotides will provide a benefit in potency, distribution and duration of effect in the eye. In these studies, we have employed MALAT1 as a surrogate target. We generated stereopure compounds targeting the long non-coding MALAT1 RNA and evaluated them in vitro in iCell neurons under gymnotic conditions. We then evaluated lead stereopure oligonucleotides in vivo following single intravitreal injection (5 µg and 50 µg) in the mouse eye. We are assessing reduction of MALAT1 RNA by qPCR, levels and distribution of oligonucleotides by hybridization ELISA and IHC, and duration of effect over a six-month period. 
 
We successfully delivered stereopure MALAT1 oligonucleotides under gymnotic conditions to iCell neurons with our best-performing compounds exhibiting IC50 values approximately 24-fold lower than those of stereorandom oligonucleotides. In the back of the eye (shown in the figure above), the stereorandom oligonucleotide (SR+, 50 µg) produced a 75% knockdown of MALAT1 mRNA, which was maintained for two weeks. At one month, this fell to a 50% reduction, and at three months, a 53% reduction. At the same dose (Stereopure, 50 µg), the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved an 85% reduction in MALAT1 mRNA as early as seven days post-single intravitreal injection, which was maintained at one month. At three months post-dose, a 62% reduction persisted. At a 10-fold lower dose (5 µg), the stereopure oligonucleotide still exhibited greater knockdown of MALAT1 RNA through one month (70 % vs. 50% knockdown) and three months (62% vs. 53%) than the stereorandom oligonucleotide. In summary, a 10-fold enhancement in potency was achieved in vivo with a stereopure oligonucleotide compared with a stereorandom oligonucleotide, and this effect was sustained through three months.
 
Similar results were observed in the front of the eye (figure below). 
 
30

In a preliminary in vivo experiment in NHPs, the stereopure oligonucleotide achieved a clear dose-dependent knockdown of MALAT1 mRNA in three separate eye tissues (retina/choroid/sclera, iris and cornea) one week following a single intravitreal injection (figure below). 
 
These studies support the hypothesis that stereopure compounds can be designed to increase the potency, distribution and duration of effect in the eye compared with stereorandom oligonucleotides. Additional research is being conducted to develop stereopure oligonucleotides against specific genetic targets to treat diseases of the eye, including retinal diseases.
 Hepatic
 Our collaboration with Pfizer continues to make progress toward developing genetically targeted therapies for the treatment of metabolic liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The collaboration has accelerated the application of our stereochemistry platform across antisense and RNAi modalities with the incorporation of GalNAc and Pfizer’s hepatic-targeting technology to address metabolic diseases of the liver. As part of the collaboration, three targets have been declared, including APOC3. Our stereopure GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide demonstrated a potency equivalent to state-of-the-art GalNAc-conjugated double-strand RNAi with a median effective dose of 0.3mg/kg in vivo. In addition, our stereopure GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotide demonstrated a 7- to 10-fold improvement in potency and an increase in durability in vivo compared with stereorandom GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotides. In November 2017, we achieved a milestone under our collaboration with Pfizer by demonstrating significant activity of stereopure GalNAc-conjugated APOC3 antisense oligonucleotides over stereorandom oligonucleotides in in vivo studies and meeting other milestone criteria.

Licensing Arrangements and Research Collaborations 
 Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize a broad pipeline of nucleic acid therapies. As part of this strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into new partnership and collaboration agreements as a means of advancing our own nucleic acid therapeutic programs, investing in third-party technologies to further strengthen our drug development platform and leveraging external partnerships to extend the reach of our drug development platform in therapeutic areas where our chemistry platform demonstrates a competitive advantage. 
Our Partnerships 
 Takeda
 In February 2018, Wave Life Sciences USA, Inc. and Wave Life Sciences UK Limited (collectively as used in this description, “we”), two of our direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”) with Takeda. Subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Takeda Collaboration Agreement is expected to become effective during Q1 2018.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we and Takeda have agreed to collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics for disorders of the CNS. The collaboration provides Takeda with the option to globally co-develop and commercialize programs targeting HD, ALS, FTD and SCA3, (collectively, the “Category 1 Programs”), which we will have the right to co-commercialize in the United States. In addition, Takeda will have the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs for CNS disorders, including AD and PD (collectively, the “Category 2 Programs”). 
 With respect to Category 1 Programs, we will be responsible for researching and developing products and companion diagnostics for Category 1 Programs through completion of the first proof of mechanism study for such products. Takeda will have an exclusive option for each target and all associated products and companion diagnostics for such target, which it may exercise at any time through completion of the proof of mechanism study. If Takeda exercises this option, we will receive an opt-in payment and will lead manufacturing and joint clinical co-development activities; Takeda will lead joint co-commercial activities in the United States and all commercial activities outside of the United States. Global costs and potential profits will be shared 50:50 and we will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestone payments. In addition to its 50% profit share, we are eligible to receive option exercise fees and development and commercial milestone payments for each of the Category 1 Programs. 
 With respect to Category 2 Programs, we have granted Takeda the right to exclusively license multiple preclinical programs during a four-year research term (subject to limited extension for programs that were initiated prior to the expiration of the research term, in accordance with the Takeda Collaboration Agreement). During that term, the parties may collaborate on preclinical programs for up to six targets at any one time. We will be responsible for researching and preclinically developing products and companion diagnostics directed to the agreed upon targets through completion of IND-enabling studies in the first major market country. Thereafter, Takeda will have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize products and companion diagnostics directed to such targets, subject to our retained rights to lead manufacturing activities for products directed to such targets. Takeda will fund our research and preclinical activities in the amount of $60 million during the research term and will reimburse us for any collaboration-budgeted research and preclinical expenses incurred by us that exceed that amount. We are also eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to mid-teen royalties on Takeda’s global commercial sales of products from each Category 2 Program. 
 In addition to the research support funding of $60 million over four years and the profit and loss sharing and royalty payments described above, Takeda will make an upfront payment of $110 million and an upfront equity investment of $60 million when the Takeda Collaboration Agreement takes effect. 
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, each party grants to the other party specific intellectual property licenses to enable the other party to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, including license grants to enable each party to conduct research, development and commercialization activities pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. 
 The term of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement runs from the date on which the closing has occurred under the share purchase agreement for the Takeda Equity Investment (as described below), which is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and, unless terminated earlier, will continue until the date on which: (i) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda does not exercise its option, expiration or termination of the development program with respect to such target; (ii) with respect to each Category 1 Program target for which Takeda exercises its option, the date on which neither party is researching, developing or manufacturing any products or companion diagnostics directed to such target; or (iii) with respect to each Category 2 Program target, the date on which royalties are no longer payable with respect to products directed to such target. 
 32

Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for convenience on 180 days’ notice, in its entirety or on target-by-target basis. Subject to certain exceptions, each party has the right to terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement on a target-by-target basis if the other party or, a third party related to such party, challenges the patentability, enforceability or validity of any patents within the licensed technology that cover any product or companion diagnostic that is subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In the event of any material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement by a party, subject to cure rights, the other party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the breach relates to all targets or on a target-by-target basis if the breach relates to a specific target. In the event that Takeda and its affiliates cease development, manufacturing and commercialization activities with respect to compounds or products subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and directed to a particular target, we may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to such target. Either party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s insolvency. In certain termination circumstances, we would receive a license from Takeda to continue researching, developing and manufacturing certain products, and companion diagnostics.
 Simultaneously with our entry into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a share purchase agreement with Takeda pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Takeda 1,096,892 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $54.70 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $60.0 million (the “Takeda Equity Investment”). Subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the Takeda Equity Investment is expected to close during Q1 2018. The shares being purchased by Takeda are subject to lock-up and standstill restrictions and carry certain registration rights, customary for transactions of this kind.
 Pfizer
 In May 2016, we entered into a research, license and option agreement with Pfizer Inc. (the “Pfizer Collaboration Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, we and Pfizer agreed to collaborate on the discovery, development and commercialization of stereopure oligonucleotide therapeutics for up to five programs (the “Pfizer Programs”), each directed at a genetically-defined hepatic target selected by Pfizer (the “Pfizer Collaboration”). Under the terms of the agreements we entered into with Pfizer and its affiliate, Pfizer paid us $40.0 million upfront, $30.0 million of which took the form of an equity investment in our ordinary shares, as described below. Subject to option exercises by Pfizer, we may earn potential research, development and commercial milestone payments, plus royalties, tiered up to low double-digits, on sales of any products that may result from the Pfizer Collaboration. 
 
Under the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement, the parties agreed to collaborate during the four-year research term. During the research term, we are responsible to use our commercially reasonable efforts to advance up to five programs through to the selection of clinical candidates. At that stage, Pfizer may elect to license any of these programs exclusively and to have exclusive rights to undertake the clinical development of the clinical candidates into products and the potential commercialization of any such products thereafter. In addition, under the Pfizer Collaboration, we receive a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicensable license to use Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology in any of our own hepatic programs that are outside the scope of the collaboration (the “Wave Programs”). If we use Pfizer’s technology on our programs, Pfizer is eligible to receive potential development and commercial milestone payments from us. Pfizer is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of any products that include Pfizer’s hepatic targeting technology.
 As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Pfizer had declared three hepatic targets, including APOC3 and two undisclosed programs and has until May 2018 to declare up to two additional hepatic targets. Also in connection with the Pfizer Collaboration, Pfizer agreed that it will be subject to certain standstill restrictions customary for transactions of this kind. The term of the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement runs from the effective date until the date of the last to expire payment obligations with respect to each Pfizer Program and with respect to each Wave Program, and expires on a program-by-program basis accordingly. 
 
Simultaneously with the entry into the Pfizer Collaboration Agreement with Pfizer, we entered into a share purchase agreement with C.P. Pharmaceuticals International C.V., an affiliate of Pfizer (the “Pfizer affiliate”). Pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement, the Pfizer affiliate purchased 1,875,000 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $16.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $30.0 million. The shares purchased by the Pfizer affiliate are subject to lock-up restrictions and carry certain registration rights outlined in the share purchase agreement. 
 Our Technology Licenses 
 Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH 
 In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Max-Planck-Innovation GmbH (“MI”), pursuant to which we obtained a co-exclusive royalty-bearing, worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products in all fields of use under certain patent rights owned by Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (“MPG”), and patent rights owned by UMMS, which has been granted to us by MI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPG, acting as MPG’s technology transfer agency and UMMS’s 
 33

authorized licensing agency for such patents. MPG and MI are collectively referred to herein as Max-Planck. Our license is one of two maximum allowable co-exclusive licenses for these patents, the other of which is currently held by Ionis. 
 Our patent rights under this license are to patent filings that relate to certain sequence and structural features of single-stranded RNA molecules that mediate target-specific RNA interference, and include both filings that are owned by Max-Planck and arose from research conducted by Thomas Tuschl, Ph.D. and his colleagues at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and also an issued U.S. patent owned by the University of Massachusetts (“UMASS”), that prevailed in an interference with one of the Max-Planck filings and was subsequently included, through a separate agreement between Max-Planck and UMASS, within the portfolio that Max-Planck is authorized to license. The Max-Planck licensed patent portfolio includes issued U.S. and Canadian patents, and pending U.S. and European patent applications, each of which has a projected 20-year term that extends into 2023. 
 We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice and payment of all accrued amounts owing to Max-Planck. Max-Planck may terminate the agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we challenge the validity of its patents, upon 30 days’ prior written notice if we undergo a change of control and cannot demonstrate that we will maintain a development and commercialization program that is substantially similar or greater in scope than the program prior to the change of control event, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach (or 45 days in the case of nonpayment). Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the later of the expiration or abandonment of all issued patents and filed patent applications with the patent rights covered by the agreement or April 28, 2019. 
 Our Research Collaborations 
 University of Oxford; Professor Matthew Wood’s Laboratory 
 Since April 2015, we have been collaborating with Dr. Matthew J.A. Wood, Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Oxford and Co-Director of the Oxford Centre for Neuromuscular Science under a translational research collaboration agreement with The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford (“Oxford”). Dr. Wood’s research is in the field of degenerative disorders of the nervous system and muscle. His laboratory’s main focus is the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches using short nucleic acids to target mRNA. His team has been investigating the potential of single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides for the modification of mRNA splicing, for example in DMD. In October 2016 we extended our research collaboration for an additional 27 months in order for Oxford to characterize our proprietary isomers in murine models to further improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides using our novel chemistries and to discover biomarkers associated with disease progression and pharmacological activity for the treatment of DMD. Under this collaboration, we are exploring additional exon targets, including exon 45 and exon 44 beyond our lead DMD programs, which target exon 51 and exon 53. In October 2017, we expanded our research collaboration with Oxford beyond DMD to include spinal muscular atrophy, with a term of 18 months. 
University of Dundee 
 Since September 2015, we have been conducting research in collaboration with the University of Dundee (“Dundee”) that involves characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of keratin disorders. We and Dundee have received a five-year grant to support a collaborative research project entitled ‘Delivering gene silencing therapy to the epidermic and ocular surface,’ effective March 1, 2017. 
University of Massachusetts Medical School
 Since January 2017, we have been conducting research in collaboration with Dr. Robert H. Brown, Jr., the Leo P. and Theresa M. LaChance Chair in Medical Research and Chair of the Department of Neurology at UMMS, an internationally known researcher and physician in the field. Our research collaboration with UMMS is focused on characterizing our proprietary isomers in order to improve the pharmacology of oligonucleotides for the treatment of ALS and FTD, and investigating the mechanisms of action of specific and efficient knockdown of the targeted mutant C9ORF72 mRNA. 
 ReadCoor
 Since April 2017, we have been collaborating with ReadCoor, Inc. (“ReadCoor”) to develop a registry of brain cell network maps and advance our chemistry for targeted drug delivery to the brain. ReadCoor is a company focused on leading the next generation of ‘omics by delivering the first panomic spatial sequencing platform to researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies. The collaboration leverages ReadCoor’s proprietary FISSEQ (Florescent In-Situ Sequencing) platform designed to provide critical spatial data by combining next generation sequencing and three-dimensional imaging. 
 34

Manufacturing 
 To provide internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities and increase control and visibility of our drug product supply chain, we entered into a lease in September 2016 for a multi-use facility of approximately 90,000 square feet in Lexington, Massachusetts and immediately initiated the build out of manufacturing space and related capabilities. In addition to manufacturing space, the Lexington facility includes additional laboratory and office space to support our growth. This facility supplements our existing Cambridge, Massachusetts laboratory and office space headquarters, enhances our ability to secure drug product for current and future development activities and may provide commercial-scale manufacturing capabilities. In July 2017, we took occupancy of the Lexington facility and began manufacturing production in Q4 2017.
 We believe that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity through our third-party contract manufacturers and our internal manufacturing facility to meet our current research, clinical and early-stage commercial needs. We believe that the addition of our internal cGMP manufacturing capabilities, together with the supply capacity we have established externally will be sufficient to meet our anticipated manufacturing needs for the next several years. We monitor the availability of capacity for the manufacture of drug substance and drug product and believe that our supply agreements with our contract manufacturers and the lead times for new supply agreements would allow us to access additional capacity if needed. We believe that our products can be manufactured at scale and with production and procurement efficiencies that will result in commercially competitive costs. 
 Research and Development 
 Since commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development activities, including the development of our core platform technology and our therapeutic programs. We incurred research and development expenses of $79.3 million, $40.8 million and $9.1 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our therapeutic programs. 
 
Intellectual Property
 We own or have rights to worldwide patent filings that protect our proprietary technologies for making stereopure oligonucleotide compositions, and that also protect the compositions themselves, as well as methods of using them, including in the treatment of diseases. As of March 1, 2018, our portfolio includes at least 12 issued U.S. patents, at least 37 issued foreign patents, and pending applications in at least 37 jurisdictions. The information contained in this “Business – Intellectual Property” subsection is current as of March 1, 2018.
 
Synthetic Methodologies 
 
Our patent portfolio includes multiple families that protect synthetic methodologies and/or key reagents for generating stereopure oligonucleotide compositions. Certain synthetic methodologies and/or key reagents are covered by families originally filed by the University of Tokyo. We have obtained exclusive rights to these families, which include two issued Japanese patents that have terms that extend to 2022-2025. 
 
Additional synthetic methodologies and/or reagents are protected by families that we own. Certain families have 20-year expiration dates that range from 2029 to 2037. Some of these families have issued patents in several jurisdictions, including in major relevant jurisdictions such as the United States, Europe, and/or Japan; all have pending applications either at the international stage or in multiple jurisdictions. 
 We also co-own with the University of Tokyo certain filings that are directed to certain methods and/or reagents for synthesizing oligonucleotides; their 20-year expiration dates fall in 2031. 
 Stereopure Oligonucleotide Compositions
 Certain of our patent filings protect stereopure compositions, particularly of therapeutically relevant oligonucleotides. Some such filings are directed to compositions whose oligonucleotides are characterized by particular patterns of chemical modification (including modifications of bases, sugars and/or internucleotidic linkages) and/or of internucleotidic linkage stereochemistry. Certain patent filings describe specific compositions designed for use in the treatment of particular diseases (e.g., HD, DMD). Several of our patent filings directed to stereopure compositions have entered national stage prosecution in multiple jurisdictions; others are in the international stage. Certain filings offer 20-year protection terms that extend into 2033-2037. 
 
35

We also co-own with Shin Nippon Biomedical Laboratories, Ltd. various patent families that relate to stereopure oligonucleotide adjuvant compositions and have entered national stage prosecution in multiple jurisdictions; these have 20-year terms extending to 2033-2035. 
 Future Filings 
 We maintain a thoughtful and ambitious program for developing and protecting additional intellectual property, including new synthetic methodologies and reagents. We also intend to prepare and submit patent filings specifically directed to protecting individual product candidates and their uses as we finalize leads and collect relevant data, which is expected to include comparison data confirming novel and/or beneficial attributes of our product candidates. 
Singapore Intellectual Property Law 
 
Section 34 of the Singapore Patents Act provides that a person residing in Singapore is required to obtain written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents before filing an application for a patent for an invention outside of Singapore, unless all of the following conditions have been satisfied: (a) the person has filed an application for a patent for the same invention in the Singapore Registry of Patents at least two months before the filing of the patent application outside Singapore, and (b) the Singapore Registrar of Patents has not, in respect of this patent application, given directions to prohibit or restrict the publication of information contained in the patent application or its communication to any persons or description of persons pursuant to Section 33 of the Singapore Patents Act, or if the Singapore Registrar of Patents has given any such directions, all such directions have been revoked. A violation of Section 34 is a criminal offense punishable by a fine not exceeding S$5,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. There have been some instances where we have undertaken filings outside of Singapore, and there may be instances where we undertake such filings in the future, without first obtaining written authorization from the Singapore Registrar of Patents. When this has happened in the past, we have notified the Registrar and the Registrar has offered a compound of the offences against payment of a sum of S$50 in each of these cases. Under Singapore law, the Registrar has discretion to offer a compound of such offences against payment of a sum of money of up to S$2,000. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical marketplace is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our expertise in nucleic acid therapeutics, scientific knowledge and intellectual property estate provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on nucleic acid therapeutics, but any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 Huntington’s Disease 
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of HD. We believe, based on publicly available information, that Roche and Ionis (Phase 2) have an investigational drug in clinical development and several companies have ongoing preclinical programs in HD, including Sangamo Biosciences, ProQR, Nuredis, uniQure, Spark Therapeutics and Voyager Therapeutics. 
 A number of companies are developing drugs to treat symptoms associated with HD, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Phase 2), Vaccinex (Phase 2), Prana Biotechnology (Phase 2), Omeros Corporation (Phase 2), Stealth BioTherapeutics (Phase 2) and Azevan Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), among others.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
 Sarepta Therapeutics’ eteplirsen, an exon skipping nucleic acid therapeutic, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD in the United States in September 2016. The FDA concluded that the data submitted demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in some patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. No clinical benefit of eteplirsen has been established. Thus, in accordance with the U.S. accelerated approval regulations, the FDA is requiring Sarepta to conduct a clinical trial to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study is designed to assess whether eteplirsen improves motor function of DMD patients with a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene amenable to exon 51 skipping. If the trial fails to verify clinical benefit, the FDA could initiate proceedings to withdraw approval of the drug. Sarepta has submitted a market authorization application in the European Union and anticipates a decision from the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. 
 For PTC Therapeutics, conditional market authorization has been granted in Europe for ataluren for the treatment of nonsense mutation DMD for ambulatory patients who are five years of age or older. In October 2017, PTC Therapeutics received a CRL from the FDA declining to approve their NDA for ataluren. PTC Therapeutics filed a formal dispute resolution request with the FDA appealing this decision. In February 2018, the FDA reiterated their prior position and denied PTC Therapeutics’ appeal and recommended a possible path forward for ataluren based on the accelerated approval pathway. In addition, BioMarin Pharmaceutical’s drisapersen is an exon-skipping nucleic acid therapeutic candidate for DMD for which the FDA issued a CRL in January 2016 indicating that the review cycle was complete and that the NDA was not ready for approval in its present form. 
 We believe, based on publicly available information, that a number of other companies are developing drugs that may alter the progression of the disease. Those with programs in clinical development include Roche (Phase 3), Catabasis Pharmaceuticals (Phase 3), Intalfarmaco (Phase 3), Pfizer (Phase 2 and Phase 1), Summit Therapeutics (Phase 2), FibroGen (Phase 2), Capricor Therapeutics (Phase 2), Sarepta Therapeutics (Phase 3 and Phase 1) and Solid Biosciences (Phase 1).
 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia
 There are two treatments approved in the United States for the treatment of ALS, riluzole, approved in 1995, and edaravone, approved in 2017. There are a number of companies with potential therapeutics for the treatment of ALS in clinical development, including AB Sciences (Phase 3), Cytokinetics (Phase 2), Orphazyme (Phase 2), BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics (Phase 2), Genentech (Phase 1) and Biogen and Ionis (Phase 1). Currently, there are no investigational therapies in clinical development specifically targeting C9ORF72.
 There are no approved treatments available to slow the progression of FTD. Few companies have investigational therapies in clinical development specifically for FTD. Ionis (Phase 1) and AlzProtect (Phase 1) appear to be including FTD in their broader AD or tauopathies clinical development plans.

Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 
 FDA approval is required before any new drug, such as a new molecular or chemical entity, or a new dosage form, new use or new route of administration of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with applicable FDA good laboratory practice regulations and other requirements (“GLPs”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------

 The manufacturing development, preclinical and clinical testing, and review process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Manufacturing development includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, development of manufacturing and control procedures, evaluation of stability, and the establishment of procedures to ensure continued product quality.
 Preclinical tests include animal studies to assess the toxicity and other safety characteristics of the product candidate, as well as other important aspects of drug pharmacology. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Preclinical testing will often continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve all outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, or if changes are made in trial design. Even if the IND becomes effective and the trial proceeds without initial FDA objection, the FDA may stop the trial at a later time if it has concerns, such as if unacceptable safety risks arise. 
 38

Further, an independent IRB at each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must perform an ongoing review of the research on an annual basis until the trial is completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trials are not being conducted in accordance with GCPs, and an IRB may also suspend a clinical trial at its site for similar reasons. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website clinicaltrials.gov, key parameters of a clinical trial. For purposes of an NDA submission, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The product is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety, generally at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product and to provide adequate information for approval of the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. 
 For some products, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), which could include measures imposed by the FDA such as programs to communicate risk outside of labeling, prescribing restrictions, or certain restrictions on distribution and use. 
 Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. Any resubmitted application is also subject to 60-day review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the PDUFA, first the FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review for an NDA for a new molecular entity (“NME”) has a goal of being completed within a ten-month timeframe from FDA filing of the application. A Priority Review designation is given to products intended for serious conditions that provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, such as providing a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The goal for completing a Priority Review for an NME NDA is six months from filing. 
 The review process may be extended by the FDA by three months from the goal date to consider certain information or obtain clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the clinical sites where pivotal trials were conducted and the contract research organization facilities with oversight of the trial, in order to ensure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the study data.
 39


After the FDA evaluates the NDA it may issue an approval letter or a CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 The FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk- management mechanisms, such as a Boxed Warning, which highlights a serious safety concern that should be mitigated under a REMS program. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, a company is generally required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA, which may require the company to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 
Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, generally those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, or that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within six months from the time of filing as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm that the drug confers a clinical benefit for the patient. 
 Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), one of the expedited programs added is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all Fast Track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1 and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to safety surveillance and adverse event reporting, periodic reporting, continued cGMP compliance and quality oversight, compliance with post-marketing commitments, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, and reporting manufacturing and labeling changes, as applicable. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for assessment of compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction, and sometimes notification of, any deviations from cGMP. These regulations impose reporting and documentation requirements on the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 40

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unlisted severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as noncompliance with cGMP or failure to correct previously identified inspection findings, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | issuance of field alerts, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, product recalls, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials using the product or other products manufactured at the same facility;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions, consent decrees, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. While physicians may generally prescribe a drug for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the drug in accordance with the data provided in the approved product label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have promoted false and misleading information about the product may be subject to significant liability, both at the federal and state levels. 
 The FDA has authority to require a REMS from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA may consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a NME. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval, or at a later date should significant new risk information come to light. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use that the FDA deems necessary to assure the benefits of use of the drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to assess the strategy, often at 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years after the strategy’s approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as one affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals where there is no reasonable expectation that the product development cost will be recovered from product sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the drug and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If an orphan drug-designated product subsequently receives FDA approval for the disease for which it was designed, the product will be entitled to seven years of product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, or if our product candidate is determined to be the same drug as a competitor’s product for the same indication or disease, the competitor’s exclusivity could block the approval of our product candidate in the designated orphan indication for seven years, unless our product is demonstrated to be clinically superior to the competitor’s drug. 
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”) provides NDA holders a six-month period of exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with FDA—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA, of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications.
 
41

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 In Vitro Diagnostic Tests for Biomarkers
 
For some of our product candidates, we plan to work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to in vitro companion diagnostic tests to identify appropriate patients for these targeted therapies. If a sponsor or the FDA believes that a diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product, a sponsor will typically work with a collaborator to develop an in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”). IVDs are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and it issued final and draft guidance documents that are intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. 
 
The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. If a company is required to perform clinical trials for the IVD diagnostic, and the IVD is viewed as a significant risk device, the sponsor will have to submit an investigational device exemption application, or IDE. If the diagnostic test and the therapeutic drug are studied together to support their respective approvals, the clinical trial must meet both the IDE and IND requirements. 
 The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an IVD companion diagnostic device in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device will be developed contemporaneously. If the companion diagnostic test will be used to make critical treatment decisions such as patient selection, treatment assignment, or treatment arm, it will likely be considered a significant risk device for which a clinical trial will be required. After approval, the use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product will be stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product. In addition, a diagnostic test that was approved through the PMA process or one that was cleared through the 510(k) process and placed on the market will be subject to many of the same regulatory requirements that apply to approved drugs.
 42

Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other countries in which we conduct our business after a product is approved and commercialized. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Healthcare Reform 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Both Congress and President Trump have expressed their intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA has or any potential changes to the ACA could have on our business. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for any of our product candidates, if approved. These and other potential legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. The ACA, as well as other federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenues. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Limited third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
Manufacturing Requirements 
 We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP requirements. The cGMP requirements include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture commercial products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, voluntary corrective action, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, disgorgement of profits, and other civil and criminal penalties. 
 43

Other Regulatory Requirements 
 We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and generate revenues. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
