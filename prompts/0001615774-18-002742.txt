Organizational History
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary LifeApps, Inc., we are a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple Apps Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. We are also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. We have distributed apps on all three platforms. Moving forward we are developing a digital media network specializing in targeting highly sought-after niche demographic audiences. We will focus on two core businesses, an LGBT Ad Network and an LGBT Digital Network. Through our digital platform we will aggregate content from around the world. We will create original content along with sponsored content in a 24/7 digital network. The LGBT Ad Network will assist brands in global targeting of the LGBT demographic. The Ad Network will provide advertisers and brands with over 300 mainstream digital platforms and a "bullseye" on this loyal, affluent and ever-expanding audience. We will deliver to our audience with a relevant sponsored content marketing message across all spectrums of digitally connected devices. Our unique value proposition to our audience and sponsors is the ability deliver aggregated and original content, with emphasis on interactive content and captive video.
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware as Prime Time Travel, Inc. on November 23, 2010, for the purpose of creating and managing trips to destination locations for youth basketball teams. On August 23, 2012, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to, among other things, change our name from Prime Time Travel, Inc. to LifeApps Digital Media Inc., and increase our authorized capitalization to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.
 
On September 5, 2012, we effected a 15-for-1 forward stock split in the form of a dividend to holders of our common stock as of record on September 4, 2012.
 
On September 20, 2012, LifeApps Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary of ours, merged with and into LifeApps Inc., which had been organized as a California limited liability company on July 13, 2009, and was converted to a Nevada corporation on September 7, 2012 in anticipation of the merger.  In connection with the merger, each share of LifeApps common stock was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 400 shares of our common stock. LifeApps was the surviving corporation of that Merger. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of LifeApps, and are continuing the existing business operations of LifeApps as our primary business operations.
 
Immediately following the merger, we split off our wholly owned subsidiary, Prime Time Split Corp., a Delaware corporation, through the exchange of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Split Corp.  All of our assets and liabilities immediately following the merger, excluding any assets and liabilities assumed in the merger, were transferred to Split Corp.
 
On December 31, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to (i) change our corporate name to LifeApps Brands Inc., (ii) effect a one-for-fifteen (1:15) reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and (iii) increase our authorized capitalization from 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Reverse Split and Name Change took effect on OTC Markets at the commencement of business on January 7, 2016, at which time our common stock began trading on a post-reverse split basis.
 
Our fiscal year end is December 31.

Business Overview 
 
LifeApps® is a licensed developer and publisher of apps for the Apple App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and iPad mini. LifeApps® is also a licensed developer on both Google Play and Amazon Appstore for Android. LifeApps® has distributed apps/publications on all three platforms. Moving forward LifeApps will focus on the development of niche demographic media networks. The management team has selected the LGBT marketplace as their first audience to target for the following reasons: The LGBT community has four times the buying power of Hispanics and African Americans, two times the buying power of Asian Americans and four times the buying power of millennials, and they are extremely loyal and consistent consumers. ​At current growth rates purchasing power of the LGBT community is expected to exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2020. (Accenture) Currently the LGBT audience is fragmented across multiple sites. We will target this audience directly with community specific content, blogs, stories and video. Currently there are 19.6 million people who identify themselves as LGBT in the US. They represent 890 billion dollars of buying power in the US and 3 trillion dollars globally. (Witeck/Selig Center) Same-sex households have 23% higher median income as compared to mainstream households. (Prudential) They are 1.23 times more likely to buy brands that reflect their style and they are 1.56 times more likely to consider themselves a spender rather than a saver. (comScore) Our focus will be to aggregate the LGBT audience through a powerful database marketing platform. 
 
LifeApps® is also expanding its revenue generating potential through the creation of new gateway digital platforms that combine e-commerce with mobile-commerce solutions to act as conduits or meeting places for users to engage in the commerce. These gateway platforms can also be utilized and distributed across the broader base of the LifeApps® suite of products.
 
LifeApps® will continue to explore acquisitions of companies and new technologies. In addition, the company will also explore the acquisition of consumer related products as well. Such acquisitions will be considered where the purchase can help increase our revenues or enable the Company to attain assets that will allow us to gain technological advances that would be more costly to develop than to purchase.
 
LifeApps® will continue a flexible approach as opportunities arise from the emergence of these rapidly evolving mobile hardware and software markets. LifeApps® will focus resources where they will be the most effective at growing the business and driving revenues. LifeApps® ability for internal development and external purchase of new technologies and companies will depend upon its ability to raise future financing.
 
Our Products
 
LifeApps Media Network Platform
 
LifeApps will focus on two major revenue platform initiatives both currently in late stage product development. Our first priority will be to launch a global website platform that will aggregate original and outsourced content with an emphasis on interactive content and captive video.
 
Our second initiative will be to license technology and software in order to launch the LGBT Ad Network. The Network will provide advertising sponsors and brands with over 300 mainstream digital platforms to get their message out and hit the “bullseye” on this loyal, affluent and ever-expanding audience. We will utilize a powerful and relevant sponsored-content marketing message across all spectrums of digitally connected devices.
 
The combined platforms are expected to provide our audience and advertising sponsors with a highly targeted map to navigate the enormous and growing LGBT community. Our 360-degree approach includes data to pinpoint advertising and marketing campaigns designed to connect and create strategic partnerships. Our prior experience ensures educated decision-making and confidence in planning, approach, and execution of campaigns and partnerships that provide quantifiable results. The marketing content strategy campaigns are based on our expertise and insight of what drives LGBT consumer engagement disseminating relevant content to each of the vertical demographics.
 
Revenue 
 
LifeApps® intends to monetize and drive revenue through development of niche media networks. We will target LGBT consumers on mainstream websites with native content through our direct access to over 300 global leading cross-over entertainment and LGBT specific websites. Additionally, we will utilize mobile apps and social media platforms to provide an immense world-wide LGBT audience reach. We intend to be a disruptive LGBT Ad Network and an industry leader by delivering digital content campaigns across display, mobile and video inventory. Our Ad network campaign rates will start at $15,000 and range to $50,000 per month, with a forecast average of $50,000 a month per advertising sponsor in year one and growing to an average of $75,000 a month per advertising sponsor in year two.

Our LGBT Media Content Agency is expected to bridge the gap and help companies to better understand how to authentically and directly engage with the LGBT consumer. We will do this through our proprietary application, which incorporates original and aggregated content integrated into an LGBT audience network. The Agency range rate will start at $25,000 and increase to $150,000. We are projecting an average of $75,000 a month per advertising sponsor for the first year and accelerating to $150,000 a month per advertising sponsor in year two.
 
Business Strategy Our strategy will include worldwide application of the LGBT network. Fortune 500 companies have now mandated diversity and equality as part of their annual marketing spend. Our mission is to become the worlds largest media and advertising network marketplace for connecting companies with LGBT consumers around the globe. Some of the companies currently advertising to the LGBT community include; AT&T, Lexus, Procter & Gamble, American Airlines, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson, Burger King, Subaru, Orbitz, Miller-Coors, HBO and many others. The foremost desire for LGBT consumers is to see themselves more widely represented in all forms of advertising. In the US 66 percent of LGBT consumers say that they don’t see their lifestyle represented enough in advertising. (YouGov) Data has estimated that LGBT consumers in the US, UK and Germany are more likely than the general public to act after seeing an advertisement. LifeApps has a licensing agreement in place that will allow placement of LGBT specific content over 300 mainstream networks worldwide. We will deliver sponsored advertising content through this network of the most popular mainstream entertainment websites covering News, Health & Fitness, Travel & Leisure, Business and Sports. Our sponsored advertising content will inspire an authentic relationship between advertisers and the consumer. These advertisers desire an authentic relationship with the LGBT community. We will not only help them create content but we will make sure their content hits the consumer bullseye. 
 We believe that the LGBT demographic is one of the most highly sought-after economic groups in the world from corporate America down to the local business owner. What makes targeting and supporting this dynamic demographic even more extraordinary and rewarding is that friends, family, employers, employees, teachers, coaches and fans of our community so loyally support the brands, products and services that in turn support us. We further believe that this loyalty across the board is time tested, proven, growing and expanding and ultimately extremely rewarding to all that are embraced by the LGBT community.
 
Competition 
 
The development, distribution and sale of digital publications and apps is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For end users, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, brand, customer reviews and price. We compete for promotional and deck placement based on these factors, as well as the relationship with the digital storefront owner or wireless carrier, historical performance, perception of sales potential and relationships with licensors of brands and other intellectual property. For content and brand licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners or carriers. We also compete for experienced and talented employees.
 
With respect to digital publications and apps that we publish for smartphones and tablets, we compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Meredith Publishing, WebMD and many well-funded private companies. We also compete for consumer spending with large companies, such as NIKE and Electronic Arts. In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch digital publications and apps and other content for these mobile devices utilizing relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for end users who purchase content for their smartphones and tablets without substantially increasing spending to market our products or increasing our development costs.
 
Most of our competitors’ and our potential competitors’ advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following:
 

● | significantly greater revenues and financial resources; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;

 Convertible Loans
 
On November 9, 2015 an individual (the “Lender”) made an unsecured convertible loan to LifeApps Brands Inc. (the “Company”) due and payable on March 21, 2016, in the principal amount of $25,000 bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan was evidenced in writing by the Company and the Lender when made and was convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock (“Common Stock”) at a price of $0.75 per share. On October 27, 2016 the Company and the Lender entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement in which they agreed to revise the conversion price from $0.75 per share to $0.0055 per share, which was the closing sale price for the Common Stock on October 27, 2016 and to convert the principal amount of the loan at the revised conversion price into 4,545,455 shares of Common Stock. In consideration of the revised conversion terms, the Lender agreed to waive the accrued interest due on the loan.
 
On April 5, 2016 the Lender made an unsecured loan to the Company in the principal amount of $15,000 bearing interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan was evidenced in writing by the Company and the Lender on October 27, 2016 at which time the parties determined that the loan, including the accrued interest due thereon, be due and payable on April 5, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”) and that it be convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price of $0.0055 per share which was the closing price for the Common Stock on October 27, 2016.
 
Effective December 19, 2017 the Lender converted $54,000 of the $55,500 in debt then owed to her by us, into 5,400,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $0.01 per share and forgave all interest accrued on the converted amount.

The Power Up Note entitles the holder to 12% interest per annum and matures on March 6, 2019.
 
Power Up may convert the Power Up Note into shares of our common stock beginning on the date which is 180 days from the issuance date of the Power Up Note, at a price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price for our common stock during the 15 trading day period ending on the last complete trading date prior to the date of conversion, provided, however, that Power Up may not convert the Power Up Note to the extent that such conversion would result in Power Up’s beneficial ownership being in excess of 4.99% of our issued and outstanding common stock together with all shares owned by Power Up and its affiliates at the time of conversion.
 
If we prepay the Power Up Note within 30 days of its issuance, we must pay all of the principal and accrued interest at a cash redemption premium of 115%; if such prepayment is made between the 31st day and the 60th day after the issuance of the Power Up Note , then such redemption premium is 120%; if such repayment is made from the 61st to the 90th day after issuance, then such redemption premium is 125%; if such repayment is made from the 91st to the 120th day after issuance, then such redemption premium is 130%; if such repayment is made from the 121st to the 150th day after issuance, then such redemption premium is 135%; and if such repayment is made from the 151st day to the 180th day after issuance then such redemption premium is 140%. After the expiration of the 180 days following the issuance, we have no further right of pre-payment.

The Advisory Agreement had a term of 30 days. We issued 500,000 shares of our restricted common stock under the Advisory Agreement.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in them being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution.
 
We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users. We currently collect certain personally identifiable information regarding our customers and expect in the future to collect additional personally identifiable information regarding our customers. Any concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. We post our privacy policy and our terms of service on our corporate website. In these policies, we describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of the information that we collect regarding our users. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the mobile gaming industry is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.
 
6


In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We sometimes offer our customers various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.
 
In addition, the advertisers that advertise with our apps are subject to Federal Trade Commission and state rules on advertising and marketing on the Internet, including truth-in advertising rules, online advertising disclosures and the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) of 2003.  To date, we have not been materially impacted by these rules because our platforms are designed to ensure that proper disclosures are made in connection with every publication.  We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or advertisers that advertise with our apps.
 
Further, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 2 employees, all of whom are full time employees.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Properties
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2435 Dixie Highway, Wilton, Florida 33305 and our telephone number is (858) 577-1746. The property is currently being rented on a month to month basis at a rate of $250 per month.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations.  Currently, no legal proceedings, government actions, administrative actions, investigations or claims are pending against us or involve us that, in the opinion of our management, could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Available Information
 
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).  Reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, including annual and quarterly reports, and other reports we file, can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
