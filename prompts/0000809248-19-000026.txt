ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
Our Company 
We are one of the largest restaurant companies in the United States and have been operating restaurants for more than 55 years. We are the largest Burger King® franchisee in the United States, based on number of restaurants, and have operated Burger King restaurants since 1976. As of December 30, 2018, we owned and operated 849 Burger King restaurants located in 18 Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states. Burger King restaurants feature the popular flame-broiled Whopper® sandwich, as well as a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, salads, breakfast items, snacks, soft drinks and other offerings. We believe that our size, seasoned management team, extensive operating infrastructure, experience and proven operating disciplines differentiate us from many of our competitors as well as many other Burger King operators. 
According to BKC, as of December 31, 2018 there were a total of 17,796 Burger King restaurants, of which almost all were franchised and 7,330 were located in the United States. Burger King is the second largest quick service hamburger restaurant chain in the world (as measured by number of restaurants) and we believe that the Burger King brand is one of the world's most recognized consumer brands. Burger King restaurants have a distinctive image and are generally located in high-traffic areas throughout the United States. Burger King restaurants are designed to appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers, with multiple day-part meal segments targeted to different groups of consumers. We believe that the competitive attributes of Burger King restaurants include significant brand recognition, convenience of location, quality, speed of service and price.
Our Burger King restaurants are typically open seven days per week and generally have operating hours ranging from 6:00 am to midnight on Sunday to Wednesday and to 2:00 am on Thursday to Saturday.
Our existing restaurants consist of one of several building types with various seating capacities. Our typical freestanding restaurant contains approximately 2,600 square feet with seating capacity for 60 to 70 customers, has drive-thru service windows and has adjacent parking areas. As of December 30, 2018, almost all of our restaurants were freestanding. We operate our restaurants under franchise agreements with BKC.
Our acquisition of 278 Burger King restaurants on May 30, 2012 from BKC, which we refer to as the "2012 acquisition", included BKC's assignment to us of its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers in 20 states as follows: Connecticut (except Hartford county), Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts (except for Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk counties), Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York (except for Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk and Westchester counties), North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, Washington DC and West Virginia (the "ROFR") pursuant to an operating agreement with BKC dated May 30, 2012, and which was amended on January 26, 2015 and December 17, 2015, which we refer to as the "amended operating agreement". In addition, pursuant to the amended operating agreement, BKC granted us, on a non-exclusive basis, franchise pre-approval to acquire restaurants from Burger King franchisees in the 20 states covered by the ROFR until we operate 1,000 Burger King restaurants. Newly 
3

constructed or acquired restaurants beyond 1,000 or acquisitions in states not subject to the ROFR would be subject to BKC's customary approval process. 
During 2018, we acquired a total of 44 restaurants from other franchisees in four separate transactions. During 2017, we acquired a total of 64 restaurants in three separate transactions and in 2016, we acquired 56 restaurants in seven separate transactions.
For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, our restaurants generated total revenues of $1,179.3 million and our comparable restaurant sales increased 3.8%. Our average annual restaurant sales for all restaurants were approximately $1.45 million per restaurant. 
 On February 20, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") dated as of February 19, 2019 to acquire 166 Burger King® and 55 Popeyes® restaurants from Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC ("Cambridge Holdings"). Cambridge Holdings will receive approximately 7.36 million shares of our common stock, and at closing will own approximately 16.6% of our outstanding common shares. Cambridge Holdings will also receive shares of 9% PIK Series C Convertible Preferred Stock that will be convertible into approximately 7.45 million shares of our common stock at $13.50 per share. The conversion of the preferred stock received by Cambridge Holdings will be subject to a vote of our stockholders which will occur at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and will automatically convert into common stock upon stockholder approval of such conversion. All shares issued to Cambridge Holdings are subject to a two year restriction on sale or transfer subject to certain limited exceptions. As part of the transaction, Cambridge Holdings will have the right to designate up to two director nominees and two Cambridge Holdings executives will join the Company's Board of Directors upon completion of the merger.
We expect to refinance the existing debt assumed as part of the transaction, along with our existing debt, through a new senior secured credit facility providing for term loan and revolving credit borrowings under a fully committed financing. The closing of the merger with Cambridge Holdings is not, however, conditioned on financing. 
We have entered into an Area Development and Remodeling Agreement (the "Area Development Agreement") with BKC which will be subject to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and have a term commencing on the date of the closing of the Merger Agreement and ending on September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, which will supersede the amended operating agreement, BKC will grant us franchise pre-approval and assign to us its right of first refusal on franchise restaurant transfers in 16 states until the date that we have acquired more than an aggregate of 500 Burger King Restaurants. We will pay BKC $3.0 million in equal quarterly installment payments in 2019. We also will agree to open, build and operate 200 new Burger King restaurants and will agree to remodel or upgrade 748 Burger King restaurants to BKC’s Burger King of Tomorrow restaurant image. The Area Development agreement includes a contribution by BKC of $10 million to $12 million for upgrades to approximately 50 to 60 Burger King restaurants in 2019 and 2020 where BKC is the landlord on the lease.

For a complete discussion of the Merger Agreement, committed debt financing and Area Development Agreement see "Item 1. Business - Recent Developments."
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Largest Burger King Franchisee in the United States.   We are the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States based on number of restaurants, and are well positioned to leverage the scale and marketing of one of the most recognized brands in the restaurant industry. We believe the geographic dispersion of our restaurants provides us with stability and enhanced growth opportunities in many of the markets in which we operate. We also believe that our large number of restaurants increases our ability to effectively manage the awareness of the Burger King brand in certain markets through our ability to influence local advertising and promotional activities. 
Operational Expertise.   We have been operating Burger King restaurants since 1976 and have developed sophisticated information and operating systems that enable us to measure and monitor key metrics for operational performance, sales and profitability that may not be available to other restaurant operators. Our focus on leveraging our operational 
4

expertise, infrastructure and systems allows us to optimize the performance of our restaurants and restaurants that we may acquire or open. Our size and history with the Burger King brand enable us to effectively track operating metrics and leverage best practices across our organization. We believe that our experienced management team, operating culture, effective operating systems and infrastructure enable us to operate more efficiently than many other Burger King operators, resulting in higher restaurant margins and improved overall financial results. 
Consistent Operating History and Financial Strength.   We believe that the quality and sophistication of our restaurant operations have helped drive our strong restaurant level performance. Comparable restaurant sales for our restaurants have generally outperformed the Burger King system. Our strong restaurant level operations coupled with our financial management capabilities have resulted in consistent and stable cash flows. We have demonstrated our ability to prudently manage our capital structure and financial leverage through a variety of economic cycles. We believe that our cash flow from operations, cash balances and the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our amended senior credit facility (and, in the event the Mergers and Financing, as defined below, are consummated, our New Senior Credit Facilities, as defined below) are sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures. 
Distinct Brand with Global Recognition, Innovative Marketing and New Product Development.   As a Burger King franchisee, we benefit from, and rely on, BKC's extensive marketing, advertising and product development capabilities to drive sales and generate increased restaurant traffic. Over the years, BKC has launched innovative and creative multimedia advertising campaigns and products that highlight the relevance of the Burger King brand. BKC has also introduced promotions that leverage both value and premium menu offerings as well as providing a platform for new premium sandwich offerings. We believe these campaigns continue to positively impact the brand today as BKC focuses on a well-balanced promotional mix and remains committed to focusing on impactful new product launches and limited time offers, both of which continue to show positive trends. BKC is also aggressively working with franchisees throughout the system to encourage the renovation and remodeling of restaurants to BKC's current image, which we believe will continue to increase customer traffic and restaurant sales.
Strategic Relationship with Burger King Corporation and RBI.    We believe that the structure of the 2012 acquisition strengthened our well-established relationship with BKC and RBI and has further aligned our common interests to grow our business. We intend to continue to expand by making acquisitions, including acquisitions resulting from the exercise of the ROFR as well as other negotiated acquisitions under our pre-approval rights. The consideration to BKC associated with the 2012 acquisition included a preferred stock equity interest in Carrols Restaurant Group, which is convertible into approximately 20.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Since the 2012 acquisition, two of BKC's or RBI's senior executives have served on our Board of Directors. Jose Cil, Chief Executive Officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc., and Matthew Dunnigan, Chief Financial Officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc., the indirect parent company of BKC, currently serve on our board of directors. Our restaurants represented approximately 11.6% of the Burger King locations in the United States as of December 30, 2018. We believe that the combination of our rights under the amended operating agreement (and the Area Development Agreement should such agreement become effective), BKC's equity interest and its board level representation will continue to reinforce the alignment of our common interests with BKC for the long term.
Multiple Growth Levers. We believe our historical track record of acquiring and integrating restaurants and our commitment to remodel, upgrade and open new restaurants provides multiple avenues to grow our business. With more than 55 years of restaurant operating experience, we have successfully grown our business through acquisitions. We have experienced increases in comparable restaurant sales, increased restaurant-level profitability and improved operating metrics at the restaurants we have acquired in the last five years. In addition, we have remodeled a total of 560 restaurants to BKC’s 20/20 restaurant image as of December 30, 2018 which we believe has improved our guests’ overall experience and increased customer traffic. At December 30, 2018, 681 of our restaurants had the BKC 20/20 image, which includes restaurants converted prior to our acquisition. 
Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record.    We believe that our senior management team's extensive experience in the restaurant industry and its long and successful history of developing, acquiring, integrating and operating quick-service restaurants provide us with a competitive advantage. Our management team has a successful history of integrating acquired restaurants, and over the past 20 years, we have significantly increased the number of 
5

Burger King restaurants we own and operate, largely through acquisitions. Our operations are overseen by our Chief Executive Officer, Dan Accordino, who has over 45 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience, a Divisional VP, and ten Regional Directors that have an average of 24 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Our 124 district managers that have an average tenure of over 16 years in the Burger King system support the Regional Directors. Our operations management is further supported by our infrastructure of financial, information systems, real estate, human resources and legal professionals. 
Our Business Strategies 
Our primary business strategies are as follows: 
Selectively Acquire and Develop Additional Burger King Restaurants. As of December 30, 2018, we operated 849 Burger King restaurants, making us the largest Burger King franchisees in the United States. We acquired the ROFR in the 2012 acquisition and were granted certain pre-approval rights to acquire additional franchised restaurants and to develop new restaurants. Due to the number of restaurants and franchisees in the Burger King system and our historical success in acquiring and integrating restaurants, we believe that there is considerable opportunity for future growth. There are more than 2,000 Burger King restaurants we do not own in states in which we have the ROFR and pre-approval rights. Furthermore, we believe there are additional Burger King restaurants in states not subject to the ROFR that could be attractive acquisition candidates, subject to BKC's customary approval. We believe that the assignment of the ROFR and the pre-approval to acquire and develop additional restaurants provide us with the opportunity to significantly expand our ownership of Burger King restaurants in the future. While we may evaluate and discuss potential acquisitions of additional restaurants from time to time, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions, other than the Merger Agreement with Cambridge Holdings. We may be required to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all.
Under the new Area Development Agreement which is subject to and effective upon the closing of the Mergers, BKC will assign to Carrols LLC the ADA ROFR in the ADA DMAs until the date that Carrols LLC has acquired an aggregate of 500 Burger King restaurants. In addition, pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, BKC will grant Carrols LLC franchise pre-approval to build new Burger King restaurants or acquire Burger King restaurants from Burger King franchisees in the ADA DMAs until the date that Carrols LLC acquires, in the aggregate, more than 500 Burger King restaurants.
Improve Profitability of Restaurants We Acquire by Leveraging Our Existing Infrastructure and Best-Practices.    For acquired restaurants, we believe we can realize benefits from economies of scale, including leveraging our existing infrastructure across a larger number of restaurants. Additionally, we believe that our skilled management team, sophisticated information technology, operating systems and training and development programs support our ability to enhance operating efficiencies at restaurants we may acquire. We have demonstrated our ability to increase the profitability of acquired restaurants and we believe, over time, that we will improve profitability and operational efficiency at the restaurants we have and may acquire.
Increase Restaurant Sales and Customer Traffic.    BKC has identified and implemented a number of strategies to increase brand awareness, increase market share, improve overall operations and drive sales. These strategies are central to our strategic objectives to deliver profitable growth. 

• | Products. The strength of the BKC menu has been built on a distinct flame-grilled cooking platform to make better tasting hamburgers. We believe that BKC intends to continue to optimize the menu by focusing on core products, such as the flagship Whopper® sandwich, while maintaining a balance between value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive sales and traffic. Recent product innovation has included a multi-tier balanced marketing approach with value and premium offerings, pairing value promotions, such as the $1.00 10-piece chicken nugget promotion with premium limited time Burger offerings, such as the Sourdough King sandwiches and Crispy Chicken. Promotional initiatives in 2018 included the 2 for $6 Mix and Match and 2 for $10 Meal Deal featuring the Whopper and Crispy Chicken sandwich. There have also been a number of enhancements to food preparation procedures to improve the quality of BKC's existing products. These new menu platforms and quality improvements form the backbone of BKC's strategy to appeal to a broader consumer base and to increase restaurant sales.

• | Image. We believe that re-imaged restaurants increase curb appeal and result in increased restaurant sales. BKC's current restaurant image features a fresh, sleek, eye-catching design which incorporates easy-to-navigate digital menu boards in the dining room, streamlined merchandising at the drive-thru and flat screen televisions in the dining area. We believe that restaurant remodeling has improved our guests' dining experience and increased customer traffic. As of December 30, 2018 a total of 681 of our restaurants had the BKC 20/20 restaurant image, which includes restaurants re-imaged prior to our acquisition. We believe the customer experience will be further enhanced from the upgrades to the Burger King of Tomorrow image that include a double drive-thru (where applicable), certain modifications to the exterior image and the installation of exterior digital menu boards as well as remodels that include the exterior design elements and an interior that creates a warm and welcoming restaurant designed to bring the outdoors inside. 


• | Advertising and Promotion. We believe that we will continue to benefit from BKC's advertising support of its menu items, product enhancement and re-imaging initiatives. BKC has established a data driven marketing process which has focused on driving restaurant sales and traffic, while targeting a broad consumer base with inclusive messaging. This strategy uses multiple touch points to advertise our products, including digital advertising, social media and on-line video in addition to traditional television advertising. BKC has a food-centric marketing strategy which focuses consumers on the food offerings, the core asset, and balances value promotions and premium limited time offerings to drive profitable restaurant sales and traffic.


• | Operations. We believe that improving restaurant operations and enhancing the customer experience are key components to increasing the profitability of our restaurants. We believe we will benefit from BKC's ongoing initiatives to improve food quality, simplify restaurant level execution and monitor operational performance, all of which are designed to improve the customer experience and increase customer traffic.

Strategically Remodel to Elevate Brand Profile and Increase Profit Potential. In 2019, we plan to remodel 20 to 25 locations to BKC's current image standard, including rebuilding 3 to 5 restaurants and to upgrade 60 to 70 restaurants from BKC 20/20 restaurant image to the Burger King of Tomorrow image, with a contribution from BKC of approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million under the Area Development Agreement, should it become effective, for restaurants whereby BKC is landlord on the lease. We also plan to construct 15 to 20 new restaurants (including relocations of 3 to 4 existing restaurants). We believe there are opportunities to increase profitability by remodeling additional restaurants including restaurants that we have acquired or may acquire in the future.
Restaurant Economics 
Selected restaurant operating data for our restaurants is as follows: 

 | Year Ended 
 | January 1, 2017 | | December 31, 2017 | | December 30, 2018
Average annual sales per restaurant (1) | $ | 1,311,516 | | | $ | 1,387,850 | | | $ | 1,449,047
Average sales transaction | $ | 6.85 | | | $ | 7.15 | | | $ | 7.37 
Drive-through sales as a percentage of total sales | 67.0 | % | | 67.9 | % | | 68.4 | %
Day-part sales percentages: | | | | | | | 
Breakfast | 13.8 | % | | 13.7 | % | | 13.5 | %
Lunch | 32.4 | % | | 32.3 | % | | 31.9 | %
Dinner | 20.4 | % | | 20.6 | % | | 20.9 | %
Afternoon and late night | 33.4 | % | | 33.4 | % | | 33.6 | %


(1) | Average annual sales per restaurant are derived by dividing restaurant sales by the average number of restaurants operating during the period on a 52-week basis.

Restaurant Capital Costs 
The initial cost of the franchise fee, equipment, seating, signage and other interior costs of a standard new Burger King restaurant currently is approximately $450,000 (which excludes the cost of the land, building and site improvements). In the markets in which we operate, the cost of land generally ranges from $500,000 to $900,000 and the cost of building and site improvements generally ranges from $850,000 to $1,025,000. 
7

With respect to development of freestanding restaurants, if we acquire the land to construct the building, we typically seek to thereafter enter into an arrangement to sell and leaseback the land and building under a long-term lease. Historically, we have been able to acquire and finance many of our locations under such leasing arrangements. Where we are unable to purchase the underlying land, we enter into a long-term lease for the land followed by construction of the building using cash generated from our operations or with borrowings under our senior credit facility. 
The cost of securing real estate and developing and equipping new restaurants can vary significantly and depends on a number of factors, including the local economic conditions and the characteristics of a particular site. Accordingly, the cost of opening new restaurants in the future may differ substantially from the historical cost of restaurants previously opened and the estimated costs above. 
BKC's current image restaurant design draws inspiration from its signature flame-grilled cooking process and incorporates a variety of innovative elements to a backdrop that evokes the warm and welcoming look of the outdoors including corrugated metal, brick, wood and concrete. The cost of remodeling a restaurant to the BKC current image varies depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed and can range from $250,000 to $650,000 per restaurant with a cost of approximately $650,000 per restaurant in 2018 and an average cost of $500,000 over the past three years. The total cost of a remodel has increased over time due to construction cost increases and the replacement of certain kitchen equipment at the time of the remodel which is incremental to the cost to upgrade to the BKC current image design. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent and Future Events Affecting our Results of Operations".
Site Selection
We believe that the location of our restaurants is a critical component of each restaurant's success. We evaluate potential new sites on many critical criteria including accessibility, visibility, costs, surrounding traffic patterns, competition and demographic characteristics. Our senior management determines the acceptability of all acquisition prospects and new sites, based upon analyses prepared by our real estate, financial and operations professionals.    
Seasonality 
Our business is moderately seasonal due to regional weather conditions. Due to the location of our restaurants, sales are generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months.

Operations
Management Structure 
We conduct substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing and operations support functions from our corporate headquarters in Syracuse, New York. Carrols Restaurant Group is led by our Chief Executive Officer and President, Daniel T. Accordino, who has over 45 years of Burger King and quick-service restaurant experience at our company. 
Operations for our restaurants are overseen by one Division VP and ten Regional Directors that have an average of over 24 years of Burger King restaurant experience. Our 124 district managers support the Regional Directors in the management of our restaurants. 
A district manager is responsible for the direct oversight of the day-to-day operations of an average of approximately seven to eight restaurants.  Typically, district managers have previously served as restaurant managers at one of our restaurants.  Regional directors, district managers and restaurant managers are compensated with a fixed salary plus an incentive bonus based upon the performance of the restaurants under their supervision, and for our regional directors and district managers, the combined performance of all of our restaurants.  Typically, our restaurants are staffed with hourly employees who are supervised by a salaried general manager and one to three assistant managers. 
Training 
We maintain a comprehensive training and development program for all of our personnel and provide both classroom and in-restaurant training for our salaried and hourly personnel. The program emphasizes system-wide operating procedures, food preparation methods, food safety and customer service standards. BKC's training and development programs are also available to us as a franchisee through web access in all of our restaurants. 
Management Information Systems 
Our sophisticated management information systems provide us the ability to efficiently and effectively manage our restaurants and to ensure consistent application of operating controls at our restaurants. Our size affords us the ability to maintain an in-house staff of information technology and restaurant systems professionals dedicated to 
9

continuously enhancing our systems. In addition, these capabilities allow us to quickly integrate restaurants that we acquire and achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies. 
We typically replace the POS systems at restaurants we acquire shortly after acquisition and implement our POS, labor and inventory management systems. Our restaurants employ touch-screen POS systems that are designed to facilitate accuracy and speed of order taking. These systems are user-friendly, require limited cashier training and improve speed-of-service through the use of conversational order-taking techniques. The POS systems are integrated with PC-based applications at the restaurant and hosted systems at our corporate office that are designed to facilitate financial and management control of our restaurant operations. 
Our restaurant systems provide daily tracking and reporting of traffic counts, menu item sales, labor and food data including costs and inventories, and other key operating metrics for each restaurant. We communicate electronically with our restaurants on a continuous basis via a high-speed data network, which enables us to collect this information for use in our corporate management systems in near real-time. Our corporate headquarters manages systems that support all of our accounting, operating and reporting systems. We also operate a 24-hour, seven-day help desk at our corporate headquarters that enables us to provide systems and operational support to our restaurant operations as required. Among other things, our restaurant information systems provide us with the ability to: 

• | monitor labor utilization and sales trends on a real-time basis at each restaurant, enabling the restaurant manager to effectively manage to our established labor standards on a timely basis;


• | reduce inventory shrinkage using restaurant-level inventory management systems and daily reporting of inventory variances;


• | analyze sales and product mix data to help restaurant managers forecast production levels throughout the day;


• | monitor day-part drive-thru speed of service at each of our restaurants;


• | allow the restaurant manager to produce day-part labor schedules based on the restaurant's historical sales patterns;


• | systematically communicate human resource and payroll data to our administrative offices for efficient centralized management of labor costs and payroll processing;


• | employ centralized control over pricing, menu and inventory management activities at the restaurant utilizing the remote management capabilities of our systems;


• | take advantage of electronic commerce including our ability to place orders with suppliers and to integrate detailed invoice, receiving and product data with our inventory and accounting systems;


• | provide analyses, reporting and tools to enable all levels of management to review a wide-range of financial, product mix and operational data; and


• | systematically analyze and report on detailed transactional data to help detect and identify potential theft.

Critical information from our systems is available in near real-time to our restaurant managers, who are expected to react quickly to trends or situations in their restaurant. Our district managers also receive near real-time information for their respective restaurants and have access to key operating data on a remote basis using our corporate intranet-based reporting. Management personnel at all levels, from the restaurant manager through senior management, utilize and monitor key restaurant performance indicators that are also included in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans.
Burger King Franchise Agreements 
Each of our Burger King restaurants operates under a separate franchise agreement with BKC. Our franchise agreements with BKC generally require, among other things, that all restaurants comply with specified design criteria and operate in a prescribed manner, including utilization of the standard Burger King menu. In addition, our Burger King franchise agreements generally require that our restaurants conform to BKC's current image and may provide for updating our restaurants during the tenth year of the agreements to conform to such current image, which may require significant expenditures. We expect these update expenditures in 2019 to range from $100,000 to $300,000 per restaurant. 
These franchise agreements with BKC generally provide for an initial term of 20 years and currently have an initial franchise fee of $50,000. In the event that we terminate any franchise agreement and close the related BKC 
10

restaurant prior to the expiration of its term, we generally are required to pay BKC an amount based on the net present value of the royalty stream that would have been realized by BKC had such franchise agreement not been terminated. Any franchise agreement, including renewals, can be extended at our discretion for an additional 20-year term, with BKC's approval, provided that, among other things, the restaurant meets the current Burger King operating and image standards and that we are not in default under the terms of the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement fee for subsequent renewals is currently $50,000. BKC may terminate any of the franchise agreements if an act of default is committed by us under these agreements and such default is not cured. Defaults under the franchise agreements include, among other things, our failure to operate such Burger King restaurant in accordance with the operating standards and specifications established by BKC (including failure to use equipment, uniforms or decor approved by BKC), our failure to sell products approved or designated by BKC, our failure to pay royalties or advertising and sales promotion contributions as required, our unauthorized sale, transfer or assignment of such franchise agreement or the related restaurant, certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, conduct by us or our employees that has a harmful effect on the Burger King restaurant system, conviction of us or our executive officers for certain indictable offenses, our failure to maintain a responsible credit rating or our acquisition of an interest in any other hamburger restaurant business. At December 30, 2018, we were not in default under any of our franchise agreements with BKC. 
In order to obtain a successor franchise agreement with BKC, a franchisee is typically required to make capital improvements to the restaurant to bring it up to BKC's current image standards. The cost of these improvements may vary widely depending upon the magnitude of the required changes and the degree to which we have made interim improvements to the restaurant. At December 30, 2018, we had 33 franchise agreements due to expire in 2019, 55 franchise agreements due to expire in 2020 and 12 franchise agreements due to expire in 2021. In recent years, the historical costs of improving our Burger King restaurants in connection with franchise renewals generally have ranged from $250,000 to $650,000 per restaurant. The average cost of our remodels in 2018 was approximately $650,000 per restaurant. The cost of remodels can vary depending upon the age and condition of the restaurant and the amount of new equipment needed. The cost of capital improvements made in connection with future franchise agreement renewals may differ substantially from past franchise renewals depending on the current image requirements established from time to time by BKC. 
We believe that we will be able to satisfy BKC's normal franchise agreement renewal criteria. Accordingly, we believe that renewal franchise agreements will be granted on a timely basis by BKC at the expiration of our existing franchise agreements. Historically, BKC has granted all of our requests for successor franchise agreements. However, there can be no assurance that BKC will grant these requests in the future. 
We evaluate the performance of our Burger King restaurants on an ongoing basis. With respect to franchise renewals, such evaluation depends on many factors, including our assessment of the anticipated future operating results of the subject restaurants and the cost of required capital improvements that we would need to commit for such restaurants. If we determine that a Burger King restaurant is under-performing, or that we do not anticipate an adequate return on the capital investment required to renew the franchise agreement, we may elect to close such restaurant. We may also relocate (offset) a restaurant within its trade area and build a new Burger King restaurant as part of the franchise renewal process. In 2018, we closed 10 restaurants, including one offset location. We currently expect to close between 8 to 12 restaurants in 2019, excluding any relocations of existing restaurants. Our determination to close these restaurants is subject to further evaluation and may change. We may also elect to close additional restaurants in the future. 
In addition to the initial franchise fee, we generally pay BKC a monthly royalty. The royalty rate for new restaurants and for successor franchise agreements is 4.5% of sales. Royalty payments for restaurants acquired from other franchisees are based on the terms of existing franchise agreements being acquired, and may be less than 4.5%. The royalty rate was increased from 3.5% to 4.5% of sales in 2000, and generally for restaurants that were in existence in 2000, becomes effective upon the renewal of the franchise agreement. Burger King royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, were 4.3% in both 2018 and 2017 and 4.2% in 2016. We anticipate our Burger King royalties, as a percentage of restaurant sales, will be 4.3% in 2019 as a result of the terms outlined above. Under the Area Development Agreement, should it becomes effective, newly constructed units will receive a 1% royalty rate reduction a four year period and certain remodeled restaurants, excluding upgrades, will receive a 0.75% royalty rate reduction for a five year period.
We also generally contribute 4% of restaurant sales from our Burger King restaurants to fund BKC's national and regional advertising. Under the Area Development Agreement, should it becomes effective, newly constructed 
11

units will receive a 3% advertising contribution deduction for four years and on certain remodeled restaurants, excluding upgrades, will receive a 0.75% advertising contribution reduction for a five year period. BKC engages in substantial national and regional advertising and promotional activities and other efforts to maintain and enhance the Burger King brand. From time to time we supplement BKC's marketing with our own local advertising and promotional campaigns. See “- Advertising, Products and Promotion” below. 
Our franchise agreements with BKC do not give us exclusive rights to operate Burger King restaurants in any defined territory. Although we believe that BKC generally seeks to ensure that newly granted franchises do not materially adversely affect the operations of existing Burger King restaurants, we cannot assure you that franchises granted by BKC to third parties will not adversely affect any Burger King restaurants that we operate. 
Except as permitted by the amended operating agreement, we are required to obtain BKC's consent before we acquire existing Burger King restaurants from other franchisees or develop new Burger King restaurants. BKC also has the right of first refusal to purchase any Burger King restaurant that is being offered for sale by a franchisee. However, pursuant to the operating agreement, BKC assigned the ROFR to us in 20 states and granted us franchise pre-approval to build new restaurants or acquire restaurants from franchisees until the date that we operate 1,000 restaurants. Historically, BKC has approved substantially all of our acquisitions of restaurants from other franchisees. 
Advertising, Products and Promotion 
BKC's marketing strategy is characterized by its HAVE IT YOUR WAY® service, TASTE IS KING® tag line, flame grilling, generous portions and competitive prices. Burger King restaurants feature flame-grilled hamburgers, the most popular of which is the Whopper® sandwich, a large, flame-grilled hamburger garnished with mayonnaise, lettuce, onions, pickles and tomatoes. The basic menu of all Burger King restaurants also includes a variety of hamburgers, chicken and other specialty sandwiches, french fries, soft drinks, salads, breakfast items, snacks, and other offerings. BKC and its franchisees have historically spent between 4% and 5% of their respective sales on marketing, advertising and promotion to sustain high brand awareness. BKC's marketing initiatives are designed to reach a diverse consumer base and BKC has continued to introduce a number of new and enhanced products to broaden menu offerings and drive customer traffic in all day parts.
We are generally required to contribute 4% of restaurant sales to an advertising fund utilized by BKC for its advertising, promotional programs and public relations activities. BKC's advertising programs consist of national campaigns supplemented by local advertising. BKC's advertising campaigns are generally carried on television, radio and in circulated print media (national and regional newspapers and magazines). As a percentage of our restaurant sales advertising expense was 4.1% in 2018, 4.1% in 2017 and 4.4% in 2016. For 2019 we expect advertising expense to range between 4.0% and 4.2% of restaurant sales.
The efficiency and quality of advertising and promotional programs can significantly affect the quick-service restaurant businesses. We believe that one of the major advantages of being a Burger King franchisee is the value of the extensive national and regional advertising and promotional programs conducted by BKC. In addition to the benefits derived from BKC's advertising spending, we sometimes supplement BKC's advertising and promotional activities with our own local advertising and promotions, including the purchase of additional television, radio and print advertising. The concentration of our Burger King restaurants in many of our markets permits us to leverage advertising in those markets. We also utilize promotional programs, such as combination value meals and discounted prices, targeted to our customers, in order to create a flexible and directed marketing program. 
Suppliers
We are a member of a national purchasing cooperative, Restaurant Services, Inc., which we refer to as "RSI", created for the Burger King system. RSI is a non-profit independent purchasing cooperative that is responsible for sourcing our products and related supplies and managing relationships with approved distributors for the Burger King system. We use our purchasing power to negotiate directly with certain other vendors, to obtain favorable pricing and terms for supplying our restaurants. For our restaurants, we are required to purchase all of our foodstuffs, paper goods and packaging materials from BKC-approved suppliers at prices negotiated by RSI. We currently utilize mostly three distributors, Maines Paper & Food Service, Inc., McLane Company Inc., and Reinhart Food Service L.L.C., to supply our restaurants with the majority of our foodstuffs and, as of December 30, 2018, such distributors supplied 40%, 32% and 28%, respectively, of our restaurants. We may purchase non-food items, such as kitchen utensils, equipment maintenance tools and other supplies, from any suitable source so long as such items meet BKC product uniformity 
12

standards. All BKC-approved distributors are required to purchase foodstuffs and supplies from BKC-approved manufacturers and purveyors. BKC is responsible for monitoring quality control and supervision of these manufacturers and conducts regular visits to observe the preparation of foodstuffs, and to perform various tests to ensure that only quality foodstuffs are sold to its approved suppliers. In addition, BKC coordinates and supervises audits of approved suppliers and distributors to determine continuing product specification compliance and to ensure that manufacturing plant and distribution center standards are met. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply available to our restaurants, in the event any distributor or supplier for our restaurants was unable to service us, this could lead to a disruption of service or supply at our restaurants until a new distributor or supplier is engaged, which could have an adverse effect on our business. 
Quality Assurance 
Our operational focus is closely monitored to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction based on product quality, speed of service, order accuracy and quality of service. Our senior management and restaurant management staffs are principally responsible for ensuring compliance with BKC's required operating procedures. We have uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the quality, preparation and selection of menu items, maintenance and cleanliness of the premises and employee conduct. In order to maintain compliance with these operating standards and specifications, we distribute detailed reports measuring compliance with various customer service standards and objectives to our restaurant operations management team, including feedback obtained directly from our customers through instructions given to them at the point of sale. The customer feedback is monitored by an independent agency and us and consists of evaluations of speed of service, quality of service, quality of our menu items and other operational objectives including the cleanliness of our restaurants. We also have our own staff that handle customer inquiries and complaints. The level of customer satisfaction is a key metric in our restaurant-level incentive bonus plans. 
We operate in accordance with quality assurance and health standards mandated by federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations. These standards include food preparation rules regarding, among other things, minimum cooking times and temperatures, maximum time standards for holding prepared food, food handling guidelines and cleanliness. To maintain these standards, under BKC's oversight third-party firms conduct unscheduled inspections and follow-up inspections of our restaurants and report their findings to us. In addition, restaurant managers conduct internal inspections for taste, quality, cleanliness and food safety on a regular basis. 
Trademarks 
As a franchisee of Burger King, we also have contractual rights to use certain BKC-owned trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property relating to the Burger King concept. We have no proprietary intellectual property other than the Carrols logo and trademark. 
Government Regulation 
Various federal, state and local laws affect our business, including various health, sanitation, fire and safety standards. Restaurants to be constructed or remodeled are subject to state and local building code and zoning requirements. In connection with the development and remodeling of our restaurants, we may incur costs to meet certain federal, state and local regulations, including regulations promulgated under the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
We are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as the handling, preparation and sale of food and beverages; the provision of nutritional information on menu boards; minimum wage requirements; unemployment compensation; overtime; and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. 
A significant number of our food service personnel are paid at rates related to the federal, and where applicable, state minimum wage and, accordingly, increases in the minimum wage have increased and in the future will increase wage rates at our restaurants. 
13

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Act”) required businesses employing fifty or more full-time equivalent employees to offer health care benefits to those full-time employees or be subject to an annual penalty. Those benefits must be provided under a health care plan which provides a certain minimum scope of health care services. The Act also limits the portion of the cost of the benefits which we can require employees to pay. Based on our enrollment history to date, approximately 12% of our approximately 2,500 eligible hourly employees have opted for coverage under our medical plan.
We are also subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our costs for compliance with environmental laws or regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition in the past.
Industry and Competition 
The Restaurant Market. Restaurant sales historically have closely tracked several macroeconomic indicators and we believe that “away-from-home” food consumption will increase due to these trends in recent years. Historically, unemployment has been inversely related to restaurant sales and, as the unemployment rate decreases and disposable income increases, restaurant sales have increased. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, through July 2018 food away from home dollars exceeded at-home dining, with 50.9% of nominal food dollars spent on food away from home and with total expenditures increasing 4.2% from the same period in 2017.
Quick-Service Restaurants. We operate in the hamburger category of the quick-service restaurant segment of the restaurant industry. Quick-service restaurants are distinguished by high speed of service and efficiency, convenience, limited menu and service, and value pricing. According to Nation's Restaurant News, 2017 U.S. foodservice sales for the Top 200 restaurant chains increased 3.0% from 2016 to $291.6 billion. Of this amount, the hamburger category represented $83.1 billion, or 28.5%, making it the largest category of the quick-service segment.
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location and food quality. In each of our markets, our restaurants compete with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as locally owned restaurants, offering low and medium-priced fare. We also compete with operators outside the restaurant industry such as convenience stores, delicatessens and prepared food counters in supermarkets, grocery stores, cafeterias and other purveyors offering moderately priced and quickly prepared foods. Our competitors may also employ marketing strategies such as frequent use of price discounting, frequent promotions and emphasis on value menus. 
We believe that: 

• | product quality and taste;


• | brand recognition;


• | convenience of location;


• | speed of service;


• | menu variety;


• | price; and


• | ambiance

are the most important competitive factors in the quick-service restaurant segment and that our restaurants effectively compete in each category. We believe our largest competitors are McDonald's and Wendy's. 
Employees 
As of December 30, 2018, we employed approximately 24,500 persons of which approximately 160 were administrative personnel and approximately 24,340 were restaurant operations personnel. None of our employees are unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.

Recent Developments
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock
On November 30, 2018, Carrols Restaurant Group entered into a Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with BKC. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, BKC exchanged (the “Exchange”) 100 shares (the “Series A Shares”) of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) of Carrols Restaurant Group held by BKC for 100 shares (the “Series B Shares”) of Carrols Restaurant Group's Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) newly issued by Carrols Restaurant Group. The powers, preferences and rights of the Series B Shares are substantially similar to those of the Series A Shares (including, without limitation, that the Series B Shares are convertible into the same number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's common stock on an as-converted basis as the Series A Shares), except that the Series B Shares may be transferred by BKC to certain other entities that are both affiliates of BKC and either RBI or Restaurant Brands International Limited Partnership (“RBI LP”), each an indirect parent of BKC (such affiliates of BKC and RBI or RBI LP, the “RBI Investors”), without the termination of the Rights (as defined below) that were previously granted solely to BKC pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate of Designations”). 
On November 30, 2018, in connection with the Exchange, Carrols Restaurant Group (i) upon issuance of 100 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to BKC pursuant to a Certificate of Designation of Series B Preferred Stock, dated as of November 30, 2018 (the “Series B Certificate of Designations”) and (ii) upon receipt of the 100 Series A Shares, which constituted all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, retired the Series A Preferred Stock by filing a Certificate of Retirement of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of Carrols Restaurant Group (the “Certificate of Retirement”) with the Secretary of State of Delaware as part of Carrols Restaurant Group's Certificate of Incorporation, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"). The Certificate of Retirement permanently retires the Series A Preferred Stock and eliminates all references to the Series A Preferred Stock from Carrols Restaurant Group's Certificate of Incorporation.
Each of the Series B Shares is convertible into 94,145.80 shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock"), or an aggregate of 9,414,580 shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock constituting approximately 20.3% of the outstanding shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock (the “Series B Conversion Shares”) on an as-converted basis after giving effect to the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock (which is the exact same number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock that the Series A Shares were convertible into).

The Series B Certificate of Designation provides that the RBI Investors will have certain rights (collectively, the “Rights”) including approval rights, so long as they collectively own greater than 10% of the outstanding shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock (on an as-converted basis) with regards to, among other things: (a) modifying Carrols Restaurant Group's organizational documents; (b) amending the size of Carrols Restaurant Group's Board of Directors; (c) authorizing or consummating any liquidation event (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations), except as permitted pursuant to the amended operating agreement; (d) engaging in any business other than the acquisition and operation of Burger King restaurants, except following a bankruptcy filing, reorganization or insolvency proceeding by or against BKC or RBI, which filing has not been dismissed within 60 days; and (g) issuing, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock in an amount exceeding 35% of the total number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance. The Series B Preferred Stock votes with the Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock on an as-converted basis and will provide for the right of the RBI Investors to elect two members of Carrols Restaurant Group's Board of Directors as Class B members until the date on which the number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock into which the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by the RBI Investors are then convertible constitutes less than 14.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock (the “BKC Director Step-Down Date”). From the BKC Director Step-Down Date to the date on which the number of shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock into which the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by the RBI Investors are then convertible constitute less than 10% of the total number of outstanding shares of Carrols 
15

Restaurant Group Common Stock, the RBI Investors will have the right to elect one member to Carrols Restaurant Group's Board of Directors as a Class B member. The Series B Preferred Stock will rank senior to Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock with respect to rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution of Carrols Restaurant Group. The Series B Preferred Stock will receive dividends and amounts upon a liquidation event (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designations) on an as converted basis.
The Exchange Agreement also provides that the Series B Conversion Shares are to be included as “Registrable Securities,” as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement (the "BKC Registration Rights Agreement"), dated May 30, 2012, by and between the Company and BKC, and which provides for certain registration rights for the shares of Carrols Restaurant Group's Common Stock.

The Merger Agreement

On February 19, 2019, Carrols Restaurant Group, Carrols Holdco Inc. ("NewCRG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group, GRC MergerSub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG, and GRC MergerSub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG (“Carrols CFP Merger Sub”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Cambridge Franchise Partners, LLC ("CFP"), Cambridge Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of CFP, and New CFH, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cambridge Holdings (“New CFH”), pursuant to which Carrols Restaurant Group has agreed to purchase the business of the subsidiaries of Cambridge Holdings, which includes 166 Burger King® restaurants, 55 Popeyes® restaurants, six convenience stores and certain real property through (i) a merger of Carrols Merger Sub and Carrols Restaurant Group with Carrols Restaurant Group as the surviving entity which will result in Carrols Restaurant Group becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of NewCRG (the “Holding Company Reorganization”) and (ii) the merger of Carrols CFP Merger Sub and New CFH with New CFH as the surviving entity (the “Cambridge Merger” and, together with the Holding Company Reorganization, the “Mergers”), in consideration of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of NewCRG (“NewCRG Common Stock”) equal to 19.9% of the outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock calculated immediately prior to the issuance of NewCRG Common Stock to Cambridge Holdings (the “NewCRG Investor Shares”) and 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of NewCRG (the “NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock”).

The Merger Agreement may be terminated, among other things, (i) by mutual consent of Carrols Restaurant Group and Cambridge Holdings, (ii) by Carrols Restaurant Group or Cambridge Holdings upon a breach of a representation and warranty in the Merger Agreement by the other which has not been cured or (iii) if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or prior to June 15, 2019. The Merger Agreement contains certain representations and warranties and covenants as specified therein, including such provisions as are customary for a transaction of this nature.
NewCRG Series C Convertible Preferred Stock

In connection with the closing of the Cambridge Merger, NewCRG will issue to Cambridge Holdings, 10,000 shares of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to a Certificate of Designations (the “Series C Certificate of Designations”) which will be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State immediately prior to the completion of the Mergers. The New CRG Series C Preferred Stock shall (i) accrue a dividend (the “Dividend”) of 9% per annum (accrued on a daily basis) that will be payable by increasing the Stated Value (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designations) per share of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock every six months from the date of issuance (a “Dividend Payment Date”), provided that if the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock is converted into NewCRG Common Stock prior to a Dividend Payment Date, any accrued and unpaid dividend since the date of the prior Dividend Payment Date shall be forfeited upon conversion, (ii) be subject to certain restrictions limiting the conversion of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock and the issuance of shares of NewCRG Common Stock upon conversion (the “Issuance Restriction”), as further 
16

described below, (iii) be initially (on the Effective Time, as defined in the Merger Agreement) convertible into a number of shares of NewCRG Common Stock equal to the quotient of (1) the difference of (A) the Equity Consideration Amount and (B) the product of (x) the number of NewCRG Investor Shares and (y) 13.5 and (2) 13.5, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions set forth in the Certificate of Designations and (iii) be automatically convertible into shares of NewCRG Common Stock upon Stockholder Approval (as defined below). The “Equity Consideration Amount” means the difference of (a) $200,000,000 and (b) the amount, if any, by which Net Debt (as defined in the Merger Agreement) exceeds $115,000,000. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the removal of the Issuance Restriction will be subject to obtaining the approval of NewCRG’s stockholders at its next annual meeting of stockholders to be held after the closing of the transaction or at subsequent meetings of stockholders, if necessary, until the approval of NewCRG’s stockholders is obtained (the “Stockholder Approval”). The NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock will rank senior to the NewCRG Common Stock and NewCRG’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to (i) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of NewCRG, (ii) the consummation of a merger or consolidation in which the stockholders of NewCRG prior to such transaction own less than a majority of the voting securities of (a) the entity surviving or resulting from such transaction or (b) if the surviving or resulting entity is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation or entity immediately following such transaction, the parent corporation or entity of such surviving or resulting entity, or (iii) the sale, distribution or other disposition of all or substantially all of NewCRG’s assets (on a consolidated basis). In addition, the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock will receive dividends on an as converted basis without regard to the Issuance Restriction. The prior consent of holders of at least a majority of the shares of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding is required to, among other things, (i) (A) authorize, create, designate, establish or issue an increased number of shares of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock or any other class or series of capital stock ranking senior to or on parity with the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation or (B) reclassifying any shares of NewCRG Common Stock into shares of capital stock having preference or priority as to dividends or upon liquidation senior to or on parity with such preference or priority of the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) amend the Series C Certificate of Designations or (iii) amend NewCRG’s organizational documents in a manner adverse to the rights, powers or preferences of the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock or holders of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock in their capacity as such.

Holding Company Reorganization

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, immediately prior to the completion of the Cambridge Merger, Carrols Restaurant Group will implement the Holding Company Reorganization, which will result in NewCRG owning all of the capital stock of Carrols Restaurant Group. NewCRG will initially be a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group. Pursuant to the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Merger Sub, a newly formed entity and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Carrols Restaurant Group, will merge with and into Carrols Restaurant Group, with Carrols Restaurant Group surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCRG. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Common Stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock being converted. Each share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization will automatically be exchanged into an equivalent corresponding share of NewCRG Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Carrols Restaurant Group Series B Preferred Stock being converted. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, Carrols Restaurant Group's current stockholders will become stockholders of NewCRG.

The Holding Company Reorganization will be conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the DGCL, which provides for the formation of a holding company through a merger without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations. Effective upon the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, NewCRG will adopt an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that are identical to those of Carrols Restaurant Group immediately prior to the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, except for the change of the name of the corporation as permitted by Section 251(g). Furthermore, the conversion will occur 
17

automatically without an exchange of stock certificates. Stock certificates previously representing shares of a class of Carrols Restaurant Group stock will represent the same number of shares of the corresponding class of NewCRG stock after the Holding Company Reorganization. Each person entered as the owner in a book entry that, immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization, represented any outstanding shares of Carrols Restaurant Group Common Stock shall be deemed to have received an equivalent number of shares of NewCRG Common Stock. Following the consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the name of NewCRG will be changed to “Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc.”, the name of Carrols Restaurant Group will be changed to “Carrols Holdco Inc.”, and shares of NewCRG Common Stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the Carrols Restaurant Group's symbol “TAST”.

Upon consummation of the Holding Company Reorganization, the directors and officers of New CRG will be the same individuals who are the directors and officers of Carrols Restaurant Group immediately prior to the Holding Company Reorganization.

Carrols LLC, Carrols, Carrols Restaurant Group and BKC have entered into the Area Development Agreement which will be subject to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and effective and have a term commencing on, the date of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and ending on September 30, 2024. Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, BKC will assign to Carrols LLC its right of first refusal under its franchise agreements with its franchisees to purchase all of the assets of a Burger King restaurant or all or substantially all of the voting stock of the franchisee, whether direct or indirect, on the same terms proposed between such franchisee and a third party purchaser (the “ADA ROFR”), in 16 states, which include Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia (subject to certain exceptions for certain limited geographic areas within certain states) (collectively, the “ADA DMAs”) until the date that Carrols LLC has acquired more than an aggregate of 500 Burger King Restaurants. The continued assignment of the ADA ROFR is subject to suspension or termination in the event of non-compliance by Carrols LLC with certain terms as set forth in the Area Development Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, BKC will grant Carrols LLC franchise pre-approval (the “ADA Franchise Pre-Approval”) to build new Burger King restaurants or acquire Burger King restaurants from Burger King franchisees in the ADA DMAs until the date that Carrols LLC acquires, in the aggregate, more than 500 Burger King restaurants inside or outside of the ADA DMAs. The grant by BKC to Carrols LLC of ADA Franchise Pre-Approval to develop new Burger King restaurants in the ADA DMA’s is a non-exclusive right, subject to customary BKC franchise, site and construction approval as specified in the Area Development Agreement. Carrols LLC will pay BKC $3.0 million for the ADA ROFR payable in four equal installment payments in 2019. 
Pursuant to the Area Development Agreement, Carrols LLC will agree to open, build and operate 200 new Burger King restaurants including 7 Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2019, 32 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2020, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2021, 41 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2022, 40 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2023 and 39 additional Burger King restaurants by September 30, 2024, subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Area Development Agreement.

18

Agreement, (b) $1,600,000 on October 1, 2019, (c) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2020, (d) $2,050,000 on October 1, 2021, (e) $2,000,000 on October 1, 2022 and (f) $1,950,000 on October 1, 2023.

The Area Development Agreement when effective, will supersede the amended operating agreement.

Commitment Letter

In connection with Carrols Restaurant Group's entry into the Merger Agreement, Carrols Restaurant Group entered into an amended and restated commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo Bank”), Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells Fargo Securities"), Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch (“Rabobank”), Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T Bank”) and SunTrust Bank ("SunTrust Bank" and together with Wells Fargo Bank, Rabobank and M&T Bank, the "Lenders") and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. ("STRH"), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide $500.0 million in debt financing (the “Financing”) to NewCRG. Wells Fargo Bank will act as the sole administrative agent. Wells Fargo Securities, Rabobank, M&T Bank and STRH will act as joint bookrunners and joint lead arrangers (the "Joint Lead Arrangers").

Pursuant to which and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, the Lenders have committed to provide to NewCRG, substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the Mergers, senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million, consisting of (i) a term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the “Term Loan B Facility”) and (ii) a revolving credit facility (including a sub-facility for standby letters of credit) in an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Term Loan B Facility, the “New Senior Credit Facilities”), all on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter. 

The proceeds of the Term Loan B Facility will be used to refinance the existing indebtedness of (i) Carrols Restaurant Group and (ii) New CFH and its subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent provided in the Commitment Letter (collectively, the “Refinancing”) and the payment of fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Commitment Letter (the “Transactions”). The proceeds of the New Revolving Credit Facility will be used to finance (i) the Refinancing, (ii) the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions and (iii) ongoing working capital and for other general corporate purposes of NewCRG and its subsidiaries, including permitted acquisitions and required expenditures under development agreements.

The Joint Lead Arrangers intend to secure commitments for the New Senior Credit Facilities from a syndicate of banks, financial institutions and other entities identified by Wells Fargo Securities in consultation with NewCRG. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the successful syndication of the New Senior Credit Facilities does not constitute a condition precedent to the funding thereof.

Borrowings under the New Senior Credit Facilities will bear interest, at NewCRG’s election, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Base Rate (as defined in the Commitment Letter) plus 2.75% or (b) LIBOR (as defined in the Commitment Letter) plus 3.75%. The Financing also will be subject to certain fees, including arrangement fees, upfront fees, agent fees, unused commitment fees and mandatory prepayment premiums.

All borrowings under the Term Loan B Facility will be made in a single drawing on the closing date of the Mergers. Repayments and prepayments of the Term Loan B Facility may not be re-borrowed. Regularly scheduled principal payments will be required on the Term Loan B Facility, as set forth in the Commitment Letter. The Term Loan B Facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan B Facility with the remainder due on the Term Loan B Facility maturity date. The Term Loan B Facility will mature five years after the closing date, while the New Revolving Credit Facility will mature seven years after the closing date.

As contemplated by the Commitment Letter, loans under the New Senior Credit Facilities may be prepaid and unused commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be reduced at any time, in whole or in part, at the 
19

option of the NewCRG, upon notice and in minimum principal amounts and in multiples to be agreed upon, without premium or penalty (except as set forth in the Commitment Letter). Any optional prepayment of the Term Loan B Facility or any incremental term loan facility will be applied as directed by NewCRG.

The Commitment Letter provides that subject to certain customary exceptions, exclusions, limitations and thresholds to be set forth in the definitive documentation related to the New Senior Credit Facilities, (a) the New Senior Credit Facilities will be guaranteed by each existing and subsequently acquired or formed direct and indirect material domestic restricted subsidiary of NewCRG (each a “New Senior Credit Facilities Guarantor” and together with NewCRG, the “New Senior Credit Facilities Credit Parties”), and (b) the obligations of the New Senior Credit Facilities Credit Parties under the New Senior Credit Facilities will be secured by first priority security interests in and liens on substantially all of the assets of the New Senior Credit Facilities Credit Parties.
Once funded, the New Senior Credit Facilities documentation will contain affirmative and negative covenants customarily applicable to senior secured credit facilities, including the requirement that the NewCRG and its subsidiaries maintain a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Commitment Letter) (such requirement, the “Financial Covenant”). The Commitment Letter provides that the Financial Covenant shall be solely for the benefit of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility such that a breach of the Financial Covenant will not constitute an event of default for purposes of the Term Loan B Facility (or any other facility, other than the New Revolving Credit Facility), and the lenders under the Term Loan B Facility or any other facility (other than the New Revolving Credit Facility) will not be permitted to exercise any remedies with respect to an uncured breach of the Financial Covenant until the date, if any, on which the commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility have been terminated or the loans thereunder have been accelerated as a result of such breach.

The obligation of the Lenders to provide the Financing is subject to a number of conditions, including, among others, (i) the consummation of the Mergers substantially contemporaneously with the initial funding of the New Senior Credit Facilities, (ii) the accuracy of certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement, as well as certain other specified representations of NewCRG that are customary for a loan facility of this type, (iii) execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Commitment Letter with respect to the New Senior Credit Facilities, (iv) delivery of certain customary closing documents (including, among others, a customary solvency certificate), specified items of collateral and certain financial statements, all as more fully described in the Commitment Letter, (v) payment of applicable fees and expenses, (vi) receipt of one or more customary confidential information memoranda to be used for syndication of the New Senior Credit Facilities and the expiration of a 15 business day period following delivery of such Confidential information memorandum, and (vii) that there has been no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) since the date of the Merger Agreement.

Registration Rights and Stockholders’ Agreement

Simultaneously with the closing of the Mergers, NewCRG and Cambridge Holdings will enter into a Registration Rights and Stockholders’ Agreement (the “Registration Rights and Stockholders’ Agreement”) pursuant to which NewCRG will agree to file one shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of at least 30% of the NewCRG Investor Shares, the shares of NewCRG Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock (the “Conversion Common Stock”) and any shares of NewCRG Common Stock issued or issuable to Cambridge Holdings with respect to the NewCRG Common Stock and the Conversion Common Stock by way of a stock dividend or stock split or in connection with a combination of shares, recapitalization, merger consolidation or other reorganization (collectively, the “Registrable Shares”) upon written request of Cambridge Holdings at any time after the BKC Registration Rights Agreement (and subject to certain rights of certain persons, including members of current and former management of Carrols Restaurant Group that have piggyback registration rights). Except as otherwise provided, the Registration Rights and Stockholders' Agreement requires NewCRG to pay for all costs and expenses, other than underwriting discounts, commissions and underwriters’ counsel fees, incurred in connection with the registration of the NewCRG Common Stock, stock transfer taxes and the expenses of Cambridge Holdings’ legal counsel in connection with the sale of the Registrable Shares, provided that NewCRG will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for Cambridge Holdings up to $50,000 in the aggregate for any registration thereunder, subject 
20

to the limitations set forth therein. NewCRG will also agree to indemnify Cambridge Holdings against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

For the period that is two years after the date of the Registration Rights and Stockholders’ Agreement, Cambridge Holdings may not, without the approval of a majority of the directors of NewCRG other than the Cambridge Directors (as defined below), directly or indirectly transfer any shares of NewCRG Series C Preferred Stock (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any such shares), NewCRG Investor Shares (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any such shares), or Conversion Common Stock (or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for any shares) held by Cambridge Holdings provided that such transfer restriction will not apply to (i) any transfer of Cambridge Holdings Shares or Conversion Common Stock yielding up to $6.0 million in gross aggregate proceeds, and (ii) transfers to certain identified affiliates of Cambridge Holdings (such affiliates, “Permitted Affiliates”).

Until the date that Cambridge Holdings and the Permitted Affiliates hold shares of NewCRG Common Stock and Conversion Common Stock constituting less than 14.5% of the total number of outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock (the “Cambridge Director Step-Down Date”), Cambridge Holdings has the right to nominate two individuals as director nominees of NewCRG, which shall initially be Matthew Perelman and Alex Sloane, and the board of directors of NewCRG (the “NewCRG Board”) will take all necessary action to support the election and appointment of such director nominees as directors of the NewCRG Board (each such director, a “Cambridge Director”). From the Cambridge Director Step-Down Date to the date that Cambridge Holdings and the Permitted Affiliates hold shares of NewCRG Common Stock and Conversion Common Stock constituting less than 10% of the total number of outstanding shares of NewCRG Common Stock (the “Cambridge Director Cessation Date”), Cambridge Holdings has the right to nominate one individual as a director nominee of NewCRG and NewCRG and the NewCRG Board will take all necessary action to support the election and appointment of such director nominee as a director of the NewCRG Board. Until the Cambridge Director Cessation Date, NewCRG and the NewCRG Board will act to ensure that the number of Cambridge Directors serving on each committee of the NewCRG Board is, to the extent possible proportional to the number of Cambridge Directors serving on the NewCRG Board and that at least one Cambridge Director serves on each of the Compensation Committee, the Finance Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the NewCRG Board at all times, provided that such Cambridge Directors meet the requirements to serve on such committee under the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Until the Cambridge Director Cessation Date, at each annual or special meeting of the NewCRG stockholders at which any person is subject to election or re-election as a member of the NewCRG Board, Cambridge Holdings has agreed to cause to be present for quorum purposes all shares of NewCRG Investor Common Stock and Conversion Common Stock that Cambridge Holdings and its Permitted Affiliates have the right to vote as of the record date for such meeting of the NewCRG stockholders, and vote or cause to be voted all such shares of NewCRG Investor Common Stock and Conversion Common Stock in favor of the election of all of the director nominees recommended for election by the NewCRG Board, and against the removal of any such director (unless proposed by NewCRG).
