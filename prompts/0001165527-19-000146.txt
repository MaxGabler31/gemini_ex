Item 1 - Business
General
 
Mansfield-Martin Exploration Mining, Inc. (“Company” or “MMEM”) was incorporated under the Laws of the State of Nevada on February 23, 2011 as SW China Imports, Inc. The Company’s initial business plan was to import high-end handmade lace wigs, hairpieces, and other beauty supplies and accessories manufactured overseas into the United States.  In June 2014, the Company changed its name to Med-Cannabis Pharma, Inc. and implemented a new business plan to enter into the retail sale of medical and personal use marijuana, where allowable.  In October 2015, the Company changed its name to MCPI, Inc.  In March 2017, the Company, in anticipation of consummating a proposed asset acquisition transaction, changed its name to Mansfield-Martin Exploration Mining, Inc.
 
A detailed discussion of the Company’s previous business plans and activities has been disclosed in predecessor filings on both Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed in prior periods.
 
On November 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement (Agreement).  Under the terms of this Agreement, the Company issued issue 284,580,000 shares of its common stock into escrow for the benefit of Armada Mining, Inc., an Arizona corporation, and/or its assigns (Armada) in exchange for rights and interests in mining properties in the historic Tombstone Mining District.  The Agreement allows for the Company to acquire rights and interests to approximately 3,800 acres of contiguous mineral leases, including some property acquired in fee simple, and ownership of 100% of Tombstone Development Company, which was formed in 1933, and is believed to be the oldest continually operating mining company in Arizona.  A copy of the Agreement was furnished as an exhibit to a Form 8-K filed on or about November 28, 2016.
 
This exchange resulted in Armada owning approximately 85% of the Company, post-transaction. Subject to financing and various regulatory approvals, the Company intends to commence development of these properties by processing previously mined materials for silver, as well as precious and base metals; by reopening and developing existing mines using modern equipment and techniques; and by completing an existing drill/test grid to establish the boundary of producible ore bodies, in anticipation of a Bankable Feasibility Study and further development.
 
The completion of the acquisition of these currently non-performing claims/leases was initially subject to the completion of due diligence, acquisition of adequate financing and various regulatory approvals.  On June 27, 2017, the Registrant announced that the due diligence process, although not totally complete, was sufficient to close the November 28, 2016 transaction.  The transaction closed as follows:
 
  
a) | The Company received from Armada 100% of the issued and outstanding stock in Tombstone Development Company, which was formed in 1933, is believed to be the oldest continually operating mining company in Arizona. This piece of the acquisition was recorded at the nominal value of approximately $1,000.

b) | The Company received an assignment from Armada of approximately 45% of a specific group of claims/leases covering approximately 200 contiguous acres, subject to a “wrap” note issued in favor of Armada approximately equal to a note payable to the original lessee of approximately $200,000. This piece of the acquisition was recorded at approximately $400,000, which equals the value of the note payable being assumed and the nominal intrinsic value of $1,000 per acre.

This piece of the transaction was recorded at approximately $1,400,000, which equals the approximate value of the note being assumed and the nominal intrinsic value of $1,000 per acre.

NOTE: in both b) and c) - Armada will retain the remaining respective 55% in each specific group of claims/leases, subject to the generation of approximately $500,000 in net earnings from the respective claims AFTER the retirement of all affiliated debt.  After the debt is retired and the $500,000 is paid to Armada, the residual 55% will transfer to the Company for no additional consideration.
 
  
d) | The Company received an assignment of 100% of approximately ten (10) specific claims/leases acquired from the Bureau of Land Management by Jack T. Bauska, personally. This piece of the acquisition was recorded at the nominal value of $2,000, which approximates the founder’s cost related to Mr. Bauska’s expenses for acquisition and recording.

e) | The Company received an assignment of 100% of certain claims/leases covering approximately 278 contiguous acres originally acquired by Jack T. Bauska, personally; subject to a 100% assumption of a note payable to the original lessee of approximately $560,000 and accrued interest of approximately $60,526. This piece of the transaction was valued at approximately $898,526, which equals the approximate value of the note being received and the nominal intrinsic value of $1,000 per acre.

f) | The Company received an assignment of 47.5% of certain claims/leases, covering approximately 2,300 contiguous acres, controlled by an affiliate of Armada. At the time the Armada affiliate receives approximately $800,000 in net proceeds from the development of the affiliated claims, the Armada affiliate will transfer the residual 52.5% to the Registrant for no additional consideration. This piece of the transaction was valued at the nominal value of approximately $2,300,000, which equals the nominal intrinsic value of $1,000 per acre.

This aggregate transaction has an approximate initial gross asset value of approximately $5,000,526 with the issuance or assumption of underlying debt to initially acquire said claims/leases of approximately $1,460,000.
 
The “wrap” note issued to Armada is for an aggregate $900,000 and bears interest at 7.0% interest.  The “wrap” note was originally due on December 31, 2018, and has been extended to December 31, 2019; it may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
 
The assumed note is in the principal amount of $560,000 and bears interest at 5.0%.  This note originally matured on August 20, 2015, is secured by a Deed of Trust on the underlying claims/leases and no notice of default or demand for payment has been made by the initial borrower.  Management is of the opinion that this note is currently in “demand” status and the underlying assets are not at risk for foreclosure.
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2017, Management evaluated the carrying value of these assets as of that date and determined that these assets are of limited value unless and until the Company arranges development capital.   Accordingly, management has provided an impairment equal to the net recorded acquisition value of these assets as of December 31, 2017.
 
On February 22, 2017, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement (MDA) with L2 Capital, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company (“L2 Capital”).  Our MDA has several components: 1) Under the Equity Purchase Agreement (‘Equity Line”), the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell shares of its common stock to L2 Capital at 75% of the prevailing OTC market price, as determined by the public market over time periods set out in the Equity Line, for up to $3,000,000 and 2) Under the Registration Rights Agreement (“Registration Rights”), the Company is obliged to register the offering of shares to be put under the Equity Line with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-1, and certain Blue Sky regulators, so that L2 Capital may, presumably, resell such shares under our Rule 424 Prospectus.
 
The Registrant paid a 3% capital commitment fee to L2 Capital, by issuing to it a $90,000 8% Convertible Promissory Note (“Note”)  The Note requires us to repay $45,000, with interest, in six (6) months, and the balance upon the effective date of the referenced Form S-1, or an additional six (6) months, whichever is earlier.  Our default would trigger conversion rights in favor of L2 Capital, permitting it to demand issuance of shares at a 30% discount to market sufficient to satisfy any amounts due.

Also included in the MDA are share reserve requirements, under which our transfer agent has agreed to maintain a portion of our authorized but unissued shares sufficient to meet our obligations under the Equity Line and Note.
 
As of December 31, 2017 and subsequent thereto, the Company is in default on this obligation and the recorded $90,000 has been charged to expense.  No demand for either conversion or redemption has been made by L2 Capital.
 
On November 20, 2017, the Company issued a press release noting it had entered into a letter of intent with Qu Ltd. to provide up to 5 million oz. silver dore to back a new crypto-currency offering.  As a result of the initial due diligence activities, management of the Company elected to discontinue this relationship and has no ongoing involvement or commitment to this endeavor.
