ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Business development
 
Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. (the “Company”, “we” or “Liberty Star”) was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. (“Titanium”). Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004, we commenced operations in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. In April 2007, we changed our name to Liberty Star Uranium & Metals Corp. Hay Mountain Super Project LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, serves as the primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area of interest in Arizona. Prior to 2017 Big Chunk Corp. (“Big Chunk”), our wholly owned subsidiary, was engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business in the State of Alaska. We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations.
 
Our current business
 
We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the States of Arizona and the Southwest USA. Claims in the State of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty Star. We use the term “Super Project” to indicate a project in which numerous mineral targets have been identified, any one or more of which could potentially contain commercially viable quantities of minerals. Our significant projects are described below.
 
North Pipes Super Project (“North Pipes” and “NPSP”): The NPSP is located in Northern Arizona on the Arizona Strip. We plan to ascertain whether the NPSP claims possess commercially viable deposits of uranium and associated co-product metals. We have not identified any ore reserves to date.
 
Big Chunk Super Project: The Big Chunk Super Project located in the Iliamna region of Southwestern Alaska. After much caution and thought, we have decided to no longer put any funds into Big Chunk due to the current decision making of the Environmental Protection Agency. We have not identified any ore reserves to date.


Tombstone Super Project (“Tombstone”) (formerly referred to as Tombstone Porphyry Precious Metals Project): Tombstone is located in Cochise County, Arizona and covers the Tombstone caldera and its environs. Within the Tombstone caldera is the Hay Mountain target where we are concentrating our work at this time. We plan to ascertain whether the Tombstone, Hay Mountain claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese and other metals including Rare Earth Elements (REE’s). We have not identified any ore reserves to date.
 
East Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project (“East Silver Bell”): East Silver Bell is located northwest of Tucson, Arizona. We plan to ascertain whether the East Silver Bell claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper. We have not identified any ore reserves to date.
 
Title to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We have investigated title to all the Company’s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties retained are in good standing.
 
The mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies that are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities and are engaged in exploring land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantities and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction of a known mineral resource are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities.

There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required before we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources. Even if we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit will constitute a commercially viable mineral deposit, known as an “ore reserve.”
 
To date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability to obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so.
 
Competition
 
We are a mineral resource company engaged in the business of mineral exploration. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral resource exploration companies. The presence of competing mineral resource exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our property acquisitions and exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors.
 
We also compete for mineral properties of merit with other exploration companies. Competition could reduce the availability of properties of merit or increase the cost of acquiring additional mineral properties.
 
Many of the resource exploration companies with whom we compete may have greater financial and technical resources than we have. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of properties of merit and on exploration of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of resource properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and to senior exploration companies that may purchase resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further exploration.
 
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the States of Arizona and Alaska.
 
Our North Pipes claims are federal lode mining claims located on U.S. federal lands and administered by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”). In 2012, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior withdrew federal lands from locatable mineral exploration and mining North of the Grand Canyon along the Utah border in Arizona, the so-called “Arizona Strip,” for 20 years. Nearly 1 million acres of land managed by the BLM and the Forest Service are subject to the moratorium. However, the moratorium permits existing claims and mines to continue as before, including our North Pipes lode mining claims. 
 
We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for the North Pipes project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1st through the following September 1st and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rentals are $155 per claim. The rentals of $1,705 for the period from September 1, 2017 to September 1, 2018 have been paid. The rentals due by September 1, 2018 for the period from September 1, 2018 through September 1, 2019 of $1,705 have not been paid yet, however, we plan to pay these fees prior to the due date.


We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for our East Silverbell project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1st through the following September 1st and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rental is $155 per claim. The rentals of $4,030 for the period from September 1, 2017 to September 1, 2018 have been paid. The annual rentals due by September 1, 2018 of $4,030 are required to maintain the East Silverbell claims are for the period from September 1, 2018 through September 1, 2019 have not been paid yet, however, we plan to pay these fees prior to the due date. There is no requirement for annual assessment or exploration work on the federal lode mining claims. There are no royalties associated with the federal lode mining claims.

We are required to pay annual rentals for our Arizona State Land Department Mineral Exploration Permits (“AZ MEP”) at our Tombstone Hay Mountain project in the State of Arizona. AZ MEP permits are valid for 1 year and renewable for up to 5 years. The rental fee is $2.00 per acre for the first year, which includes the second year, and $1.00 per acre per year for years three through five. The minimum work expenditure requirements are $10 per acre per year for years one and two and $20 per acre per year for years three through five. If the minimum work expenditure requirement is not met the applicant can pay the equal amount in fees to the Arizona State Land Department to keep the AZ MEP permits current. The rental period begins on September 30th through the following September 29th for our Hay Mountain permits. Rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. We hold AZ MEP permits for 2,966.88 acres at our Tombstone project. We plan to pay rental fees for our AZ MEP’s before September 29, 2018 in the amount of $3,500. Required minimum work expenditures for the period ending September 29, 2018 is $29,668.
 
With respect to the foregoing properties, additional approvals and authorizations may be required from other government agencies, depending upon the nature and scope of the proposed exploration program. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the size, quality of any resource or reserve at this time, and it is extremely difficult to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position.
 
Personnel
 
Currently we employ one full time geologist who is also our CEO, CFO, President and Chairman of the Board, James A. Briscoe. We also employ one full time VP for management of finance and accounting, one full time geo-tech, who is also our manager of field operations, and one investor relations representative and one CPA on an as needed basis. We hire consultants for investor relations, exploration, derivative accounting, and administrative functions also on an as needed basis.
