Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a growth-oriented and technology-focused oilfield service company focused exclusively on hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas exploration and production (“E&P”) companies in the United States. We are one of the first companies to develop and commercially deploy electric powered hydraulic fracturing technology, which we believe is an industry changing technology. Currently, we provide our services in the Appalachian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and the Permian Basin. We have demonstrated the capability to expeditiously deploy our fleets to new oil and gas basins when requested by customers. Our customers include Antero Resources, Apache, Conoco, CNX, Encana Corp, Hawkwood, Marathon, Shell, Southwestern Energy and other leading E&P companies.
Company Formation
 On February 21, 2012, U.S. Well Services, LLC (“USWS LLC”) was formed as a Delaware limited liability company. This Houston, Texas-based oilfield service provider grew organically from one diesel powered hydraulic fracturing fleet (“Conventional Fleets”) in April 2012 to 11 currently active fleets representing 550,000 hydraulic horsepower (“HHP”); two of which utilize our patented electric hydraulic fracturing technology (“Clean Fleets”). We currently have two new-build fleets which will be deployed during the first half of 2019 bringing our total fleet count to 13 and representing 630,000 HHP. 
 Due to a severe and prolonged industry downturn, USWS LLC completed an out-of-court restructuring (the “Restructuring”) in February 2017. The Restructuring resulted in the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of all of the outstanding equity interest of USWS LLC (“Predecessor”) by newly-formed entity, USWS Holdings, LLC (“Successor” or “USWS Holdings”), a Delaware limited liability company formed for the purposes of effecting the Acquisition and had no operations of its own. The Restructuring was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. USWS Holdings subsequently merged into US Well Services, Inc. (f/k/a Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation) on November 9, 2018, discussed further under Business Combination herein. 
 Business Combination
 On March 10, 2016, Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation was originally incorporated in Delaware as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On March 15, 2017, Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”), following which its shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).
 On November 9, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation acquired USWS Holdings pursuant to a Merger and Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 13, 2018, and subsequently amended (as amended, the “Merger and Contribution Agreement” or the “Transaction”). The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Under this method of accounting, USWS Holdings is treated as the acquirer and Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation is treated as the acquired party.
 Pursuant to the Merger and Contribution Agreement, on the Closing Date, US Well Services, Inc. issued Class A common stock to certain members of USWS Holdings in exchange for their interests in USWS Holdings and Class B common stock to certain members of USWS Holdings who retained their interests in USWS Holdings.  
 Following the completion of the Transaction, the Company was organized as an “Up-C” structure, meaning that substantially all of the Company’s assets and operations are held and conducted by USWS LLC, and the Company’s only assets are equity interests representing 77.9% ownership of USWS Holdings as of December 31, 2018.
 In connection with the closing of the Transaction, Matlin & Partners Acquisition Corporation changed its name 
 4
 

to “US Well Services, Inc.” (herein referred to as the “Company”, “USWS Inc.” or ‘Registrant”) and its trading symbols on Nasdaq from “MPAC,” and “MPACW,” to “USWS” and “USWSW”.
 Organizational Structure
 The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of the Company as of December 31, 2018: 
 

Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights to USWS Inc., but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by shareholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law. We do not intend to list Class B common stock on any exchange.
 Under the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of USWS Holdings, LLC, each share of Class B common stock, together with one unit of USWS Holdings and subject to certain limitation, is exchangeable (the "Exchange Right") for one share of Class A common stock or, at the Company's election, the cash equivalent to the market value of one share of Class A common stock.  The exchange is subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends, reclassifications and other similar transactions.  In addition, upon a change in control of USWS Inc., USWS Inc. has the right to require each holder of USWS Holdings units (other than USWS Inc.) to exercise its Exchange Right with respect to some or all of such holder's USWS Holdings units.  An exchange of Class B common stock, together with the corresponding one unit of USWS Holdings member unit will result in both being cancelled.
 Operations 
 Our operations are organized into a single business segment, which consists of hydraulic fracturing services, and we have one reportable geographical business segment, the United States. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer, for periods prior to the completion of the Business Combination, to USWS Holdings and its subsidiaries and, for periods upon or after the completion of the Business Combination, to US Well Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including USWS

Holdings and its subsidiaries. 
 Services
 We provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies. Hydraulic fracturing services are performed to enhance production of oil and natural gas from formations with low permeability and restricted flow of hydrocarbons. Our customers benefit from our expertise in fracturing of horizontal and vertical oil- and natural gas-producing wells in shale and other unconventional geological formations.
 The process of hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a pressurized stream of fracturing fluid — typically a mixture of water, chemicals and proppant — into a well casing or tubing in order to cause the underground mineral formation to fracture or crack. Fractures release trapped hydrocarbon particles and provide a conductive channel for the oil or natural gas to flow freely to the wellbore for collection. The propping agent, or proppant, becomes lodged in the cracks created by the hydraulic fracturing process, “propping” them open to facilitate the flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the well. 
 Our fleets consist of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary heavy equipment to perform fracturing services. We have two designs for our hydraulic fracturing units: (1) our Conventional Fleets, which utilize traditional internal combustion engines, transmissions, radiators and are powered by diesel fuel and (2) our Clean Fleets which replace the traditional engines, transmissions, and radiators with electric motors powered by electricity generated by natural gas fueled turbine generators. Both designs utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps mounted on trailers. We refer to the group of pump trailers and other equipment necessary to perform a typical fracturing job as a “fleet,” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.”
Clean Fleets Technology
 Our Clean Fleets combine natural gas turbine generators with electric motors and existing industry equipment to provide fracturing services with numerous advantages over conventional fleets. Our Clean Fleets technology is a proven technology that has been in commercial operations since July 2014, making us a leading provider of electric-powered hydraulic fracturing services. Our Clean Fleets technology is supported by a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have been granted, or have received notice of allowance, for 18 patents and have an additional 75 patents pending.
 We believe Clean Fleets provide the Company with a distinct competitive advantage over our competitors because of the following characteristics:
  
• | Environmental benefits. Clean Fleets can substantially reduce emissions of air pollutants as compared to conventional fleets, reducing the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fuel cost savings. The use of natural gas directly from the field allows our Clean Fleets to eliminate diesel fuel costs including cost of delivery to wellsite, providing significant fuel cost savings versus a conventional diesel-powered fleet.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved operational efficiency. The elimination of diesel delivery results in simpler logistics, reduced truck traffic and congestion on location and in the community. The reduction of routine maintenance services (e.g., oil changes) along with the inherent stability of the electric system maximizes productive time at the wellsite, allowing our Clean Fleets to pump more hours per day versus a conventional diesel-powered fleet, resulting in fewer days on location. In addition to the cost of the completion crew, our customers incur significant costs for ancillary equipment and service providers each day on site. The reduction in days on site creates additional economic benefit to our customers by reducing these costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced repair and maintenance cost. Clean Fleets eliminate the use of diesel engines and transmissions, which require on-going maintenance in the form of routine oil and filter changes, component replacements and eventual rebuilds. In addition to having a materially longer rebuild cycle, the cost to rebuild an electric motor is significantly less than the cost to rebuild a conventional engine, transmission and radiator.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Longer equipment useful life. Natural gas-powered generators are proven, long-lived assets that have operated in harsh environments for decades. In conjunction with the turbine generators, Clean Fleets use electric motors that have fewer mechanical parts relative to the conventional diesel-powered engines and transmissions. Similar to the generators, these electric motors have been in use in other heavy-duty industrial applications for decades with a demonstrated useful life of more than 20 years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduced noise pollution. Clean Fleets offer a dramatic reduction in sound pressure and low frequency noise as compared to conventional fracturing fleets, which benefits the surrounding communities and improves work-site conditions for our employees and customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced safety features. Clean Fleets reduce heat and noise emissions, making the wellsite safer for our employees and all personnel at the wellsite. Additionally, by eliminating diesel truck deliveries, Clean Fleets decrease the danger from refueling operations, reduces traffic in the communities in which we operate and limits wellsite crowding.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following strengths will position us to provide high-quality service to our customers and create value for our stockholders:
  
• | Proprietary Clean Fleets technology. We are a market leader in electric fracturing technology, with two active all-electric hydraulic fracturing fleets and two under construction. Our Clean Fleets provide substantial cost savings by replacing diesel fuel with natural gas and offer considerable operational, safety and environmental advantages. Clean Fleets offer superior operational efficiency resulting from reduced non-productive time due to repairs, maintenance and failures associated with diesel-powered engines and transmissions. Additionally, Clean Fleets can substantially reduce emissions of air pollutants and noise from the wellsite. We believe that adoption of this technology in the near term will materially increase and allow us to continue to significantly expand our market share over the next several years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong customer relationships supported by contracts. We have cultivated strong relationships with a diverse group of blue-chip customers as a result of the quality of our service, safety performance and ability to work with customers to establish mutually beneficial service agreements. Our contracts provide customers with certainty of service pricing, allowing them to efficiently budget and plan the development of their wells. Additionally, our contracts allow us to maintain high utilization of our fleet and generate revenue and cash flow through industry cycles. We believe our relationships and the structure of our contracts position us to continue to build long-term partnerships with customers and support stable financial performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modern, high-quality equipment and rigorous maintenance program. Our hydraulic fracturing fleets consist of modern, well-maintained equipment. We invest in high-quality equipment from leading original equipment manufacturers and use all stainless-steel fluid ends. Moreover, we take proactive measures to maintain the quality of our equipment, using specialized equipment to monitor frac pump integrity and our proprietary FRAC MD® data analytics platform to support preventative maintenance efforts. We believe the quality of our equipment is critical to our ability to provide high quality service to our customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong, employee-centered culture. Our employees are critical to our success and are a key source of our competitive advantage. We continuously invest in training and development for our employees, and as a result, we are able to provide consistent, high-quality service and safe working conditions for both employees and customers. During the recent industry downturn, we maintained higher levels of utilization and were able to operate without making significant reductions in force. In the current operating environment, our well-trained, highly capable employees have expanded with us, helping to crew fleets in new markets, which has ensured a consistent culture and the high quality of service for which we are known.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Track record for safety. Safety is a critical element of our operations. We focus on providing customers with the highest quality of service by employing a trained and motivated workforce that is rigorously focused on safety. We continuously review safety data and work to develop and implement policies and procedures that ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. Our field operators are empowered to stop work and question the safety of a situation or task performed. We use specialized technology to improve safety for our truck drivers, and employ measures to mitigate the risk of respirable silica dust exposure on the wellsite. We believe our record of safe operations makes us an attractive partner for both our customers and our employees.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proven, cycle-tested management team. Our management team has a proven track record for building and operating oilfield service companies. As a result of our strategy, we have grown the business organically. Our operating and commercial teams have significant industry experience and longstanding relationships with our clients. We believe our management team’s experience and relationships position us to generate business and create value for stockholders.

Customer Concentration
 Our customers include a broad range of leading E&P companies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Antero Resources, Southwestern Energy, Hawkwood Energy, Wildhorse Resource Development, and CNX Resources each comprised greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
Suppliers
 We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts and components that are manufactured and supplied for our operations. We currently rely on a limited number of suppliers from which we procure major equipment components used to maintain, build or upgrade our custom Clean Fleets hydraulic fracturing equipment.  In addition, some of these components have few suppliers and long lead times to acquire. Historically, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or equipment by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Competition
 The markets in which we operate are very competitive. We provide services in various geographic regions across the United States, and our competitors include many large and small oilfield service providers, including some of the largest integrated service companies. Our hydraulic fracturing services compete with large, integrated companies such as Halliburton Company and Schlumberger Limited as well as other companies including Basic Energy Services, Inc., BJ Services Company, C&J Energy Services, Inc., Calfrac Well Services Ltd., FTS International, Inc., Keane Group, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services, Inc. Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc., ProPetro Services, Inc., RPC, Inc., and Superior Energy Services, Inc. In addition, our industry is highly fragmented and we compete regionally with a significant number of smaller service providers.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are technical expertise, equipment capacity, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. 
 Cyclical Nature of Industry
 We operate in a cyclical industry. The key factor driving demand for our services is the level of well completions by E&P companies, which in turn depends largely on the current and anticipated economics of new well completions. Global supply and demand for oil and the domestic supply and demand for natural gas are critical in assessing industry outlook. Demand for oil and natural gas is cyclical and subject to large, rapid fluctuations. E&P companies tend to increase capital expenditures in response to increases in oil and natural gas prices, which generally results in greater revenues and profits for oilfield service companies like us.

Increased E&P capital expenditures ultimately lead to greater production, which historically has resulted in increased supplies and reduced prices which in turn tend to reduce demand for oilfield services. For these reasons, the results of our operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and these fluctuations may distort comparisons of results across periods.
 Seasonality
 Historically, our results of operations have not been significantly affected by seasonality. However, inclement weather, the capital expenditure cycles of our customers, and holidays can impact our operating results.
 Insurance
 Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of their applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in permit revocations or modifications, operational disruptions, or injunctive obligations for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically-sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes in the laws or regulations or the interpretation thereof that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future.
 Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and comparable state laws and regulations, which affect their activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with our own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of nonhazardous waste provisions.
 Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of nonhazardous wastes or re-categorize some nonhazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous 
 9
 

wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing their wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase their costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or “Superfund”) and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released.
 NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) associated with oil and gas deposits and accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
 Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”), or the state. The Clean Water Act has been interpreted by these agencies to apply broadly. The EPA and the Corps released a rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. In January 2017, the United States Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or appellate courts. In January 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the rule. EPA has instituted rulemakings to both delay the effective date of this rule and repeal the rule.  Federal district court decisions have preserved the stay in a majority of states, which remain subject to pre-2015 regulated waters regulations.  Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing.  More recently, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the Corps released a proposal to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule so as to narrow the regulatory definition of waters of the United States, with a 60-day comment period to follow. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
 Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
 Climate Change. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gasses (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to 
 10
 

public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. And in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. On June 1, 2017, the United States President announced that the U.S. planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020.
 Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
 Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
 
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. However, in June 2017, the EPA proposed a two year stay of the fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, pneumatic pump standards, and closed vent system certification requirements in the 2016 New Source Performance Standards rule for the oil and gas industry while it reconsiders these aspects of the rule. On September 11, 2018, the EPA proposed targeted improvements to the rule, including amendments to the rule’s fugitive emissions monitoring requirements, and expects to “significantly reduce” the regulatory burden of the rule in doing so. The U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized similar rules in November 2016 that limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and natural gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements. The BLM adopted final rules in January 2017. Operators generally had one year from the January 2017 effective date to come into compliance with the rule’s requirements. In December 2017, the BLM temporarily suspended or delayed certain of these requirements set forth in its Venting and Flaring Rule until January 2019, and in September 2018 BLM proposed a revised rule which scaled back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule.  Environmental groups sued in federal district court a day later to challenge the legality of aspects of the revised rule, and the outcome of this litigation is currently uncertain.  Moreover, in March 2015, the Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a final rule that imposes requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water. However, BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017. In January 2018, California and a coalition of environmental groups filed suit in the Northern District of California 
 11
 

to challenge BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule. This litigation is ongoing and future implementation of the rule is uncertain at this time. 
 Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. 
 More recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead the federal government and has led some state governments to develop and implement additional regulations, including stricter regulatory requirements relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells or requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise.
 Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities (whether as a result of the EPA study results or resulting from other factors) could subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers and reduce the demand for our services.
 OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 856 full-time employees and no part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We believe our relationships with our employees are excellent. From time to time, we will utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and/or other services.
 Intellectual Property
 We have been granted or have received notice of allowance for 18 patents, which begin to expire in late 2033, and have an additional 75 patents pending. Our patents protect our Clean Fleets from being duplicated by competitors. These patents help provide unique competitive advantages in operating areas where noise and emissions are key concerns. We also use proprietary FRAC MD® technology to support our preventative maintenance program and prolong equipment useful life. This technology utilizes specialized equipment to capture and analyze vibrations in order to identify component stress so maintenance can be performed prior to catastrophic failures.
Availability of Information
 We file or furnish annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains an internet website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC.

We also make available free of charge through our website, www.uswellservices.com, electronic copies of certain documents that we file with the SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Information on our website or any other website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report.
