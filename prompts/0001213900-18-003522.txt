Overview
 
We are an emerging bionutrition and biotherapeutics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of products that improve muscle health and function essential to the management of sarcopenia, cachexia and degenerative muscle diseases, and as an adjunct to the treatment of obesity. As used in this report, the “Company”, “MYOS”, “our”, or “we” refers to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2007. On March 17, 2016, we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary and changed our name from MYOS Corporation to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. Prior to February 2011, we did not have any operations and did not generate revenues. In February 2011, we entered into an intellectual property purchase agreement pursuant to which our subsidiary purchased from Peak Wellness, Inc., or Peak, the intellectual property pertaining to Fortetropin®, a dietary supplement that has been shown in clinical studies to temporarily decrease the levels of serum myostatin, MYO-T12, a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin®, certain trademarks, trade secrets, patent applications and certain domain names.
 
Since February 2011, our principal business activities have been to: (i) deepen our scientific understanding of the activity of Fortetropin®, which refers to a proprietary proteo-lipid composition derived from fertilized eggs of specific chicken species processed using a patented methodology which preserves the bioactivity of the constituent proteins and lipids, specifically as a natural, reversible, temporary reducing agent of myostatin, and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen and build our intellectual property; (ii) conduct research and development activities to evaluate myostatin modulation in a range of both wellness and disease states; (iii) identify other products and technologies which may broaden our portfolio and define a business development strategy to protect, enhance and accelerate the growth of our products; (iv) reduce the cost of manufacturing through process improvement; (v) identify contract manufacturing organizations that can fully meet our future growth requirements; (vi) develop a differentiated and advantaged consumer positioning, brand name and iconography; and, (vii) create sales and marketing capabilities to maximize near-term and future revenues.
 
We believe that existing wellness and therapeutic targets, such as myostatin, represent a rational entry point for additional drug discovery efforts and are evaluating a separate, concurrent objective in this area. We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. We expect to continue developing our own core branded products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehabilitation and restorative health and to pursue international sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products.
 
Our executive offices are currently located at 45 Horsehill Road, Suite 106, Cedar Knolls, New Jersey 07927 and our telephone number is (973) 509-0444. Our corporate website address is http://www.myosrens.com and our new muscle health education and product website is http://www.qurr.com.

General 
 
Following our purchase of Fortetropin® in February 2011, we have been focusing on the discovery, development, and commercialization of nutritional ingredients, functional foods, therapeutic products, and other technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. Our officers, directors and members of our Scientific Advisory Board, including Dr. Robert Hariri, Dr. Louis Aronne, Dr. Neilank Jha and Dr. Caroline Apovian, have significant research and development experience.
 
Fortetropin® is the Company’s proprietary all-natural food ingredient clinically shown to increase muscle size, lean body mass and strength as part of resistance training.  Fortetropin® is made from fertilized chicken egg yolks using a proprietary process that retains the biological integrity and bioactivity of the product.  In an animal study, Fortetropin® was shown to up-regulate muscle building pathways and down-regulate muscle degrading pathways. While Fortetropin® is our first proprietary ingredient, we plan to discover, develop, formulate and/or acquire additional products in the future.
 
We are developing nutritional and therapeutic products aimed at maintaining and improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. Our research is focused on developing strategies and therapeutic interventions to address muscle related conditions including sarcopenia, cachexia, and inherited and acquired muscle diseases as described in more detail below.
 

● | Sarcopenia is a degenerative process characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass with advancing age. The loss of muscle affects all individuals regardless of ethnicity or gender although the rate and degree of muscle loss varies between individuals and is affected by many factors. Those individuals who have lost significant amounts of muscle mass and strength often require assistance for accomplishing daily living activities, which has a significant economic burden on a nation’s healthcare system and impacts the overall economy. In addition to the many direct costs, sarcopenia adversely affects the overall quality of life. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in many diseases such as cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic kidney failure and AIDS. It is characterized by a significant loss of body weight as a consequence of pathological changes in different metabolic pathways, with the loss of muscle mass as the core component of the syndrome. Cachexia leads to a poor quality of life and increased mortality. As skeletal muscle is diminished, individuals experience a reduced ability to move, a loss of strength, and an increase in conditions associated with immobility such as thrombosis, pneumonia, respiratory failure and ultimately death. Weight loss is an important prognosticator in cancer therapy with the greater the weight loss, generally the shorter the survival time. Weight loss in cancer patients due to cachexia arises from the loss of both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Inherited and acquired muscle diseases, such as muscular dystrophy and muscle dysfunction that occur as a consequence of denervation such as seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are conditions marked by the progressive deterioration of muscle tissue that results in weakness and impairs normal function. These diseases are typified by difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination with many such diseases affecting speech, swallowing, and breathing. There are currently very few treatment options for most degenerative muscle diseases.

Myostatin 
 
Myostatin, which is a natural regulatory protein, plays a central role in skeletal muscle health. Interest in myostatin continues to grow within the medical community. Research on animals and humans with genetic deficiency for producing myostatin have shown an increased muscle mass, suggesting that myostatin is responsible for down-regulating muscle growth and development.
 
A 1997 article in the journal Nature first described the discovery of a novel member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth and differentiation factors. This factor was expressed specifically in adult skeletal muscle and referred to as growth/differentiation factor-8 (GDF-8) (McPherron et al., 1997). The researchers created “knockout” mice, whereby they disrupted the expression of GDF-8 throughout the organism, with the resulting mice showing a large and widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass. Individual muscles of mutant animals weighted 2-3 times more than those of wild-type animals, with the increase a result of both muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The newly created mice were subsequently named “mighty mice”. Based on the phenotype, the researchers dubbed the newly discovered protein myostatin.
 


This work suggests myostatin exerts an effect on both muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, as myostatin knock-out “mighty mice” were shown to have an increase in both the number of muscle fibers and in fiber sizes. Hypertrophy refers to the enlargement of a tissue or organ due to the enlargement of its component cells. In contrast, hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of cells or a proliferation of cells. Both of these processes can lead to enlargement of an organ.
 
Skeletal muscle is the primary producer of myostatin, where it is secreted into the blood stream and acts as a negative regulator of muscle differentiation and growth. The protein begins as a 375 amino acid dimer that is cleaved by proteases to a 109 amino acid active domain. The active form of the protein binds to activin type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB (Lee et al., 2001). Binding to the receptors initiates a signaling cascade that results in an increase in protein breakdown and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis.

Clinical Research to Evaluate Effects of Fortetropin®
 
In March 2013, we completed a human clinical trial which demonstrated the beneficial effects of Fortetropin® in suppressing free serum myostatin levels. In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, single dose study involving 12 healthy adult male subjects per arm, test subjects in the active arm were administered a 6.6 gram dose of Fortetropin® mixed with vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding. An equal amount of vanilla fat free/sugar free pudding alone was given to the placebo arm. Blood samples were collected at baseline (before dosing) and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post dose intervals for measurement of myostatin blood concentration. Results demonstrated greater than 30% decrease in serum myostatin levels compared to baseline during the 24 hour period. No study related adverse events were reported during this study.
 


In another study performed on our behalf at the University of Tampa, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examined the effects of Fortetropin® on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained individuals who rely heavily on satellite cell activation. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6 gram and 19.8 gram dosing arms of Fortetropin® daily for a period of 12 weeks. All exercise sessions were conducted and monitored by trained personnel. Standardized diets consisted of roughly 54% carbohydrates, 22% fat and 24% protein. There were no differences in total calories and macronutrients between groups. Dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was utilized to measure lean body mass and fat mass. Direct ultrasound measurements determined muscle thickness of the quadriceps.
 
Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin® but not in subjects taking a placebo. Strength and power endpoints, as measured by bench press, leg press and Wingate power, significantly increased from baseline in all study groups. No study related adverse events were reported during the study.

Association between Muscular Strength and Mortality
 
In a clinical study at the Karolinska Institutet’s Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Unit for Preventive Nutrition, in Huddinge, Sweden, 8,762 men aged 20-80 were evaluated over an average period of 18.9 years in a prospective cohort study to measure the association between muscular strength and mortality in men. After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, the study found that muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with deaths from all causes and cancer in men. The findings were valid for men of normal weight, those who were overweight, and younger or older men, and were valid even after adjusting for several potential confounders, including cardiorespiratory fitness. This study extends previous studies that showed the importance of muscular strength as a predictor of death from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in a large cohort of men. Several prospective studies have also shown that muscular strength is inversely associated with all-cause mortality. These data suggests that muscular strength adds to the protective effect of cardiorespiratory fitness against the risk of death in men. Moreover, it might be possible to reduce all-cause mortality among men by promoting regular resistance training.

Clinical and Basic Research Programs
 
We invest in research and development activities externally through academic and industry collaborations aimed at enhancing our products, optimizing manufacturing and broadening the product portfolio. We have developed the following collaborations with various academic centers:

● | In March 2018, we entered into a research agreement with Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, to work with Rutgers researchers in a program focused on discovering compounds and products for improving muscle health and performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In December 2017, we entered into an agreement with the University of California, Berkeley’s Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology. The research project will study the effects of Fortetropin® on increasing the fractional rate of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in men and women between 60 and 75 years old. The Principal Investigator for this clinical study is William J. Evans, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Human Nutrition at the Department of Nutritional Sciences & Toxicology at the University of California, Berkeley campus. Professor Evans, a leading authority in muscle health research, will coordinate the activities of a multi-disciplinary team of scientists and physicians. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 20 subjects, men and women 60 – 75 years of age, will consume either Fortetropin® or a placebo for 21 days along with daily doses of a heavy water tracer. After 21 days, a micro-biopsy will be collected from each subject to determine the fractional rate of muscle protein synthesis. MYOS anticipates the clinical study will be completed and its results announced in the second half of 2018.

● | In April 2017, we entered into an agreement with the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University to study the impact of Fortetropin® on reducing muscle atrophy in dogs after tibial-plateau-leveling osteotomy (TPLO) surgery to repair the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). The study is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2015, we initiated a dose response clinical study led by Jacob Wilson, Ph.D., CSCS*D, Professor of Health Sciences and Human Performance at the University of Tampa, to examine the effects of Fortetropin® supplementation on plasma myostatin levels at various dosing levels in young adult males and females. This study is intended to help us better define the dose response curve, the minimal effective dose and effects of Fortetropin® on serum myostatin. In this double blind placebo controlled clinical study, 80 male and female subjects ranging in ages between 18 and 22 were randomized into four groups such that no significant differences in serum myostatin concentration existed between groups. Following assignment to one of the four groups, blood samples were collected to establish baseline values. Subjects were subsequently supplemented with three different doses of Fortetropin® (2.0g, 4.0g and 6.6g) and a matching placebo for one week. Following one week of supplementation, blood samples were collected and serum myostatin levels were assayed. Results demonstrated that Fortetropin® is effective as a myostatin reducing agent at daily doses of 4.0g and 6.6g. This research, which continues to build upon our current understanding of Fortetropin®, may result in the formulation of new products. An abstract of this study was presented at the 2016 International Conference on Frailty & Sarcopenia Research (Philadelphia, PA) in April 2016.

● | In August 2014, we entered into a research agreement with Human Metabolome Technologies America, Inc., (“HMT”), to apply their proprietary, state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technologies to characterize the metabolomic profiles of plasma samples obtained from healthy male subjects who used either Fortetropin® or placebo with the goal of identifying metabolites with pro-myogenic activity in the plasma samples of subjects who took Fortetropin® as well as examining the effect on glucose and fat metabolism. HMT used a metabolite database of over 290 lipids and over 900 metabolites to identify potential plasma biomarkers of muscle growth. The study was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014. Initial data from this study indicated that subjects who received Fortetropin® displayed differential metabolomic profiles relative to subjects who received placebo. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the mechanism of action of Fortetropin® and provides guidance for the development of biotherapeutics based on Fortetropin®. Additionally, the early indications of plasma biomarkers may guide future study design for Fortetropin® clinical trials by identifying clinically-relevant endpoints and potential stratification of patient populations. The results from this study were presented at the Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders Conference (Berlin, Germany) in December 2016.

● | In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with the University of Tampa to study the effects of Fortetropin® supplementation in conjunction with modest resistance training in18-21 year old males. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which examined the effects of Fortetropin® on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally trained males. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6g and 19.8g dosing arms of Fortetropin® daily for a period of 12 weeks. Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin® but not in subjects taking placebo. The clinical study also analyzed blood myostatin and cytokines levels via high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) based analysis. Serum was analyzed for a plethora of relative cytokine levels via high-sensitivity enhanced chemiluminescent-based methods. The Interferon-Gamma (“IFN-γ”) inflammatory cytokine protocol screening showed no statistically significant changes in serum levels of IFN-γ for subjects in the placebo group. However, subjects in both Fortetropin® daily dosing arms experienced statistically significant decreases (p < 0.05) in serum levels of the IFN-γ inflammatory cytokine. IFN-γ is recognized as a signature pro-inflammatory cytokine protein that plays a central role in inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Excess levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with muscle-wasting diseases such as sarcopenia and cachexia. The lipid serum safety protocol demonstrated that daily use of Fortetropin® at recommended and three times the recommended dose had no adverse lipid effect and did not adversely affect cholesterol, HDL or triglyceride levels. Data from the study was presented at the American College of Nutrition’s 55th annual conference. A separate mechanism of action study at the University of Tampa demonstrated that in addition to reducing serum myostatin levels, Fortetropin® showed activity in mTOR and Ubiquitin pathways, two other crucial signaling pathways in the growth and maintenance of healthy muscle. Specifically, the preclinical data showed that Fortetropin® up-regulates the mTOR regulatory pathway. The mTOR pathway is responsible for production of a protein kinase related to cell growth and proliferation that increases skeletal muscle mass. Up-regulation of the mTOR pathway is important in preventing muscle atrophy. We believe Fortetropin®’s ability to affect the mTOR pathway may have a significant impact in treating patients suffering from degenerative muscle diseases and suggests that Fortetropin®-based products may help slow muscle loss secondary to immobility and denervation. The preclinical data also demonstrated that Fortetropin® acts to reduce the synthesis of proteins in the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway, a highly selective, tightly regulated system that serves to activate muscle breakdown. Over-expression of the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway is responsible for muscle degradation. We believe Fortetropin®’s ability to regulate production in the Ubiquitin Proteasome Pathway may have significant implications for repairing age-related muscle loss and for patients suffering from chronic diseases such as cachexia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In May 2014, we entered into a three-year master service agreement with Rutgers University. The initial phase under the agreement was to develop cell-based assays for high-throughput screening studies of next generation myostatin inhibitors. Additionally, we initiated a second phase of the agreement to develop a secondary assay for measuring myostatin activity using a genetically engineered muscle cell line that fluoresce in the presence of myostatin. Phase I and II were completed in 2015. We believe the assays developed will enable us to elucidate the specific molecules in Fortetropin® that impart activity as it relates to the development of muscle tissue. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The foregoing agreements are an integral part of our business strategy and we believe they will provide a clear scientific rationale for Fortetropin®’s role as an advanced nutritional product and support its use in different medical and health applications in the future.
 
We are also building a small molecule and biologics discovery program aimed at regulators of myostatin synthesis and activation and the different pathways that act upon muscle development. In July 2014, we entered into a research and development agreement with Cloud Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (“Cloud”), to discover product candidates related to the inhibition of targets in the myostatin regulatory pathway as well as inflammatory mediators associated with sarcopenia and cachexia. Cloud utilizes cloud computing technology to identify and design small molecule drug candidates based on their proprietary Inverse Design drug discovery platform. The research is focusing on the development of product candidates related to the myostatin pathway. Cloud has identified several peptides that may have myostatin inhibition properties based on computational modeling. We intend to evaluate the physiological activity of these peptides on myostatin.
 
We intend to pursue additional clinical studies and medical research to support differentiated and advantaged marketing claims, to build and enhance our competitive insulation through an aggressive intellectual property strategy, to develop product improvements and new products in consumer preferred dosage forms, to enhance overall marketing, to establish a scientific foundation for therapeutic applications for our technology, and to pursue best in class personnel.
 
Market Overview 
 
According to the Natural Marketing Institute, the Dietary Supplement, Functional Food and Beverage, and Natural Personal Care markets represent more than $250 billion in annual worldwide sales. The global market for functional foods alone in 2017 was worth an estimated $54 billion. In 2018, it is expected to continue to grow and the United States is expected to be the fastest growing market for functional foods. The global sports nutrition market was valued at $30.7 billion in 2017, and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.1% during the period from 2018 to 2022 up to $45 billion. We believe our proprietary ingredient, Fortetropin®, which is the only clinically proven natural supplement available in the market that temporarily reduces free serum myostatin level, is well-positioned to market to a wide base of consumers looking for nutritional and performance maximization as well as for wellness and maintenance products as they age. Additionally, the medical community has increased its focus on muscle health, specifically focusing on the aging U.S. population that can benefit most from myostatin modulation.
 
We believe the combination of the foregoing marketplace characteristics, combined with the experience of our directors and our management team and our current and future products, will enable our business model to succeed.

Strategy
 
Our strategy is to understand the complex genetic and molecular pathways regulating muscle mass and function as well as other disease mechanisms. Understanding the impact of complex regulatory pathways which act to build and maintain healthy lean muscle is central to our biotherapeutic research. We are developing nutritional products that target specific mechanisms to promote muscle health in ways that cannot be met by other diets or lifestyle changes.
 
We will seek to gain market share for our core branded products in functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehabilitation and restorative health verticals by (i) formulating and developing new and complementary product lines, (ii) expanding U.S. distribution by increasing the channels of sale, (iii) expanding distribution geography beyond the U.S. and (iv) seeking strategic relationships with other distributors. Our strategy is to utilize the revenue and awareness generated by the sales and marketing of Fortetropin® to further advance our research and development of therapeutic treatments for muscular disorders, including sarcopenia.
 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
Our commercial focus is to leverage our clinical data to develop multiple products to target the large, but currently underserved markets focused on muscle health. The sales channels through which we sell our products are evolving. The first product we introduced was MYO-T12, which was sold in the sports nutrition market. MYO T-12 is a proprietary formula containing Fortetropin® and other ingredients. The formula was sold under the brand name MYO-T12 and later as MYO-X through an exclusive distribution agreement with Maximum Human Performance (“MHP”). The exclusive distribution agreement with MHP terminated in March 2015 and there were no subsequent sales to MHP.
 
In February 2014, we expanded our commercial operations into the age management market through a distribution agreement with Cenegenics Product and Lab Services, LLC (“Cenegenics”), under which Cenegenics distributed and promoted a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin® through its age management centers and its community of physicians focused on treating a growing population of patients focused on proactively addressing age-related health and wellness concerns. The distribution agreement with Cenegenics expired in December 2016. As of December 31, 2016 we recognized all of the deferred revenue. In 2017, we recorded $200 of sales to Cenegenics.
 
During the second quarter of 2015 we launched Rē Muscle HealthTM, our own direct-to-consumer brand with a portfolio of muscle health bars, meal replacement shakes and daily supplement powders each powered by a full 6.6 gram single serving dose of Fortetropin®. Our Rē Muscle Health products were sold through our e-commerce website, remusclehealth.com, and amazon.com until March 2017 when we introduced our new Qurr line of products.
 
On March 13, 2017 we launched Qurr, a Fortetropin®-powered product line formulated to support the vital role of muscle in overall well-being as well as in fitness. Qurr is a line of flavored puddings, powders, and shakes for daily use. Our Qurr line of muscle-focused over-the-counter products are available through a convenient, direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform. All Qurr products contain Fortetropin®, our proprietary ingredient which has been clinically demonstrated to reduce serum myostatin levels which helps increase muscle size and lean body mass in conjunction with resistance training.
 
We expect to launch our Fortetropin based pet product in the near future. Two veterinarian hospitals, which performed some informal observational studies with older dogs experiencing muscle atrophy and saw positive results after taking our pet product, are seeking to purchase our product. We believe that the positive feedback we are receiving from these two hospitals, together with the potential results from our Kansas State University study, will enable us to launch and grow our pet business product line.
 
We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to us, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products. We expect to continue developing our own core branded products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and to pursue international sales opportunities. The growing awareness of the potential uses of myostatin reducing ingredients supports continued development of our own core products. We remain committed to continuing our focus on various clinical trials in support of enhancing our commercial strategy as well as enhancing our intellectual property assets, to develop product improvements and new products, and to reduce the cost of our products by finding more efficient manufacturing processes and contract manufacturers.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We have adopted a comprehensive intellectual property strategy, the implementation of which is ongoing. We are focusing our efforts on ensuring our current commercial products and processes, and those currently under development, are being protected to the maximum extent possible. We are in the process of filing multiple patent applications in the United States and abroad, and we are currently prosecuting pending patent applications in the United States, all of which are directed towards our compositions and methods of manufacturing the same. In addition to a proactive protection strategy, we are conducting defensive due diligence to ensure our products and processes do not encroach upon the rights of third parties. Moreover, we are also engaged in a survey of the intellectual property landscape of potential competitors, and are devising a proactive path to stay ahead of such potential competitors.

In addition to patent protection, we are also engaged in protecting our brands, including corporate brands and product brands, and have sought trademark registrations in the United States for the same. We have implemented a clearance strategy for new brands that we intend to launch, to ensure any risk of encroaching on the rights of third parties is minimized.
 
We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that protecting our key trademarks is crucial to our business strategy of building strong brand name recognition. These trademarks are crucial elements of our business, and have significant value in the marketing of our products. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, provided that they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used correctly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to attempt to cancel a trademark if priority is claimed or there is confusion of usage. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights generally are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used, while a United States federal registration of a trademark enables the registrant to stop the unauthorized use of the trademark by third parties in the United States. Much of our ongoing work, including our research and development, is kept highly confidential. As such, we have adopted corporate confidentiality policies that comply with the Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the New Jersey Trade Secret Act to protect our most valuable intellectual property assets.

Regulatory Environment
 
The importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling and advertising of our current and future products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, has primary jurisdiction over our products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The FDCA provides the regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements, foods and medical foods. In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. In addition, the Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, or APHIS, regulates the importation of our primary product from Germany. The Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction of product advertising.
 
The term “medical foods” does not pertain to all foods fed to sick patients. Medical foods are prescription foods specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. They were defined in the FDA’s 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments and are subject to the general food safety and labeling requirements of the FDCA but are exempt from the labeling requirements for health claims and nutrient content claims under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. Medical foods are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use and from traditional foods that bear a health claim. In order to be considered a medical food, a product must, at a minimum, be a specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring food in its natural state) for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube), be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements and be intended to be used under medical supervision.
 
Compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations is a critical part of our business. We endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. However, as with any regulated industry, the laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and there can be no assurances that a government agency would necessarily agree with our interpretation of the governing laws and regulations. Moreover, we are unable to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we predict what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. These regulations could, however, require the reformulation of our products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products not able to be reformulated. The risk of a product recall exists within the industry although we endeavor to minimize the risk of recalls by distributing products that are not adulterated or misbranded. However, the decision to initiate a recall is often made for business reasons in order to avoid confrontation with the FDA.
 
Our products are required to be prepared in compliance with the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, as set forth in 21 CFR Part 111. Fortetropin®, the active ingredient in our products, must be imported into the United States in conformance with USDA-APHIS’s requirements for egg products. Other statutory obligations include reporting all serious adverse events on a Medwatch Form 3500A. To date, we have not filed a Medwatch Form 3500A with the FDA nor have we been placed on notice regarding any serious adverse events related to any of our products. Since eggs are considered a major food allergen under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, we are required to label all our products containing Fortetropin® to note that they contain egg product.
 
Advertising of dietary supplement products is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive trade acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTCA provides that the dissemination of any false advertising pertaining to foods, including dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under the FTC’s substantiation doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a reasonable basis for all objective product claims before the claims are made. All advertising is required to be truthful and not misleading. All testimonials are required to be typical of the results the consumer may expect when using the product as directed. Accordingly, we are required to have adequate substantiation of all material advertising claims made for our products. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices.

In addition, medical foods must comply with all applicable requirements for the manufacturing of foods, including food Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), registration of food facility requirements and, if applicable, FDA regulations for low acid canned food and emergency permit controls. The FDA considers the statutory definition of medical foods to narrowly constrain the types of products that fit within this category of food. The FDA inspects medical food manufacturers annually to assure the safety and integrity of the products. Failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable requirements could lead to sanctions that could adversely affect our business.
 
We cannot predict what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
 
Manufacturing; Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
We are committed to producing and selling highly efficacious products that are trusted for their quality and safety. To date, our products have been outsourced to third party manufacturers where the products are manufactured in full compliance with cGMP standards set by the FDA. All of the raw materials for our current products are currently sourced from third-party suppliers. Any shortages in our raw materials could result in materially higher raw material prices and adversely affect our ability to source our product. Since the beginning of 2012, we have been focusing on the efficiency and economics of manufacturing Fortetropin®. Our management has examined the production cost and is working to achieve cost savings in production.
 
We currently have an agreement with only one third-party manufacturer of Fortetropin®, who will manufacture the formula exclusively for us in perpetuity, and may not manufacture the formula for other entities. We have multiple vendors for blending, packaging and labeling our products.
 
Competition
 
Given the large populations that could potentially benefit from myostatin modulation, a number of pharmaceutical companies are currently developing various types of myostatin inhibitors. Eli Lilly and Co., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Scholar Rock and Acceleron Pharma Inc, are among the companies that we are aware of that are testing new compounds in the field of myostatin inhibition. The market for nutritional supplements is highly competitive. Companies operating in the space include PepsiCo Inc., Glanbia Plc. GNC Holdings, The Coca-Cola Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Abbott Laboratories, Nestle S.A. and Universal Nutrition. Competition is based on price, quality, customer service, marketing and product effectiveness. Our competition includes numerous nutritional supplement companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies compete with us in the nutritional supplement market. These companies and certain nutritional supplement companies have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than us and have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Other companies are able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. Private label products of our competitors, which in recent years have significantly increased in certain nutrition categories, compete directly with our products. In several product categories, private label items are the market share leaders. Increased competition from such companies, including private label pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Many companies within our industry are privately-held and therefore, we are unable to assess the size of all of our competitors or where we rank in comparison to such privately-held competitors with respect to sales.
Insurance
 
We maintain commercial liability, including product liability coverage, and property insurance. Our policy provides for a general liability of $5.0 million per occurrence, and $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage. We carry property coverage on our main office facility to cover our legal liability, tenant’s improvements, business property, and inventory. We maintain commercial general liability and products liability insurance with coverage of up to $5.0 million.
Employees
 
We currently have ten full-time employees (including one executive officer). We also employ several consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good.
