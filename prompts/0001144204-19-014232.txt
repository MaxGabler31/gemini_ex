Item 1. Business
Howard Bancorp, Inc.
 
Howard Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Howard Bank, was incorporated in April 2005 under the laws of the State of Maryland to serve as the bank holding company of Howard Bank. The Company is a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). We file electronically with the SEC our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We make available on the investor relations page of our website at www.howardbank.com, free of charge, copies of these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing them to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Howard Bank
 
Howard Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company that was formed in March 2004 and commenced banking operations in August 2004. Howard Bank has currently chosen not to seek and exercise trust powers, and our business, powers and regulatory structure are the same as a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the “Commissioner”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and our deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Bank has seven subsidiaries; six are intended to hold foreclosed real estate (three of which are inactive) and one owns and manages real estate that is used as a branch location that also has office and retail space.
 
Howard Bank is headquartered in Baltimore City, Maryland. We consider our primary market area to be the Greater Baltimore metropolitan area. We engage in a general commercial banking business, making various types of loans and accepting deposits. We market our financial services to small-and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals. Our loans are primarily funded by core deposits of customers in our market.
 
Our core business strategy involves driving organic growth by delivering advice and superior customer service to clients through local decision makers. We combine the Bank’s specialized focus on both local markets and small- and medium-sized business related market segments with a broad array of products, new technology and seasoned banking professionals to position the Bank differently from most competitors. Our experienced executives establish a relationship with each client and bring value to all phases of a client’s business and personal banking needs. To develop this strategy, we have established long-standing relationships with key customers in the community and with local business leaders who can create business opportunities.
 
Our primary source of revenue is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we pay on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by provisions for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Our noninterest expense consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, as well as office occupancy, loan production expense, deposit insurance and general administrative and data processing expenses. Our operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly with respect to changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our leadership team is deep and experienced both as it relates to tenure with the Company as well as industry experience. Our Chairman and CEO, Mary Ann Scully, founded the Company and has over 35 years of banking experience, mainly in senior executive roles with larger financial institutions. In addition, the Company employs a strong stable of next level senior leadership, which it believes is critical for successful implementation of our strategic initiatives. It is this leadership experience that has driven the Company’s growth since its founding. In addition to organic growth, the Company has completed and integrated a bank acquisition, as further discussed below. We consider acquisitions to be a critical component of furthering future growth and will continue to cultivate and pursue strategic initiatives provided they generate meaningful long-term stockholder returns.
 
Our strategic plan focuses on enhancing stockholder value through market share growth as reflected in balance sheet growth, related revenue growth and resulting growth in operating profits. During the past several years we have expanded our branch locations both through opening new branches and acquiring branch offices via acquisition. While we anticipate opening additional branches in the counties where we now operate and in contiguous counties over the next several years, we currently have no definitive plans or agreements in place with respect to any additional branches. Our long-term vision includes supplementing our historically organic growth with strategically significant acquisitions. We believe that acquiring other financial institutions, in whole or in part, through business line spin-offs, branch sales or the hiring of teams of individuals, will allow us to expand our market, achieve certain operating efficiencies, and grow our stockholder base and thus our share value and liquidity. We believe that our demonstrated expertise in commercial lending and deposit gathering (especially non-interest bearing transactional deposits), our demonstrated ability to attract additional investment and capital, and community leadership positions us as an attractive acquirer. We also anticipate that increasing our capital levels will give us the ability to continue our organic asset growth and expand our relationships with key clients through a larger legal lending limit.

General Development of the Business 
 
On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with certain institutional accredited investors (the “Purchasers”) pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due December 6, 2028 (the “Notes”). The Notes were sold and issued by the Company to the Purchasers at a price equal to 100% of their face amount in a private offering in reliance on the exemptions from registration available under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the provisions of Regulation D thereunder.
 
On March 1, 2018, the Company completed its previously announced merger (the “Merger”) with First Mariner Bank, a Maryland chartered trust company (“First Mariner”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated August 14, 2017, and as amended by Amendment No. 1 on November 8, 2017, by and among the Company, the Bank and First Mariner (as amended, the “Agreement”). At the effective time of the Merger, First Mariner merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank continuing as the surviving bank of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger was described in the joint proxy and information statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on November 22, 2017.
 
At the effective time of the Merger, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, each outstanding share of First Mariner common stock and First Mariner Series A Non-Voting Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issued and outstanding was cancelled and converted into the right to receive 1.6624 shares of the Company’s common stock. To effect the Merger, the Company issued 9,143,222 shares of its common stock to First Mariner stockholders.
 
On February 1, 2017, the Company closed an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold 2,760,000 shares, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters to purchase an additional 360,000 shares, at the public offering price of $15.00 per share. The amount of gross proceeds raised in this offering was approximately $41.4 million, after underwriting discounts and estimated expenses, and the amount of net proceeds raised in this offering was $38.4 million. We used the proceeds of the offering to pay off the loan to Raymond James Bank, N.A. and retained the remainder. This had a positive impact on our liquidity and capital position in 2018 and provided funds that will continue to allow us to grow our loans and investments.
 
On May 6, 2016, we redeemed all of the 12,562 shares of the Series AA Preferred Stock that we had previously issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) under its Small Business Lending Fund (“SBLF”) program. The aggregate redemption price of the Series AA Preferred Stock was approximately $12.7 million, including dividends accrued but unpaid through the redemption date.
 
Our Market Area
 
Our headquarters are located in Baltimore City, Maryland. We consider our primary market area to be the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area in Maryland. We have certain loans in our loan portfolio that are outside our market area, although we do not actively solicit business outside our primary market.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 21 full services branches, as well as 11 mortgage and commercial lending offices located throughout Maryland. For additional detail regarding branch and lending office see “Item 2. Properties” below in this report.
 
Competitive Position
 
As a community bank with over $2 billion in assets, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate the ongoing market consolidation and heightened regulatory environment. We have the ability to outsource certain activities (internal audit, compliance review, information security monitoring) and to source new products and services in a highly efficient manner, allowing us to avoid the risk of impairment of operating earnings faced by some banks. We believe this offers an advantage over our competitors which may be locked into legacy systems, or which may find the onslaught of new regulations and evolving consumer expectations challenging. Strategic partnerships for these outsourced activities include contractual relationships with some of the largest and strongest providers of item processing, data processing, information monitoring and payment systems alternatives. We believe that this provides the Bank with the best of technology and product selection without sacrificing the more intimate delivery advantages of a community bank. We further believe the current economic and regulatory environment will continue to result in greater consolidation among financial institutions, including community banks. Some of that consolidation will occur with larger banks, thus exacerbating the scarcity of banks able to underwrite traditionally and offer advice in interactions with customers as we do, which we believe gives us a wider window of opportunity to extend our brand and value proposition. We believe, however, that to the extent some of that consolidation occurs between and among smaller banks, the resulting combined institutions will be better positioned to differentiate themselves.

We believe that our “Hands On” approach to delivering services to small- and medium-sized businesses is essential to our competitive position. Through a team of experienced advisors and providing them with access to local policy and decision makers, we offer an array of competitive credit and cash management services that we feel fills a “white space” in the market. We believe that we fit well between sophisticated, but often distracted large banks and responsive, but less capable small banks. Our relationship managers, team leaders and executive management generally have decades of banking experiences and are well established in the communities that they serve. They are able to interface with clients directly to share that experience and to provide connections with their own network of other specialized advisors. We believe we also benefit from our committed leadership at both the executive management and board level who bring a broad array of skills and experiences to our company and are able to position the Bank for consistent profitable growth.
 
Lending Activities
 
General
 Our primary market focus is making loans to and gathering deposits from small- and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals in our primary market area. Our loans are made to customers primarily in the Greater Baltimore market. Our lending activities consist generally of short- to medium-term commercial lending, commercial mortgage lending for both owner occupied and investment properties, residential mortgage lending, and consumer lending, both secured and unsecured. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans to businesses secured by real estate and/or other business assets.
Credit Policies and Administration 
 We have adopted a comprehensive lending policy that includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans. Our lending teams follow pricing guidelines established periodically by our management team. In an effort to manage risk, minimal lending authority is given to individual loan officers. Most loan officers can approve loans up to $100,000 (with a select number of loan officers having the authority to $500,000). The Chief Commercial Banking Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and the President can approve loans up to $2,000,000, or any two together can approve loans up to $4,000,000. Loans above these amounts are reviewed by an Officers’ Loan Committee (when less than or equal to $5,000,000) or by a Senior Loan Committee (when greater than $5,000,000). Under the leadership of our executive management team, we believe that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral, and carefully monitor the financial condition of our borrowers and the concentration of loans in our portfolio.
 
In addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and the related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market. Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions. Senior management monitors the loan portfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.
 
The Bank also retains an outside, independent firm to review the loan portfolio. This firm performs a detailed annual review. We use the results of the firm’s report primarily to validate the risk ratings applied to loans in the portfolio and identify any systemic weaknesses in underwriting, documentation or management of the portfolio. Results of the annual review are presented to executive management, the Asset Quality Committee of the board of directors of the Bank and the full board of directors of the Bank and are available to and used by regulatory examiners when they review the Bank’s asset quality. We currently use the firm of Strategic Risk Associates to perform this review.
 
The Bank maintains the normal checks and balances on the loan portfolio not only through the underwriting process but through the utilization of an internal credit administration group that both assists in the underwriting and serves as an additional reviewer of underwriting. The separately-managed loan administration group also has oversight for documentation, compliance and timeliness of collection activities. Our outsourced internal audit firm also reviews documentation, compliance and file management.
 
Commercial Lending 

Our commercial lending consists of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, accounts receivable and inventory financing, term loans, equipment loans, small business administration (“SBA”) loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We originate commercial loans for any business purpose, including the financing of leasehold improvements and equipment, the carrying of accounts receivable, general working capital, contract administration and acquisition activities. These loans typically have maturities of seven years or less. We have a diverse client base and we do not have a concentration of these types of loans in any specific industry segment. We generally secure commercial business loans with accounts receivable and inventory, equipment, indemnity deeds of trust and other collateral such as marketable securities, cash value of life insurance, and time deposits at Howard Bank. Commercial business loans have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the availability of funds for repayment generally depends on the success of the business. To help manage this risk, we establish parameters/covenants at the inception of the loan to provide early warning systems before payment default. We normally seek to obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners. We are able, given our business model, to proactively monitor the financial condition of the business.

Commercial Mortgage Lending 

We finance commercial real estate for our clients, for both owner-occupied properties and investment properties (including residential properties). We generally will finance owner occupied commercial real estate at a maximum loan-to-value of 85% and non-owner occupied at a maximum loan-to-value of 80%. Our underwriting policies and processes focus on the underlying credit of the owner for owner occupied real estate and on the rental income stream (including rent terms and strength of tenants) for non-owner occupied real estate as well as an assessment of the underlying real estate. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to vacancy rates/absorption rates for surrounding properties, sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate. We attempt to mitigate these risks by carefully underwriting loans of this type as well as by following appropriate loan-to-value standards. We are cash flow lenders and never rely solely on property valuations in reaching a lending decision. Personal guarantees are often required for commercial real estate loans as they are for other commercial loans. Most of our real estate loans carry fixed interest rates and amortize over 20 to 25 years but have five- to seven-year maturities. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans primarily include office buildings, office condominiums, distribution facilities and manufacturing plants. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area.


Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than residential properties.
 
Construction Lending 
 Construction lending can cover funding for land acquisition, land development and/or construction of residential or commercial structures. Our construction loans generally bear a variable rate of interest and have terms of one to two years. Funds are advanced on a percentage-of-completion basis. These loans are generally repaid at the end of the development or construction phase, although loans for both residential and commercial construction will often convert into a permanent mortgage loan at the end of the term of the loan. Loan to value parameters range from 65% of the value of land to 75% for developed land, 80% for commercial or multifamily construction and 85% for residential construction. These loan-to-value ratios represent the upper limit of advance rates to remain in compliance with Bank policy. Typically, loan-to-value ratios should be somewhat lower than these upper limits, requiring the borrower to provide significant equity at the inception of the loan. Our underwriting looks not only at the value of the property but the expected cash flows to be generated by sale of the parcels or completed construction. The borrower must have solid experience in this type of construction and personal guarantees are usually required.
 
Construction lending entails significant risks compared with residential mortgage lending. These risks involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers with funds advanced upon the security of the land or the project under construction. The value of the project is estimated prior to the completion of construction. Thus, it is more difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project and related loan to value ratios. If the estimate of construction or development cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. To mitigate these risks, in addition to the underwriting considerations noted above, we maintain an in-house construction monitoring unit that has oversight for the projects and we require both site visits and frequent reporting before funds are advanced.
 
Residential Mortgage Lending 
 We offer a variety of consumer-oriented residential real estate loans. Residential mortgage loans consist primarily of first mortgage loans to individuals, most of which have a loan to value not exceeding 85%. The remainder of this portion of our portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit and fixed rate home equity loans.
 
Our residential mortgage loans are generally for owner-occupied single family homes. These loans are generally for a primary residence although we will occasionally originate loans for a second home where the borrower has extremely strong credit. We originate adjustable rate residential mortgage loans with initial fixed-rate terms of five to seven years, as well as fixed rate residential mortgage loans with primarily 15- or 30-year terms.

Our home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are primarily secured by a second mortgage on owner occupied one-to four-family residences. Our home equity loans are originated at fixed interest rates and with terms of between five and 30 years for primary residences and between five and 15 years for secondary and rental properties, and are fully amortizing. Our home equity lines allow for the borrower to draw against the line for ten years, after which the line is refinanced into a ten-year fixed loan, with the possibility of a one-time extension of five years. Home equity lines of credit carry a variable rate of interest and minimum monthly payments during the draw period, which are the greater of (i) $50.00 or (ii) depending on credit score, loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, either the interest due or interest due plus 1% of the outstanding loan balance. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 85% (80% when appraised value is greater than $1 million) for a primary residence when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan; for home equity loans on secondary and rental properties, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 65%. We require appraisals on all real estate loans – both commercial and residential. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral.
 
Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In these cases, we face the risk that collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. In particular, because home equity loans are secured by second mortgages, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of the property serving as collateral for these loans. Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to repay us for the value of these loans.
 
Loans secured by second mortgages have greater risk than owner-occupied residential loans secured by first mortgages. When customers default on their loans we attempt to foreclose on the property. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from these customers. In addition, decreases in property values could adversely affect the value of properties used as collateral for the loans. These second lien loans represent a smaller portion of our portfolio than our first lien residential mortgage loans.
 
Our home equity and home improvement loan portfolio gives us a diverse client base. Although most of these loans are in our primary market area, the diversity of the individual loans in the portfolio reduces our potential risk.
 
Consumer Lending 
 We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. Generally, our consumer loans are made for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base. As a general guideline, a consumer’s total debt service should not exceed 40% of their gross income. The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of his or her ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.
 
Consumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because many consumer loans are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciating assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. Consumer loan collections also depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability. If a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid. Also, various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.
 
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing 
 All loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard underwriting guidelines. We originate both fixed and variable rate loans. Our loan origination activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. We generally retain in our portfolio the majority of loans that we originate, except for first lien residential mortgage loans where we sell the majority of the loans into the secondary market. We do not retain the servicing rights on sold loans.
 
We occasionally sell participations in commercial loans to correspondent banks if the amount of the loan exceeds our internal limits. More rarely, we purchase loan participations from correspondent banks in the local market as well. Those loans are underwritten in-house with the same care of loans directly originated.
 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable. To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors, current income, credit history including the Bank’s prior experience with the borrower, cash flow, any secondary sources of repayment, other debt obligations in regards to the equity/net worth of the borrower and collateral available to the Bank to secure the loan.

-

 

We require appraisals of all real property securing one- to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. All appraisers are state-licensed or state-certified appraisers, and our practice is to have local appraisers approved by our board of directors annually.
 
Mortgage Banking
 
Our residential mortgage loans consist of residential first and second mortgage loans, residential construction loans and home equity lines of credit and term loans secured by the residences of borrowers. Borrowers use second mortgage and home equity lines of credit for home improvements, education and other personal expenditures. We make mortgage loans with a variety of terms, including fixed, floating and variable interest rates, with maturities ranging from three months to 30 years.
 
In general, we make residential mortgage loans based on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan from his or her salary and other income; such loans are secured by residential real estate, the value of which is generally readily ascertainable. We make these loans consistent with our appraisal and real estate lending policies, which detail maximum loan-to-value ratios and maturities. We generally make residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit secured by owner-occupied property within the guidelines of our regular purchasers of these loans.
 
Howard Bank generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. We offer products available to customers through a retail network of mortgage loan officers and bankers as well as a sales force offering our customers direct access to our products.
 
The Bank originates residential mortgage loans primarily as a correspondent lender. Activity in the residential mortgage loan market is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and product availability. While the Bank does have delegated underwriting authority from most of its loan purchasers, at times it also employs the services of the purchaser to underwrite the loans. Because the loans are originated within purchaser guidelines and designated automated underwriting and product specific requirements as part of the loan application, the loans sold have a limited recourse provision. Most contracts with investors contain recourse periods. In general, the Bank may be required to repurchase a previously sold mortgage loan or indemnify the purchaser if there is non-compliance with defined loan origination or documentation standards, including fraud, negligence or material misstatement in the loan documents. In addition, the Bank may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term. The potential default repurchase period varies by purchaser but can be up to approximately 12 months after sale of the loan to the purchaser. The recourse period for fraud, material misstatement, breach of representations and warranties, noncompliance with law, or similar matters could be as long as the term of the loan. Mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single-family residential properties, follow purchaser guidelines, and carry private mortgage insurance, where applicable.
 
The Bank enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (i.e. rate lock commitments). Such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered to be derivatives. To protect against the price risk inherent in residential mortgage loan commitments, the Bank utilizes “best efforts” in delivering to purchasers. Under a “best efforts” contract, the Bank commits to deliver an individual mortgage loan of a specified principal amount and quality to a purchaser and the purchaser commits to a price that it will purchase the loan from the Bank if the loan to the underlying borrower closes. The Bank protects itself from changes in interest rates through the use of best efforts forward delivery commitments, whereby the purchaser commits to purchase a loan at a price representing a premium on the day the borrower commits to an interest rate with the intent that the purchaser has assumed the interest rate risk on the loan. As a result, the Bank is not generally exposed to losses on loans sold utilizing best efforts. Nor will it realize gains related to rate lock commitments due to changes in interest rates. The market values of rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not readily ascertainable with precision because rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts are not actively traded. Because of the high correlation between rate lock commitments and best efforts contracts, we do not expect to incur any gain or loss on the rate lock commitments.
 
Investments and Funding
 
We balance our liquidity needs based on loan and deposit growth via the investment portfolio and both short- and long-term borrowings. It is our goal to provide adequate liquidity to support our loan growth. A portion of our investment portfolio is generally kept short-term securities for liquidity purposes, and a portion of the portfolio is used to generate additional positive earnings. The Bank’s primary source of funds is, and will continue to be, core deposits generated from our market area. Additional funding is provided by overnight unsecured master notes, customer repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) advances, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “FRB”) Discount Window, subordinated debentures and other purchased funds. Other purchased funds may include certificates of deposit (“CDs”) over $100,000, federal funds purchased, and institutional or brokered deposits. Lines of credit are maintained to protect liquidity levels resulting from unexpected deposit withdrawals and natural-market credit demand.

Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors. Our board of directors has appointed its Board Asset Liability Committee to serve as the Investment Committee, and the Board Asset Liability Committee therefore meets at regular intervals (not less than quarterly) and provides a report on the investment portfolio performance to our full board of directors. The investment officer is designated by the CEO and is responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of the liquidity and investments in accordance with the policies approved by our board of directors. We actively monitor our investment portfolio and we classify the majority of the portfolio as “available for sale.” In general, under such a classification, we may sell investment instruments as management deems appropriate.
 
Other Banking Products
 
We offer our customers wire transfer services, ATM and check cards, automated teller machines (“ATMs”) at all of our branch locations, safe deposit boxes at most branches and credit cards through a third party processor. Additionally, we provide Internet banking capabilities to our customers and merchant card services for our business customers. With our Internet banking service, our customers may view their accounts on line and electronically remit bill payments including an option for same day payment. Our commercial account services include an overnight sweep service and remote deposit capture service.
 
We complement our existing Internet banking services with Mobiliti Mobile Banking, PopMoney and eStatement products.  These state of the art products provide the Bank's consumer customers the ability to view account information and pay bills from their mobile device, easily make payments directly to individuals and, with eStatements, to replace their paper monthly statement with an electronically delivered statement.
 
Deposit Activities
 
Deposits are the major source of our funding. We offer a broad array of consumer and business deposit products that include demand, money market, savings and individual retirement accounts, as well as CDs. We offer through key technology partnerships a competitive array of commercial cash management products, which in combination with our in-house courier service and remote deposit/check imaging service, allow us to attract demand deposits. We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest bearing deposits. As a relationship-oriented organization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.
 
We also use customer repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, the FRB Discount Window and other purchased funds as a funding mechanism. Other purchased funds may include CDs over $100,000, federal funds purchased and institutional or brokered deposits.
 
Employees
 
Howard Bank has 331 full-time and six part-time employees as of December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit, and we believe that relations with our employees are good. Howard Bancorp has no employees.
Lending Limit
 
The Bank’s legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was $31.8 million as of December 31, 2018, and we further monitor our exposure to one borrower through a policy to limit our “in-house” lending limit to $25.0 million as of December 31, 2018, which in-house limit can be exceeded on a limited basis. As part of our risk management strategy, we may attempt to participate a portion of larger loans to other financial institutions. This strategy allows us to maintain customer relationships yet observe the legal lending limit and manage credit exposure. However, this strategy may not always be available.
Competition
 
Our primary market area is highly competitive and heavily branched by other financial institutions of all sizes. We also compete with Internet-based banks. Competition for loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals is intense, and pricing is important. We believe that acquisitions of several local competitors by larger institutions headquartered outside of the State of Maryland during the last several years have enhanced the Bank’s position as a locally headquartered and managed community bank, but many of these competitors now have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and offer services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, that we do not expect to provide in the near future or ever. Moreover, larger institutions operating in our primary market area may have access to borrowed funds at a lower rate than is available to us. Deposit competition is also strong among institutions in our primary market area.

However, recent mergers of other area banks into large regional and national financial institutions have created opportunities for community-focused and prudently managed community banks. While our board of directors is aware of the competition that these larger institutions and alternative providers of financial services offer, we believe that local independent banks play and will continue to play a significant role in our primary market area. Our board of directors believes it is a significant and distinct advantage to be a locally owned and operated state bank interested in serving the needs of small- and medium-sized businesses and their owners, professionals and executives, and high-net-worth individuals.

We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). We are subject to regulation and examination by the FRB and the Commissioner, and are required to file periodic reports and any additional information that the FRB and the Commissioner may require. In addition, the FRB and the Commissioner have enforcement authority over Howard Bancorp, which includes the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease and desist orders to prevent Howard Bancorp from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
 
Under FRB regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under this requirement, Howard Bancorp in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to Howard Bank should Howard Bank experience financial distress. In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice, a violation of FRB regulations or both. The FRB may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the FRB’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.
 
The BHC Act requires regulatory filings by a stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank, as defined in the BHC Act. The determination whether an investor “controls” bank is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a bank or other company if the party: (i) owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or other company; (ii) can elect or appoint a majority of the board of directors, or similar body, of the bank or other company; or (iii) exercises a "controlling influence" over the bank or other company. The FRB may require a company that owns between 5% and 25% of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company to make certain non-control or “passivity” commitments. If a party were deemed to “control” Howard Bancorp for BHC Act purposes, the party would become a bank holding company and subject it to filing and other regulatory requirements.
 
Separately, an investor that owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank or bank holding company and (i) the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and (ii) no other person owns, controls or has the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting securities is considered a “control” person under the Change in Bank Control Act (the “CIBC Act”) and may be required to file a change in control notice with the primary federal regulator of the bank or with the FRB. For the purposes of both the BHC Act and the CIBC Act, ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated.
 
Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the FRB thereunder, Howard Bancorp may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the FRB to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the FRB prior to engaging in most new business activities. In addition, bank holding companies like Howard Bancorp must be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in the expanded financial activities permissible only for a financial holding company.
 
The FRB has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets. See “— Capital Requirements.” The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Under the prompt corrective action rules, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Howard Bancorp to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

The status of Howard Bancorp as a registered bank holding company under the BHC Act and a Maryland-chartered bank holding company does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 
Howard Bank
 
Howard Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company (with all powers of a commercial bank), and its deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits. It is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Commissioner and the FDIC. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of Howard Bank’s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and location and number of branch offices. The laws and regulations governing Howard Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and not for the purpose of protecting Howard Bancorp or its stockholders.
 
Set forth below is a brief description of the material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Howard Bank and Howard Bancorp. The description below is limited to the material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Howard Bank and Howard Bancorp.
 
Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code
 
The Financial Institutions Article of the Maryland Annotated Code (the “Banking Code”) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, operations, corporate powers, commercial and investment authority, branching rights and responsibilities of directors, officers and employees of Maryland banking institutions. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Commissioner in its supervision and regulation of state-chartered banking institutions. The Commissioner may order any banking institution to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice.
Capital Requirements
 
Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). These requirements may change significantly with the enactment in May 2018 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Reform, and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), as explained below.
 
There are three main categories of capital under the capital adequacy guidelines. Common equity tier 1 capital consists of paid-in common stock, retained earnings and certain common equity Tier 1 minority interests. Various items, including certain amounts of goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets, must be deducted from common equity Tier 1 before capital ratios are calculated. Tier 1 capital (which, together with common equity tier 1 capital, makes up Tier 1 capital) generally consists of perpetual preferred stock and, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, minority investments in certain subsidiaries, less goodwill and other non-qualifying intangible assets, and certain other deductions. Tier 2 capital consists of perpetual preferred stock that is not otherwise eligible to be included as Tier 1 capital, hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock and, subject to limitations, general allowances for credit losses. At least half of total capital must consist of Tier 1 capital. Accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in regulatory capital.
 
Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, the regulations limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions, engage in share repurchases and pay certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The regulations also require unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless Howard Bank elects to opt-out from this treatment, which it has.
 
The risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer may be replaced by a single capital requirement known as the community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”). EGRRCPA provided that banks (and bank holding companies) with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets (and that meet certain other prerequisites) may, in place of the current requirements, hold enough tangible equity relative to average total consolidated assets sufficient to satisfy the CBLR standard. These banks would be deemed to meet all generally applicable capital requirements and to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regime (described further below). EGRRCPA directs the federal banking agencies to set the precise CBLR within a range of 8% to 10%. In November 2018, the agencies proposed a leverage ratio standard of 9.0%. We do not know if or when the agencies will finalize this rule. The Bank and the Company currently would both satisfy a 9.0% CBLR requirement.
 
Prompt Corrective Action 
 
Under federal prompt corrective action regulations, the bank regulatory agencies are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required, to take various “prompt corrective actions” to resolve the problems of any bank subject to their jurisdiction that is not adequately capitalized. Depending on their capital levels, every insured depository institution is in one of five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, a bank is considered “well capitalized” if it: (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater; (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2018, Howard Bank remained “well capitalized” for this purpose and its capital exceeded all applicable requirements. Well capitalized status is a prerequisite for certain types of favorable regulatory treatment, including expedited processing of applications by the FDIC and the ability to rely on brokered deposits.

Howard Bank has been “well capitalized” since it commenced its business operations.
 
The bank regulatory agencies may impose higher capital requirements on certain banks, and future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. The regulators may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
 
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
 
Dividends
 
Howard Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Howard Bank. Virtually all of Howard Bancorp’s revenue available for the payment of dividends on its common stock results from dividends paid to Howard Bancorp by Howard Bank. Under Maryland law, Howard Bank may declare a cash dividend, after providing for due or accrued expenses, losses, interest and taxes, from its undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, from its surplus in excess of 100% of its required capital stock. Also, if Howard Bank’s surplus is less than 100% of its required capital stock, then, until its surplus is 100% of its capital stock, Howard Bank must transfer to its surplus annually at least 10% of its net earnings and may not declare or pay any cash dividends that exceed 90% of its net earnings. Howard Bank generally may not pay a dividend if, as a result of the dividend, it would be undercapitalized. While the 2.5% capital conservation buffer requirement remains in place, Howard Bank’s ability to pay dividends would be restricted if it failed to maintain the buffer. In addition to these specific restrictions, the bank regulatory agencies have the ability to prohibit or limit proposed dividends if such regulatory agencies determine the payment of such dividends would result in Howard Bank being in an unsafe and unsound condition.
Deposit Insurance Assessments 
 
Howard Bank’s deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. FDIC-insured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. The amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is determined by an FDIC risk-based assessment system. The assessment is a function of a financial ratios method that takes into account seven financial ratios and the institution’s weighted average CAMELS component ratings. The assessment must be within a range that depends on the institution’s composite CAMELS rating, and the assessment will be adjusted up or down to come within the range. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 1.5 to 30 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC’s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution’s aggregate deposits. The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The FDIC has recently provided a preliminary notification to banks with less than $10 billion in assets, that they may be eligible for assessment credits as the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) has exceeded predefined levels (a 1.35% DIF ratio). However these credits will not be awarded until the DIF ratio exceeds 1.38%, which as of December 31, 2018 had not yet occurred. Thus, while there exists a chance that FDIC insured institutions may receive credits against future assessments, the triggering event for this has not yet occurred, and there is no assurance that it is likely to occur in the future.
Maryland Regulatory Assessment
 
The Commissioner annually assesses state banking institutions to cover the expense of regulating banking institutions. The Bank’s asset size determines the amount of the assessment.
 
Liquidity
 
Howard Bank is subject to the reserve requirements imposed by the State of Maryland. A Maryland banking institution is required to have at all times a reserve equal to at least 15% of its demand deposits. Howard Bank is also subject to the uniform reserve requirements of the FRB’s Regulation D, which applies to all insured depository institutions with transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. During 2018, amounts in transaction accounts above $16.3 million and up to $107.9 million were required to have reserves held against them in the ratio of 3% of such amounts. Amounts above $107.9 million required reserves of $3.2 million plus 10% of the amount in excess of $107.9 million. The FRB changes its reserve requirements on an annual basis and Howard Bank is subject to new requirements for 2019. Howard Bank was in compliance with its reserve requirements at December 31, 2018 and is in compliance with its current reserve requirements.

Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitation
 
With certain limited exceptions, a Maryland banking institution may lend to a single or related group of borrowers an aggregate amount no more than 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain securities and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. Howard Bank is in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
Commercial real estate loans are subject to two types of regulatory oversight. If total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent more than 100% of a bank’s total capital or if total CRE loans represent 300% or more of total capital and have grown by 50% or more in the last 36 months, the bank is expected to have enhanced risk management and will be subject to greater regulatory scrutiny. In addition, the risk-based capital rules (so long as they are applicable) presumptively risk weight commercial real estate loans at 100% but impose a 150% risk weight on loans deemed to be high volatility. Among other things, the capital rules required that a borrower contribute 15% of the equity of a financed project in order for the loan to qualify for the lower risk weight. EGRRCPA narrowed the types of loans potentially subject to the higher risk weight but did not eliminate that risk weight.
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws
 
Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if such institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) that they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and new branches. Howard Bank has a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.” In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics, such as ethnicity, gender, and race, as specified in each statute. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Justice, and in private civil actions by borrowers.
Transactions with Related Parties
 
Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank.
 
Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation W limit the “covered transactions” in which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit such covered transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus. The term ‘‘covered transaction’’ includes loans, asset purchases, issuances of guarantees, and other similar transactions that expose the bank to the credit risk of an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the bank to an affiliate must be collateralized in accordance with regulatory requirements. The bank’s transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and may not involve the purchase by the bank of any low-quality asset. Section 23B applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to non-affiliates.
 
Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O govern extensions of credit made by a bank to its directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (‘‘insiders’’). Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Further, such extensions may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Howard Bank’s capital. Extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must also be approved by the board of directors.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
 
Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a “cease and desist” order or the imposition of civil money penalties.

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
 
Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain programs to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism that include established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; testing of the program by an independent audit function; and a “know your customer” program with enhanced due diligence of certain customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering; they must file currency transaction reports for deposits and withdrawals of large amounts of currency and suspicious activity reports of possible criminal activity. Financial institutions also must assess their money laundering risk with respect to private banking and foreign correspondent banking relationships. Law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 
Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering compliance has been a special focus of the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the other Federal banking agencies in recent years. Any non-compliance is likely to result in an enforcement action, often with substantial monetary penalties and reputation damage. A savings association or bank that is required to strengthen its compliance program often must put on hold any initiatives that require banking agency approval.
 
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC sends bank regulatory agencies lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If Howard Bancorp or Howard Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, Howard Bancorp or Howard Bank must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities.
 
Consumer Protection Laws
 
Howard Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and various state law counterparts. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The FDIC will examine Howard Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and will enforce CFPB rules with respect to Howard Bank.
 
In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and practices regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Further, under the ‘‘Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards,’’ banks must implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.
 
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 
Our earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The FRB’s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the FRB’s power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the FRB affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through the FRB’s control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.
Federal and State Securities Laws
 
Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act. As such, we are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the Exchange Act.

Further, if we wish to sell common stock or other securities to raise capital in the future, we will be subject to the registration, anti-fraud, and other applicable provisions of state and federal securities laws. For example, we will have to register the sales of such securities under the Securities Act, the Maryland Securities Act, and the applicable securities laws of each state in which we offer or sell the securities, unless an applicable exemption from registration exists with respect to such sales. Such exemptions may, among other things, limit the number and types of persons we could sell such securities to and the manner in which we could market the securities. We would also be subject to federal and state anti-fraud requirements with respect to any statements we make to potential purchasers in connection with the offer and sale of such securities.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and related regulations.
 
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) 
 
In 2017, a committee of private-market derivative participants and their regulators convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (“ARRC”), was created to identify an alternative reference interest rate to replace LIBOR.
 The ARRC announced the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. The Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. Subsequently, the FRB announced final plans for the production of SOFR, which resulted in the commencement of its published rates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on April 2, 2018. The Company has contracts, including loan and derivative contracts, that are currently indexed to LIBOR and are monitoring these developments and evaluating related risks.
