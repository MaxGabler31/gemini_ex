Pipeline of Development Programs and Commercial Products
 Below is a summary of our internally developed, proprietary portfolio: 

We also own and have rights to other clinical and preclinical stage compounds that were internally discovered by us.
 Etrasimod Program
 Etrasimod is a next-generation, oral, selective sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, discovered by Arena, designed to provide systemic and local cell modulation by selectively targeting S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4 and 5. Etrasimod has therapeutic potential in immune and inflammatory-mediated diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and atopic dermatitis. S1P receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of several biological responses, including lymphocyte trafficking from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood. By isolating subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to effect tissue damage.
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases
 Inflammatory bowel diseases, or IBD, like ulcerative colitis, or UC, and Crohn’s disease, or CD, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that affect approximately 3.1 million patients in the US alone. The prevalence of UC and CD in the US are currently estimated at 1.8 million and 1.3 million patients, respectively. The prevalence of IBD in European Union, or EU, is estimated at 3.0 million with 1.7 million patients with UC and 1.3 million patients with CD. Both conditions have a significant impact on the patient’s quality of life and can in many cases be very aggressive and disabling.
 3


UC is characterized by mucosal inflammation limited to the colon which involves the rectum in approximately 95% of cases and may extend to involve parts or all of the large intestine. In contrast, CD is characterized by full thickness inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract but most typically involves the terminal ileum and colon; and causes fistulation and scarring. Symptoms for UC and CD can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rectal bleeding. 
 Important goals of therapy for IBD are to induce and maintain remission while improving the patient’s quality of life. Currently available treatment options have limitations in terms of long-term efficacy and side effects, have complicated administration regimens, and often fail to induce or maintain remission. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need remains for differentiated oral agents that are efficacious for induction and maintenance therapy with a favorable side effect profile. We believe that the oral once-daily dosing, selectivity, mechanism of action, and emerging clinical profile of etrasimod may represent a significant opportunity to provide patients with an effective treatment for IBD with an improved safety and dosing profile over current therapies. 
 Atopic Dermatitis
 Atopic Dermatitis, or AD, is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by dry skin, pruritus, and relapsing lesions. AD has a severe impact on quality of life, including potential occupational, social, and psychological impairments. The adult prevalence is approximately 18 million patients in the US and 22 million patients in the EU. 
 A survey published in 2016 showed that 86% of patients were not satisfied with current treatment options. Two new therapies have been marketed since 2016, however these treatments have less desirable administration routes and are not effective in all patients. Long-term efficacy of these therapies also remains relatively unknown. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need remains for differentiated, safe, oral agents that are effective and have a favorable side effect profile. 
 AD pathology is driven by a combination of impaired skin epithelial barriers, altered microbiota, and aberrant inflammation driven by activated immune cells, including skin-infiltrating T cells and dendritic cells, or DCs. Etrasimod may have the potential to reduce DC migration/activation (S1P receptor subtypes 1 and 4 mediated) and T cell infiltration (S1P receptor subtype 1 mediated) in the skin. These effects could reduce the T cell-mediated inflammation in the skin that underlies atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. 
 Etrasimod Development
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 We are currently preparing for a Phase 3 program in UC and a Phase 2b/3 program in CD. 
 In 2019, we announced positive results from a 34-week open-label extension, or OLE, of the Phase 2 OASIS trial of etrasimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The trial enrolled 118 patients (84% of OASIS study completers), of which 22 completers also received 2 mg in OASIS, for a total of 46 weeks of treatment with etrasimod. Overall, etrasimod demonstrated durable, long-term clinical remission and was generally safe and well tolerated in this trial. Adverse events in the OLE study were generally mild to moderate in severity and no new safety findings were noted. Impact on heart rate and atrioventricular, or AV, conduction was minimal throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block.
 In 2018, we announced topline results from OASIS, a dose finding 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational Phase 2 clinical trial of etrasimod in moderate to severe UC. The aim of the trial was to investigate a clear dose response and establish a clinically meaningful signal for the active arm(s) from placebo. The trial evaluated the effects of etrasimod at 1mg and 2mg versus placebo on multiple efficacy measures including a three-component partial Mayo Clinic Score, clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement in 156 patients. Etrasimod demonstrated a clear dose response and statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the primary, all secondary, and clinical remission endpoints at the 2 mg dose. There were fewer patients with serious adverse events, or SAEs, compared to placebo (0% in 2 mg, 5.8% in 1 mg and 11.1% in placebo). Impact on heart rate and atrioventricular, or AV, conduction was low throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block. There were no increases in liver function tests compared to placebo and no reports of macular edema or pulmonary function test abnormalities. In this trial, etrasimod was well tolerated and safety results support a potential best-in-class profile.

Δ = % difference from placebo estimated using Mantel-Haenszel method adjusted with current oral corticosteroid use and prior exposure to TNFa antagonists.
 Atopic Dermatitis
 We are currently preparing for a Phase 2 program in atopic dermatitis. 
 In 2018, we evaluated data from relevant patients with dermatological conditions in etrasimod trials. We believe the data we have, although limited, support ongoing investigation of etrasimod in skin disorders. 
Prior Development
 Starting in 2017, we initiated exploratory Phase 2, proof-of-concept, open-label studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with pyoderma gangrenosum, primary biliary cholangitis and active dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations of IBD. We decided to conclude these studies based on our strategic focus on IBD and atopic dermatitis.
 In January 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in blood, with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. Lymphocyte counts, on average, recovered to baseline within one week of conclusion of dosing. There was a modest impact on heart rate, but none of the changes were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. There were also no findings with respect to pulmonary function or liver enzyme tests that were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea, with none being clearly drug related. There were no discontinuations for adverse events, and no serious adverse events were observed. 
 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of etrasimod. In five different dosing cohorts, 50 healthy volunteers received etrasimod and 10 healthy volunteers received placebo for 21 days.
 Prior to commencing the Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod, we completed a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the compound. This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of etrasimod in 40 healthy adult volunteers. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, a dose-responsive reduction in blood lymphocyte count and a slowing of heart rate that appears comparable to other S1P receptor modulators. The terminal half-life was approximately 35 hours.
 Etrasimod Intellectual Property 
 As of February 15, 2019, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for etrasimod and related compounds, methods of treatment utilizing etrasimod and related compounds, and various salts of etrasimod and crystalline forms thereof in 61 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, India, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and had an application pending in one other jurisdiction (Brazil). Patents on etrasimod issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office include serial numbers US 8,580,841, US 9,126,932, and US 9,522,133 while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 2326621 B2. We also own issued patents and/or pending applications directed to solid-state forms of etrasimod, dosage regimens for etrasimod, synthetic routes and intermediates useful in the manufacturing of etrasimod, and other methods of treatment utilizing etrasimod. The earliest priority date for the patents on etrasimod is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.

Olorinab Program
 Olorinab, a potentially first-in-class, orally available, potent, peripherally restricted, highly selective, full agonist of the CB2 receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate we are exploring for the treatment of visceral pain, specifically pain associated with the gastrointestinal system, such as IBD and irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS.
 Visceral pain is defined as pain that originates within muscle, pleura, connective tissue, nervous system or solid organs within the abdomen or peritoneum. It is distinct from somatic or neuropathic pain, and is perceived as stretching, pulling and distention, rather than by cutting, crushing, or burning more commonly associated with neuropathic pain. Visceral pain is one of the most common types of pain. For example, abdominal pain affects approximately 20% of the general population. Visceral pain may be caused by a diverse set of organic causes, such as inflammation (e.g., IBD, including CD and UC, pancreatitis, prostatitis, and vaginitis), obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction, and nephrolithiasis), ischemia, and malignancy, among others. Visceral pain may also be caused by functional disorders such as interstitial cystitis, dyspepsia, IBS, and vulvodynia.
  There are approximately 3.1 million patients in the US with IBD, with 90% experiencing abdominal pain or cramps. There are approximately 24 million patients in the US with IBS, with 78% reporting frequently recurring or continuous abdominal pain. Common treatments for visceral pain range from non-invasive, conservative approaches (e.g., physical therapy or acupuncture), to pharmacologic (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants acting as neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors), and invasive interventions (e.g., bowel resection). Potent analgesics, such as opioids, can adversely affect GI function. Other commonly prescribed analgesics are often not potent enough and may lead to other GI side effects such as bleeding. Except for linaclotide and lubiprostone, prescribed for IBS, no visceral-specific analgesics are currently available. Approximately one in eight CD patients is chronically treated with opioids.
 The CB2 receptor is expressed in the GI nervous system, and in many tissues and organs of the abdomen. CB2 receptors are found peripherally on immune cells but also on microglia, terminal neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and on visceral sensory neurons. We believe selectively targeting the CB2 receptor may provide therapeutic benefit for visceral pain without the potential for dependence, abuse, and GI and cardiovascular side effects associated with opiates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are among the most common pain relievers. In addition to analgesic effects, olorinab may have anti-inflammatory properties. 
 Olorinab is designed to be a peripherally restricted and selective CB2 receptor agonist and is intended to provide pain relief without the unwanted side effects associated with CB1 receptor activation.
 Olorinab Development
 In 2018, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2a trial of olorinab in development for the treatment of pain associated with CD. This exploratory study was an open‑label investigation to evaluate safety and tolerability of olorinab in this patient population and to gain initial insights into its efficacy via a pain visual analog scale, or VAS. Fourteen patients were enrolled into two cohorts at 25 mg and 100 mg administered three times daily for up to eight weeks. Reductions in pain were seen within the first week of treatment and statistically significant improvement from baseline in Average Abdominal Pain Score, or AAPS, at weeks four and eight. In this trial, olorinab appeared safe and generally well tolerated with no clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure, no psychotropic effects, and no discontinuations due to adverse events.

In April 2016, we announced favorable results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 36 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of olorinab. Cohorts of 12 subjects (9 active, 3 placebo) were administered doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of olorinab or placebo three times daily for 10 days and, in connection with the pharmacokinetic evaluation, one time on the 11th day. The most common adverse events were headache and nausea. All adverse events were classified as mild, and there were no serious adverse events reported. There was one discontinuation in the high-dose group due to an adverse event of mild thirst and somnolence. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed, but none were symptomatic or resulted in an adverse event. Drug levels at all doses tested in the trial, including the lowest dose, were well above those believed to be needed to stimulate the CB2 receptor.
 In April 2015, we announced favorable top-line results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial enrolled 56 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of olorinab. Dose-responsive exposure was observed over the explored dose range of 10-400 mg with good tolerability at all doses administered.
 Olorinab Intellectual Property 
 As of February 15, 2019, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for olorinab and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing olorinab and related compounds, in 21 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and we had applications pending in 10 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Venezuela, Brazil and India. Patents on olorinab issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office include serial numbers US 8,778,950 and US 9,944,606. We also own issued patents and/or pending applications directed to various solid-state forms of olorinab, and other methods of treatment utilizing olorinab. The earliest priority date for the patents on olorinab is 2009. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2030 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
APD418 Program
 APD418 is a potential first-in-class calcium-independent myofilament derepressor, or CMD, in development for the treatment of decompensated heart failure, or DHF. 
 DHF is a clinical syndrome of new or worsening signs and symptoms of chronic heart failure, often leading to hospitalization or a visit to the emergency department. DHF is an area of high unmet medical need affecting a heterogeneous population with high post-discharge readmission rates and significant morbidity and mortality. Projections of decompensated heart failure forecast 9.5 million hospitalizations annually by 2025 in major markets worldwide. Approximately 70% of patients are readmitted within one year of the first treatment and patients experience a 20% increased mortality with each rehospitalization. The current in-hospital standard of care for DHF aims to improve hemodynamic status with drugs that increase cardiac contractility (inotropes) via modulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor, or AdrR, pathway. However, treatment with currently approved inotropes targeting beta1/beta2 adrenergic pathways has been associated with adverse effects on blood pressure and heart rate and result in increased long-term mortality.
 APD418 is a beta3 AdrR antagonist, with no action on beta1/beta2 AdrRs. Beta3 AdrR upregulation and activation in DHF has been shown to decrease cardiac contractility, thus inhibition of beta3 with APD418 potentially represents a novel mechanism to improve contractility without the adverse hemodynamic and chronotropic changes associated with current inotropes that put stress on the heart. We are currently preparing an investigational new drug, or IND, application enabling package.
 Additional Internal Preclinical and Clinical Programs 
 We have additional clinical and preclinical assets, including temanogrel and APD597, which we are evaluating for future development. We are also evaluating additional delivery forms of the products in our pipeline to extend clinical utility or improve the product profile.
Collaborations and License Agreements 
 In addition to our primary focus on developing our proprietary, unencumbered clinical pipeline, we have strategic collaborations and licenses with pharmaceutical companies, including United Therapeutics, Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, Outpost Medicine, LLC, or Outpost Medicine, Beacon Discovery, Inc., or Beacon, and Eisai.

United Therapeutics License Agreement
 In November 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with United Therapeutics. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we granted United Therapeutics an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize ralinepag. This transaction was completed on January 24, 2019. At the closing of the transaction, we transferred to United Therapeutics certain other assets relating to ralinepag, including, among others, related domain names and trademarks, permits, certain contracts, inventory, regulatory documentation, IND, and non-clinical, pre-clinical and clinical trial data. United Therapeutics has agreed to assume certain limited liabilities, including, among others, all post-closing obligations under assumed contracts and the IND. United Therapeutics is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products globally. 
 Upon the closing of this transaction, in January 2019, we received an upfront payment of $800.0 million. We are eligible to receive a payment of $150.0 million upon first marketing approval of ralinepag in a major non-US market, and a payment of $250.0 million upon US marketing approval of an inhaled formulation of ralinepag. In addition, we are entitled to receive low double-digit, tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag products, subject to certain adjustments for third party license payments. 
 The United Therapeutics Agreement contains various representations and warranties of Arena and United Therapeutics, and various covenants of the parties, including covenants to cooperate in seeking regulatory approvals, as well as our agreement not to compete, during the period in which royalties are payable (or during the five-year period following the closing if we are subject to a change of control transaction) in the development of a prostacyclin to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. 
 Ralinepag Program
 Ralinepag is a next-generation potent, highly selective oral IP receptor agonist intended for the treatment of PAH. Ralinepag was designed by us to deliver intravenous prostacyclin-like potency and pharmacokinetics in an oral tablet. In non-clinical experiments, ralinepag demonstrated potentially best-in-class activation of the IP receptor resulting in vasodilation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Additionally, early stage studies of ralinepag pharmacokinetics in humans revealed an approximately 24-hour half-life and a low peak-to-trough ratio supporting therapeutic blood levels with once daily dosing.  
 Ralinepag was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of PAH by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in September 2014, and by the European Medicines Agency in January 2019. 
 PAH is a progressive, life-threatening disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when the pulmonary arteries thicken or grow rigid. This makes blood flow more difficult. The heart must work harder to push blood through the arteries, and the arteries are unable to carry adequate blood to the lungs. The increased pressure strains the heart, which can limit physical activity, result in heart failure and reduce life expectancy. PAH will continue to worsen over time, even with proper treatment. Based on data from the Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH disease management, or REVEAL, of patients in the US, there is an estimated five-year survival rate of 57% from diagnosis.
PAH involves several interrelated mechanisms, with prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 playing a major role in maintaining pulmonary vascular tone through their balanced activity. Prostacyclin, released by endothelial cells, promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin also has antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle. Despite treatment guidelines, targeting the prostacyclin pathway has been primarily reserved for patients with advanced disease due to limitations of currently available options including parenteral prostacyclins which are the only PAH treatment that have demonstrated a mortality benefit.
 Ralinepag Development
 In 2018, we announced positive data from a planned interim analysis of the ongoing open-label extension of the Phase 2 trial of ralinepag in development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
 In 2017, we announced topline results from a 22-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the effectiveness in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, improving exercise capacity, tolerability and safety of ralinepag. In this trial, 40 patients with PAH received ralinepag and 21 received placebo. Topline results showed statistically significant improvement of both absolute and percentage change from baseline in PVR. Ralinepag also demonstrated numerical improvement in six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, but as the study was not powered to show a difference in 6MWD from placebo, this was a not a statistically-significant finding. The safety and tolerability profiles were in line with other oral prostacyclins. 
 8


In 2013, we announced topline results from a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating multiple-ascending doses of ralinepag in healthy volunteers. In this trial, 40 healthy volunteers received ralinepag and 15 received placebo. The safety profile of ralinepag in this trial was characteristic of IP receptor agonists: the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, nausea and jaw pain. One serious adverse event, transient atrial fibrillation, occurred in a single subject, and the study investigator considered it to be possibly treatment related. Further review revealed that the subject had multiple characteristics predisposing the patient to atrial fibrillation, including cardiac abnormalities prior to study start.
 In 2011, we announced topline results of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of ralinepag. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated 32 healthy volunteers in four cohorts of eight participants each, with six randomized to ralinepag and two to placebo. Ralinepag was rapidly absorbed and demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetic exposure over the tested dose range. Consistent with the expected pharmacology of ralinepag, the most common adverse events were headache, vomiting, nausea, jaw pain and flushing.
 Everest Collaboration
 In December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest regarding the development and commercialization of ralinepag and etrasimod in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. In January 2019, we and Everest amended the Everest Agreement by entering into two separate agreements, one for each of ralinepag and etrasimod, with the terms for each program that are substantially the same as in the original Everest Agreement. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we assigned the separate Everest Agreement related to ralinepag to United Therapeutics.  
 Under the separate Everest Agreement related to etrasimod, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in the Everest Territories.
 Everest is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. 
 In addition to an upfront payment of $12.0 million, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest of up to $115.0 million, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the National Medical Products Administration of China, formerly known as the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, accepted the initial clinical trial applications for an oral formulation of ralinepag and for etrasimod.
 Boehringer Ingelheim Collaboration
In 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, to conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting a GPCR that belongs to a group of orphan central nervous system, or CNS, receptors. An “orphan receptor” is structurally related to a family of proteins that are known to act as functional cell-surface receptors but whose ligand has not yet been identified. In December 2018, Boehringer Ingelheim opted to start the preclinical development of the subject compound.
 We contracted with Beacon to perform our research obligations under the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In exchange, we agreed to share limited near-term milestones with Beacon as well as the full-time equivalent funding paid to us by Boehringer Ingelheim. We have retained the longer-term success milestones and all royalties. 
 Outpost Medicine License Agreement
 In 2017, we entered into a research study and option to license agreement with Outpost Medicine, LLC, or Outpost Medicine. In 2018, Outpost Medicine exercised its option to enter into a licensing agreement with us to advance an undisclosed, preclinical compound with potential utility in treating genitourinary disorders. We received an upfront fee comprised of cash and equity totaling $3.0 million and are eligible to receive $96.5 million in development and commercial milestone payments and up to low double-digit tiered royalties on annual net sales of the compound.
Beacon Discovery Agreements 
 In September 2016, we entered into a series of agreements with Beacon. Beacon was founded and is owned by several of our former employees. 
 9


We entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which we granted Beacon a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-sublicensable license to certain database information relating to compounds, receptors and pharmacology, and transferred certain equipment to Beacon. Beacon will seek to engage global partners to facilitate discovery and development. Beacon has agreed to assign to us any intellectual property relating to our existing research and development programs developed in the course of performing research for us, and grant us a non-exclusive license to any intellectual property developed outside the course of performing work for us that is reasonably necessary or useful for developing or commercializing the products under our research and development programs. We are also entitled to rights of negotiation and rights of first refusal to potentially obtain licenses to certain compounds discovered and developed by Beacon. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a percentage of any revenue received by Beacon on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement from any third party pursuant to a third-party license, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties; (ii) single-digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of any related products sold by Beacon and its affiliates; and (iii) in the event that Beacon is sold, a percentage of the consideration for such sale transaction.
 We also entered a Master Services Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which Beacon performs certain research services for us relating to our proprietary pipeline, as well as a services agreement to support our research obligations under our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.
 BELVIQ (lorcaserin) Agreement
 Lorcaserin is approved for marketing in the United States, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, and Taiwan for the indication of weight management, and is being commercialized by Eisai or its distributors in the United States, South Korea, Israel, and Taiwan. BELVIQ was made available by prescription in the United States in June 2013 and in South Korea in February 2015. Eisai also has launched of a once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States, which is marketed under the brand name BELVIQ XR. Lorcaserin has not yet been launched in Brazil or Mexico. In December 2016, we entered into a Transaction Agreement and a Supply Agreement with Eisai, which replaced our prior marketing and supply agreement with Eisai for lorcaserin. In 2018, Eisai reported positive top line results from CAMELLIA-TIMI61, a long-term cardiovascular outcome trial of lorcaserin.
 Transaction Agreement
 Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we granted Eisai an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, or transferred intellectual property, to develop, manufacture and commercialize lorcaserin in all countries and territories of the world. In consideration for the rights granted to Eisai under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai has agreed to make tiered royalty payments to us on the net sales of lorcaserin. The royalty rates range from 9.5% on annual global net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million, 13.5% on annual global net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million and 18.5% on annual global net sales greater than $500.0 million.
 We are eligible to receive a milestone payment of $25.0 million upon the achievement of global net sales of lorcaserin for a calendar year first exceeding $250.0 million.
 Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with the development of lorcaserin. Eisai has the exclusive right and responsibility to plan and implement all research and development of lorcaserin at its own cost and expense, including conducting all regulatory activities and all clinical and development activities. 
 Eisai is solely responsible, and has the exclusive rights, for commercializing lorcaserin and is responsible for manufacturing lorcaserin. Eisai is responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize lorcaserin products in the United States, as well as to develop, seek regulatory approval and commercialize lorcaserin products in the European Union, China and Japan.

On March 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Sale Agreement, with Siegfried Pharma AG and Siegfried AG, collectively and individually, Siegfried. Under the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell and assign to Siegfried, and Siegfried agreed to purchase and assume from our subsidiary Arena Pharmaceuticals GmbH, or Arena GmbH, certain drug product finishing facility assets and know-how, including fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets located in Zofingen, Switzerland and related contracts and certain related liabilities, or collectively, the Manufacturing Operations. We refer to this transaction as the Siegfried Transaction. The Siegfried Transaction was completed on March 31, 2018. In connection with the Siegfried Transaction, all of Arena GmbH’s approximately 50 employees transferred to Siegfried.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of treatment.
 There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications for potential abandonment that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates will likely be substantially less than 20 years.
 In the United States, patent term adjustment is available for certain delays in patent office proceedings. In addition, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits patent term restoration of a US patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. The application for PTE is subject to approval by the PTO in conjunction with the FDA.
 Outside of the United States, similar provisions may be available in the European Union, Japan, South Korea and some other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The length of any such extension would vary by country. Our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection certificates of up to five years in one or more countries.
 Due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, and invention disclosure procedures as a condition of employment. Additionally, our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements require that our employees not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third-party proprietary technology. We also generally require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.

Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change. We face significant competition from many organizations with drugs or drug candidates that do or may compete drug candidates we are developing. We may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Developments by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, and we or our collaborators may not be successful in developing either first or best in class drugs.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial, scientific and marketing resources than we do. Additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research, development, marketing and promotion of therapeutic products or drug discovery techniques, or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving regulatory approval or commercializing drugs before we do.
 We expect to encounter significant competition in the therapeutic areas targeted by our principal drug candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing, marketing, distribution and selling capabilities, and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have longer histories of safe and effective use.
 We may rely on collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates. Such collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us, which may negatively impact the development of drugs that are subject to our agreements. In addition, we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaboration arrangements, and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships.
 Government Regulation
 We and our collaborators are subject to significant governmental regulation. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, tracking, recordkeeping, advertising, pricing and promotion of drug candidates and commercialized drugs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in inspectional notices of violation, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of a product from the market or other negative consequences.
 In the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, many of which are required to be performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, generally accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs may be subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial expertise, time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular drug candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The initial IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, following its initial safety review. During the 30-day time period the FDA may require additional information. The FDA may institute a clinical hold at the 30-day time period if any questions are not fully addressed or because of other concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may place an IND on partial or full clinical hold at any time during a product candidate’s development. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 Clinical trials. For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, typically in healthy volunteers, but in some cases in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies or adequate and well-controlled studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a drug candidate but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 New drug applications. The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. An NDA is usually accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission by the NDA sponsor. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months from its acceptance of the filing or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from its acceptance of the filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that may limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs or other information.
 13


Other US regulatory requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection or after the appropriate FDA office review of the Establishment Inspection Report prepared by the investigator, can list conditions the FDA believes may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued for violations of “regulatory significance,” also known as Official Action Indicated, or OAI. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in regulatory action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, recall of product, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for healthcare professional marketing activities and materials, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the confines of the pivotal studies and the approved label. Further, we may be required to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA for changes to, among other things, the indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities of a drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, corrective advertising, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA, if in their professional medical judgment, the physicians deem such use to be appropriate. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 To distribute products commercially, we or our collaborators, as applicable, must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution.
 Drug Enforcement Administration regulation. The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance based on an evaluation of its abuse potential, and scheduling by the DEA is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled drug are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of any DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act can delay the submission or approval of applications seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved NDA. A new chemical entity, or NCE, subject to an NDA is entitled to a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of patents listed with the FDA by the NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-
 14


year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication or the same product for the same indication if demonstrated to be clinically superior. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Outside of the United States
Outside of the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. Approval in the United States does not guarantee approval in other countries and vice-versa.
 Prescription drug reimbursement. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of prescription drug products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are less likely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are important to new product acceptance.
 If a drug is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort, which has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage 
 15


policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States in March 2010 and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In the case of BELVIQ, Medicare explicitly excludes coverage of drugs for weight loss.
 In countries outside the United States, pricing of pharmaceutical products may be subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product’s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. Some countries operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare fraud and abuse. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or provide any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, service or item, including the prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use” or “the practice of medicine,” if deemed appropriate in the physicians’ professional medical judgment. The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other government agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications.
 There are numerous federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws that forbid, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for 
 16


reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions, including individual imprisonment, disgorgement, criminal fines and civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, under certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Additionally, many states have analogous fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. The federal transparency requirements under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Additionally, recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on certain pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, regarding drug product tracking and tracing.
 Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
 Healthcare privacy and security laws. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information. We may be subject to, or our collaborators’ marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA and its implementing regulations. In addition, the European Union has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to Directive 95/46/EC, or the Data Protection Directive. The Data Protection Directive will be replaced starting in May 2018 with the recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. We may in the future expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU, including potentially conducting preclinical and clinical trials. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which operate.
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 Manufacturing, Revenues from External Customers, and Sources and Availability of Materials
 Our revenues of $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, included $6.6 million from Eisai, $4.4 million from Boehringer Ingelheim, $2.8 million from Outpost Medicine, $2.2 million from Axovant, and $2.0 million from Everest. Our revenues of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, included $12.0 million from Everest, $5.1 million from Boehringer Ingelheim and $1.7 million from Eisai. Our revenues of $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, included $78.4 million from Eisai, $5.1 million from Boehringer Ingelheim and $4.2 million from Ildong. This information excludes revenue activity reported within discontinued operations. See Note 5 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. We do not currently engage in manufacturing activities and we are not dependent on availability of materials for our core business operations.

Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the CSA and other federal, state or local regulations.
 We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.

Item
 1A.    Risk Factors.
 Investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our stock. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.
Risks Relating to Our Business
 Drug development programs are expensive, time consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, interruption, delay or termination.
 Drug development programs are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Our drug candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in research and development. Clinical trials and preclinical studies are needed to demonstrate that drug candidates are safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA, and similar non-US regulatory authorities, and the FDA or other regulatory authority may require us to, or we or others may decide to, conduct additional research and development even after a drug is approved. The commencement or completion of our clinical trials or preclinical studies could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including the following:

• | limited number of, and competition for, suitable patients required for enrollment in our clinical trials or animals to conduct our preclinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials or preclinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay or failure to obtain a meeting, approval or agreement from the applicable regulatory authority to commence a clinical trial or approval of a study protocol;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of drug candidates, drugs or other materials for the trial or study;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable agreement terms or protocols; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay or failure to obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, recruitment for the indications in our ongoing and planned clinical studies is competitive and challenging, and it is difficult to predict when such trials will be fully enrolled or when data will be available.
 18


In addition, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, collaborators, or we may suspend, delay or terminate our development programs at any time for various reasons, including those listed above affecting the commencement or completion of trials and the following:
  
• | side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of effectiveness of any drug candidate during clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment or lower than expected patient retention rates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or compound formulation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study, or “clinical holds,” or delays requiring suspension or termination of a study by a regulatory authority, such as the FDA, after a study is commenced;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncertainty regarding proper dosing;
--+-------------------------------------


• | unfavorable results from ongoing clinical trials or preclinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure of our clinical research organizations to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | insufficient data to support regulatory approval;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | termination of clinical trials at one or more clinical trial sites;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of sufficient funding to continue clinical trials or preclinical studies; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in business priorities or perceptions of the value of the program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials, and many companies have experienced significant setbacks in advanced development programs even after promising results in earlier studies or trials. We have experienced setbacks in our internal and partnered development programs and expect to experience additional setbacks from time to time in the future. In addition, even if the earlier-stage results of our development programs are favorable, these programs may take significantly longer than expected to complete or may not be completed at all. If we or our collaborators abandon or are delayed in our development efforts related to any drug or drug candidate, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our operations at the current or planned level or be profitable, our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged, additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms we or others believe are favorable, and our stock price may decrease significantly.
 We may not be successful in initiating, enrolling patients in, or completing our studies or trials or advancing our programs on our projected timetable, if at all. Any failure to initiate or delays in our studies, trials or development programs, or unfavorable results or decisions or negative perceptions regarding any of our programs, could cause our stock price to decline significantly. This is particularly the case with respect to our clinical programs. 
 We will need to obtain additional funds or enter into collaboration agreements to execute on our corporate strategy, and we may not be able to do so at all or on terms you view as favorable; your ownership may be substantially diluted if we do obtain additional funds; you may not agree with the manner in which we allocate our available resources; and we may not be profitable.
 It takes many years and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to successfully develop a compound into a marketed drug. We have accumulated a large deficit that has primarily resulted from the significant expenditures we have made in research and development since our inception. We expect that our losses and operating expenses will continue to be substantial.
 All of our internal programs are in the development stage, and we may not have adequate funds to develop all of our compounds into marketed drugs.
 19


We may seek to obtain additional funding through the capital markets or other financing sources. Additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms we or others believe are favorable. Our ability to obtain additional funding may depend on many factors, including those outside our control. Should we obtain additional funding, your ownership interest may be diluted or otherwise negatively impacted.
 We may enter into collaboration or other agreements with other entities to continue to develop and, if successful, commercialize one or more of our drug candidates. We may not be able to enter into any such agreements on terms that we or third parties, including investors or analysts, view as favorable, if at all. Our ability to enter into any such agreement for any of our programs or drug candidates depends on many factors, potentially including the outcomes of additional testing (including clinical trial results) or regulatory applications for marketing approval, and we do not control these outcomes.
 We may allocate our resources in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our assets, and our stockholders and others may also not agree with the manner in which we choose to allocate our resources or obtain additional funding. We may also eliminate, scale back or delay some or all of our research and development programs, and any such reductions or failure to apply our resources effectively or to obtain additional funding could narrow, slow or otherwise adversely impact the development and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates, which could reduce our opportunities for success and have a material adverse effect on our business, our prospects and the market price of our common stock. 
 In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or, if we are profitable for any particular time period, that we will be profitable in the future.
 Our business may be negatively impacted based on the clinical trials and preclinical studies of, and decisions affecting, one or more of our drug candidates.
 The results and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies, as well as related decisions by us, collaborators and regulators, can affect our stock price. Results of clinical trials and preclinical studies are uncertain and subject to different interpretations by regulatory agencies, us or others. The design of these trials and studies (which may change significantly and be more expensive than anticipated depending on results and regulatory decisions), as well as related analyses of such results, including adverse effects, may not be viewed favorably by us or third parties, including investors, analysts, current or potential collaborators, the academic and medical communities, and regulators, which could adversely impact the development and opportunities for regulatory approval of drug candidates and commercialization (and even result in withdrawal from the market) of approved drugs. The same may be true of decisions regarding the focus and prioritization of our research and development efforts. Stock prices of companies in our industry have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived negatively or when a drug candidate or product did not otherwise meet expectations.
 The development, approval or commercialization of any of our drug candidates could be negatively affected by circumstances related to other drug candidates or approved products.
 Information on our drug candidates in clinical development is preliminary and incomplete, and for such drug candidates, particularly in the earlier stages of development, information on approved products in the same or related drug classes may indicate potential risks related to the development of our drug candidates. For example, etrasimod is an orally available modulator of the S1P receptors. An approved drug that is also an orally available modulator of the S1P receptors, Gilenya, is associated with risks such as adverse cardiovascular effects, including lowering of the heart rate and heart blocks, infection, macular edema, respiratory effects, fetal risk, a rare brain infection, and elevations in liver enzymes. These adverse reactions and risks may be associated with S1P receptor modulation and could be found to be associated with the use of etrasimod. Such adverse reactions and risks, either actual or perceived, could negatively impact its development, approval or commercialization, or our ability to enter into a collaboration on acceptable terms.
 Topline data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.
 We may publicly disclose topline or interim data from time to time, which are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial.
 20


We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular drug candidate or drug and our company in general. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business.
 Our hypothesis that selectively targeting receptors can lead to more efficacious or safer drugs may not be correct.
 In general, we have designed and optimized the drug candidates that we or our collaborators and licensees are developing (including etrasimod, ralinepag and olorinab) to selectively target certain receptors found on cells in humans. Our hypothesis is that selectivity may allow our drug candidates to address diseases more efficaciously or without some of the negative effects associated with less selective drugs. In certain cases, we believe early research and, if available, early clinical testing, provides preliminary support for our hypothesis. However, our hypothesis may not be correct, early research and early phase clinical testing may not be predictive of efficacy or safety in later trials, and our drug candidates may not be approved or, if approved, have the desired efficacy or safety profile.
 It is generally our strategy to develop drug candidates that we believe will be first-in-class, best-in-class, or similar descriptions, or otherwise have broad clinical utility, optimized pharmacology or optimized pharmacokinetics. Some or all of our drug candidates may not achieve these goals. For example, failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials on schedule or at all could prevent a drug candidate from being first-in-class. Similarly, comparing data from different trials, or making predictions based on preclinical data, may not allow us to correctly determine whether our drug candidates are superior to competitive drugs or drug candidates in the same way that comparisons can be made from conducting trials in which our and a competitive drug is tested “head to head” in the same trial. The failure of our drugs or drug candidates to be first-in-class, best-in-class, or similar descriptions, or have broad clinical utility, optimized pharmacology, or optimized pharmacokinetics, could adversely affect development, regulatory approval, third-party payor support, or market adoption, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.
 The results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates or any approved drugs may not be further developed or have favorable results in later studies or trials.
 Preclinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate, but rather to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to understand the drug candidate’s side effects at various doses and schedules. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be confirmed in later studies or trials, including preclinical studies that continue or that are initiated after earlier clinical trials and large-scale clinical trials, and our drug candidates or drugs in subsequent trials or studies may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier-stage trials. For example, we have announced positive topline Phase 2 results for etrasimod in patients with ulcerative colitis, but these results may not be confirmed in any subsequent Phase 3 study. By way of another example, the impact of etrasimod on heart rate that was observed in completed clinical trials may not be observed in subsequent trials, and it could be viewed negatively by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. 
 Unfavorable results from clinical trials or preclinical studies could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials, or abandonment of a program. Clinical and preclinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during such trials or studies could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated; a program to be abandoned; or negatively impact a related marketed drug, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Drug discovery and development is intensely competitive in the therapeutic areas on which we focus. If the number of our competitors increase or they develop treatments that are approved faster, marketed better, less expensive or demonstrated to be more effective or safer than our drugs or drug candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.
 Many of the drugs we or our collaborators are attempting or may attempt to discover and develop may compete with existing therapies in the United States and other territories. In addition, many companies are pursuing the development of new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we target. For example, with regard to etrasimod, there are other drugs that have a similar mechanism of action that entered Phase 3 clinical development before etrasimod for the same indications that we are pursuing, such as ulcerative colitis. 
 21


Our competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have substantially greater research, development and marketing and sales capabilities and greater financial, scientific and human resources than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do for the same indication may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including certain patent and marketing exclusivity rights. In addition, our competitors’ drugs may have fewer side effects, more desirable characteristics (such as efficacy, route of administration or frequency of dosing), or be viewed more favorably by patients, healthcare providers, healthcare payers, the medical community, the media or others than our drug candidates or drugs, if any, for the same indication. Our competitors may also market generic or other drugs that compete with our drugs at a lower price than our drugs, which may negatively impact our drug sales, if any. Any results from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators, may not compete successfully with existing or newly discovered products or therapies.
 Our revenues in the future will be substantially dependent on the success of our or our collaborators’ and licensees’ marketing of drugs we have discovered or developed. To the extent such drugs are not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock may decline. 
 We believe our revenues will be substantially dependent on the success of the drugs we or our collaborators and licensees successfully develop. We do not know whether or when such drug candidates will be approved by regulatory authorities for sale or commercialized. Even if approved and commercialization begins, we do not know if such commercialization will be successful or otherwise meet our, your, analysts’ or others’ expectations, and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. For example, sales of lorcaserin to date have been less than we and others initially anticipated. Lorcaserin is the only approved and marketed drug in which we have a financial interest. Our future revenue for the near-term is substantially dependent on our license and partnership agreements. 
 We cannot guarantee future product sales or achievement of milestones under our collaborations and license agreements. For example, our license agreement with United Therapeutics for ralinepag does not contain a covenant obligating United Therapeutics to use any particular efforts to develop or commercialize any product, and we may never receive any milestone or royalty payments under this license agreement. In addition, our Transaction Agreement with Eisai for lorcaserin, and our other collaborations, may be terminated early in certain circumstances, which may result in us not receiving additional milestone or other payments under the terminated agreement.
 The degree of market acceptance and commercial success of a drug will depend on a number of factors, including the following, as well as risks identified in other risk factors:
  
• | the number of patients treated with the drug and their results;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | market acceptance and use of the drug, which may depend on the public’s view of the drug, economic changes, national and world events, potentially seasonal and other fluctuations in demand, the timing and impact of current or new competition, and the drug’s perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments (including relative convenience, ease of administration, and prevalence and severity of any adverse events, including any unexpected adverse events);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the actual and perceived safety and efficacy of the drug on both a short- and long-term basis among actual or potential patients, healthcare providers and others in the medical community, regulatory agencies and insurers and other payers, including related decisions by any such entity or individual;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | incidence and severity of any side effects, including as a result of off-label use or in combination with one or more drugs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new data relating to the drug, including as a result of additional studies, trials or analyses of the drug or related drugs or drug candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the willingness of physicians to prescribe and of patients to use the drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the claims, limitations, warnings and other information in the drug’s current or future labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any current or future scheduling designation for the drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, or any comparable foreign authorities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our or our collaborators’ maintenance of an effective sales force, marketing team, strategy and program, and medical affairs group and related functions, as well as its sales, marketing and other representatives accurately describing the drug consistent with its approved labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the price and perceived cost-effectiveness of the drug, including as compared to possible alternatives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | the ability of patients and physicians and other providers to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement, if any, by third-party payers, including government payers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability and desire of group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, including distributors and other network providers, to sell the drug to their constituencies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | introduction of counterfeit or unauthorized versions of the drug;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to the extent the drug is approved and marketed in a jurisdiction with a significantly lower price than in another jurisdiction, the impact of the lower pricing in the higher-priced territory, including on the pricing of reimbursement, if available, and by the diversion of lower-priced of the drug into the higher-priced territory; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of adequate commercial manufacturing and supply chain for the drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our drugs may not be commercially successful if not widely covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payers, and we may depend on others to obtain and maintain third-party payer access; inadequate third-party coverage and reimbursement could make entering into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs more difficult and diminish our revenues.
 Our and our collaborators’ and licensee’s ability to successfully commercialize any of our drugs that have been or may be approved will depend, in part, on government regulation and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including private health insurers and government payers, such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, increases in government-run, single-payer health insurance plans and compulsory licenses of drugs. We expect government and third-party payers will continue their efforts to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs. In addition, many countries outside of the United States have nationalized healthcare systems in which the government pays for all such products and services and must approve product pricing. A government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements, for our drugs, if any, could limit market acceptance of and demand for our drugs.
 It is increasingly difficult to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payers, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement of newly approved prescription drug products. We or our collaborators also face competition in negotiating for coverage from pharmaceutical companies and others with competitive drugs or other treatment, and these competitors may have significantly more negotiating leverage or success with respect to individual payers than we or our collaborators may have.
 Federal and state healthcare reform measures that have been or may be implemented in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, more limited coverage and downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product, which could seriously decrease our future revenues. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or the ACA, which was enacted in 2010, is one such healthcare reform measure that has made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative, executive, and judicial activity around, attempts to repeal, replace, or modify the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business and operations. 
 Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States and other countries of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. In the United States, such scrutiny has resulted in congressional 
 23


inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. For example, reimbursement has been challenging for BELVIQ, including because Medicare explicitly excludes coverage for drugs for weight loss. The implementation of additional cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may also limit our commercial opportunities by reducing the amount a potential collaborator or licensee is willing to pay to license our programs or drug candidates in the future, which may prevent us from being able to establish and maintain collaborations and license agreements, generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. 
 Forecasting potential sales for drugs will be difficult, and if our projections are inaccurate, our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected.
 Our business planning requires us to forecast or make assumptions regarding demand and revenues for our drugs if they are approved despite numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties may be increased if we rely on our collaborators to conduct commercial activities and provide us with accurate and timely information. Actual results may deviate materially from projected results for various reasons, including the following, as well as risks identified in other risk factors:
  
• | the rate of adoption in the particular market, including fluctuations in demand for various reasons, such as fluctuations related to economic changes, national and world events, holidays and seasonal changes;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pricing (including discounting or other promotions), reimbursement, product returns or recalls, competition, labeling, DEA scheduling, adverse events and other items that impact commercialization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of patient and physician familiarity with the drug;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of patient use and physician prescribing history;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | lack of commercialization experience with the drug;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | actual sales to patients may significantly differ from expectations based on sales to wholesalers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncertainty relating to when the drug may become commercially available to patients and rate of adoption in other territories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Revenues from drug sales may be based in part on estimates, judgment and accounting policies, and incorrect estimates or regulators’ or others’ disagreement regarding such estimates or accounting policies may result in changes to guidance, projections or previously reported results. Expected and actual product sales and quarterly and other results may greatly fluctuate, and such fluctuations can adversely affect the market price of our common stock, perceptions of our ability to forecast demand and revenues, and our ability to maintain and fund our operations.
 Our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain key and other employees.
 Our success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management, development and scientific personnel, and the ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. We face competition for such personnel, and we believe that risks and uncertainties related to our business may impact our ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. If we do not recruit and retain effective management and other key employees, particularly our executive officers, our operations, our ability to generate or raise additional capital, and our business in general may be adversely impacted. For example, to execute our clinical programs, our strategy is to maintain a sufficient and robust clinical expertise and program management function. We are in the process of modifying and building this function, and we may not be able to establish the function we believe necessary to support our clinical goals and meet our corporate objectives.
 We are expanding our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.
 We are seeking to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific, operational, manufacturing supply, commercial, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors, including in and outside of headquarters in San Diego, California. For example, in addition to our headquarters in San Diego, we currently have operations in Zug, Switzerland, and Boston, Massachusetts. Future growth will impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other 
 24


projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. Moreover, if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and then commercialize any approved products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.
 Data generated or analyzed with respect to product use in the market or required postmarketing or other studies or trials may result in decreased demand, lower sales, product recall, regulatory action or litigation.
 An NDA holder (or the equivalent outside the United States) is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of a drug that has been approved for marketing, including reviewing reports of adverse safety events. In addition, NDA holders often conduct additional studies or trials or analyze new or previous data related to an approved drug, including with respect to required postmarketing studies and in connection with seeking additional regulatory approvals in new territories. 
 Any new data generated, including from adverse event reports or required postmarketing, registration or other studies or trials, may result in label changes, adversely affect sales or development, result in withdrawal of the drug from the market, or result in litigation. In addition, analyses of previous data can have similar risks. Regulatory agencies may consider the new data or analyses in reviewing marketing applications for lorcaserin in their territories or impose post-approval requirements that require significant additional expenditures. Furthermore, the discovery of significant problems with a product or class of products similar to any approved drug could have an adverse effect on our or our collaborator’s or licensee’s commercialization.
 The commercialization and continuing development of lorcaserin may be adversely impacted by cardiovascular side effects associated with drugs used for the treatment of obesity.
 We developed lorcaserin to more selectively stimulate the serotonin 2C receptor than did fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine because we believe this may avoid the cardiovascular side effects associated with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (often used in combination with phentermine, the combination of which was commonly referred to as “fen-phen”). These two drugs were serotonin-releasing agents and non-selective serotonin receptor agonists, and were withdrawn from the market in 1997 after reported incidences of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension associated with their usage.
 We may not be correct in our belief that more selectively stimulating the serotonin 2C receptor will avoid these undesired side effects, or lorcaserin’s selectivity profile may not be adequate to avoid these side effects. The safety issues that have affected other weight loss drugs may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of the safety of lorcaserin, may raise potential adverse publicity and may affect product sales or result in litigation.
 If we license or otherwise partner our drugs, our failure to maintain such agreements or poor performance under such agreements could negatively impact our business.
 Our collaborators and licensees may have primary responsibility for the regulatory approval and, ultimately, marketing and distribution of our drug candidate in the territory or territories under the applicable collaboration. We may have limited or no control over the amount and timing of resources that any of these collaborators will dedicate to such activities. This is the case for our ralinepag exclusive license agreement with United Therapeutics and our lorcaserin Transaction Agreement with Eisai.
 When we enter collaboration and license agreements, we are subject to a number of other risks, including:
  
• | our collaborators and licensees may not comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, which could adversely impact the commercialization or development of the drug candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | there could be disagreements regarding the agreements or the study or development that delay or terminate the commercialization, research, study or development, delay or eliminate potential payments under the agreements or increase our costs under or outside of the agreements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our collaborators and licensees may not effectively allocate adequate resources or may have limited experience in a particular territory; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our collaborators and licensees may not perform as expected, including with regard to making any required payments, and the agreements may not provide adequate protection or may not be effectively enforced.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We or our collaborators or licensees might terminate our agreements in certain circumstances or amend the terms of our agreement, and investors and analysts may not view any termination or amendments as favorable.
 25


We rely on other companies, including third-party manufacturers and sole-source suppliers, to manufacture all our drugs and drug candidates, and we or such other companies may encounter failures or difficulties or not receive or provide adequate supply, which could adversely affect development or commercialization.
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities that can produce active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, intermediates and other material required to make our drug candidates or lorcaserin. Instead, we rely on other companies to supply API, intermediates and other materials. Certain of these materials are available from only one or a small number of suppliers, and using a new supplier, if available, could result in substantial delay and greater cost. Our and our manufacturers’ dependence on single or limited sources of materials may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver drug products on a timely and competitive basis, or at all.
 Any performance failure on the part of us or a third-party manufacturer could result in a product recall or seizure, delay or otherwise adversely affect sales of an approved product or the clinical development or regulatory approval of lorcaserin or one or more of our other drug candidates. We or third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, regulatory compliance, lot release, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. 
 The ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply drug product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the manufacturing facilities, which is impacted by many manufacturing variables, including:
  
• | availability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capacity of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | having the ability to adjust to changes in actual or anticipated use of the facility, including with respect to having sufficient capacity and a sufficient number of qualified personnel;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses or cross contamination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with regulatory requirements, including inspectional notices of violation and warning letters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintenance and renewal of any required licenses or certifications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in actual or forecasted demand;
--+----------------------------------------


• | timing and number of production runs;
--+--------------------------------------


• | production success rates and bulk drug yields; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | timing and outcome of product quality testing.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 In addition, we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter delays and problems in manufacturing our drug candidates or drugs for a variety of reasons, including accidents during operation, failure of equipment, delays in receiving materials, natural or other disasters, political or governmental unrest or changes, social unrest, intentional misconduct or other factors inherent in operating complex manufacturing facilities. Commercially available starting materials, reagents and excipients may be or become scarce or more expensive to procure, and we may not be able to obtain favorable terms in agreements with subcontractors. We or our third-party manufacturers may not be able to operate our respective manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs. If we or our third-party manufacturers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party manufacturers and other service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, such interruption could delay progress on our programs, or interrupt the commercial supply, with the potential for additional costs and lost revenues. If this were to occur, we may also need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs.
 We may not be able to enter into or maintain agreements with manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply with applicable law. Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspection (which may be unannounced) by the FDA, the DEA, corresponding state and foreign authorities and other regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, regulations and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with these regulations and standards. If we or one of our manufacturers or other company in the supply chain fail to maintain compliance or otherwise experience setbacks, we or they could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, the production of one or more of our drug candidates or lorcaserin could be interrupted or suspended, or our product could be recalled or withdrawn, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues.
 Our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation, and we may not receive required regulatory approvals, or timely approvals, for any of our drug candidates.
 Preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, and other activities relating to developing and manufacturing drugs are subject to extensive 
 26


regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We and others we contract with are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA, the DEA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions that may negatively impact research and development or commercialization, or otherwise negatively impact our business. Regulatory agencies have in the past inspected certain aspects of our business, and we were provided with observations of objectionable conditions or practices with respect to our business. There is no assurance that regulatory agencies will not provide us with observations in future inspections or that we satisfactorily addressed observations provided to us in past inspections.
 Regulatory approval of a drug candidate is not guaranteed, and our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Despite the time and expense exerted in preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 We cannot predict when or whether, or assure you that, our collaborators’ or our past or any future regulatory submissions or responses will be sufficient to the applicable regulatory authority or others, that the applicable regulatory authority or others will consider data or our analyses, interpretations or procedures related to any of our drug candidates as sufficient or persuasive, or that any regulatory authority will ever approve any of our drug candidates in the future.
 To market any drugs outside of the United States, we and our current or future collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as additional risks, some of which may be unanticipated. The approval by the FDA or any other regulatory authority does not assure or predict with any certainty that any other regulatory authority will approve the drug.
 In addition, existing regulatory policies and laws may change. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of new government regulation, either in the United States or in other countries, or the impact on our drug candidates or drugs. For example, new FDA regulation could delay or prevent marketing approvals, increase the cost of research and development, and result in narrower product labeling and expensive post-marketing requirements.
 Our activities and drugs will still be subject to extensive postmarketing regulation if approved.
 Following regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we and our collaborators will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements. There may also be additional postmarketing obligations imposed by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. These obligations may result in significant expense and limit the ability to commercialize such drugs.
 The FDA or other regulatory agencies may also require that the sponsor of the NDA or foreign equivalent, as applicable, conduct additional clinical trials to further assess approved drugs after approval under a post-approval commitment. Such additional studies may be costly and may impact the commercialization of the drug. Unfavorable trial results from postmarketing studies could negatively impact market acceptance of the drug; limit the revenues we generate from sales; result in the drug’s withdrawal from the market; negatively impact the potential approval of the drug in other territories; and result in litigation.
 The FDA or other regulatory agencies may also impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which a drug may be marketed. Additionally, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, study, including in connection with a drug’s approval, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug.
 With regard to any of drug that receives regulatory approval, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and the manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a drug, its manufacturer and the manufacturer’s facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of that drug, up to and including withdrawal of the drug from the market. In the United States, the DEA and comparable state-level agencies also heavily 
 27


regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, recordkeeping and distribution of drugs that are considered controlled substances, and the DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations.
 Our ability to generate revenues from any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.
 Any drug that may be approved for marketing may not gain market acceptance among patients, healthcare providers, healthcare payers or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such products will depend on a number of factors, including:
  
• | timing of market introduction of our drugs and competitive drugs and alternative treatments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | actual and perceived efficacy and safety of our drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | incidence and severity of any side effects;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | potential or perceived advantages or disadvantages as compared to alternative treatments;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | price of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the general marketplace for the particular drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the effect of current and future healthcare laws on our drug candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues to be profitable.
 Collaboration and license agreement relationships may lead to disputes and delays in drug development and commercialization, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of our drug candidates or drugs.
 We may have conflicts with our prospective, current or past collaborators or licensees, such as conflicts concerning rights and obligations under our agreements, the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data, the achievement of milestone or other payments, the ownership of intellectual property, or research and development, regulatory, commercialization or other strategy. Collaborators or licensees may stop supporting our drug candidates or drugs, including if they no longer view the program as in their best financial or other interests or they develop or obtain rights to competing drug candidates or drugs. In addition, collaborators or licensees may fail to effectively develop, obtain approval for or commercialize our drugs, which may result in us not realizing their full commercial potential. If any conflicts arise with any of our current, past or prospective collaborators or licensees, the other party may act in a manner that is adverse to our interests. Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay, or lead to termination of, development or commercialization of our drug candidates or drugs, and in turn prevent us from generating revenues:
  
• | unwillingness on the part of a collaborator or licensee to pay for studies or other research, milestones, royalties or other payments that we believe are due to us under a collaboration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaboration or license agreement activities, which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unwillingness on the part of a collaborator or licensee to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development, regulatory, commercialization, pharmacovigilance or other activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slowing or cessation of a collaborator’s or licensee’s research, development, regulatory or commercialization efforts with respect to our drug candidates or drugs; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | litigation or arbitration.
--+---------------------------

 Setbacks and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could make entering into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs more difficult and diminish our revenues.
 Setbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, such as those caused by safety concerns relating to drugs or drug candidates, as well as competition from generic drugs, litigation and industry consolidation, may have an adverse effect on us, 
 28


including by making it more difficult to enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs and diminishing our revenues. For example, the FDA may be more cautious in approving our drug candidates based on safety concerns relating to these or other drugs or drug candidates, or pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into new collaborations or continue existing collaborations if they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition or if their therapeutic areas of focus change following a merger.
 We and our collaborators rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies. If those parties do not comply with regulatory and contractual requirements, successfully carry out their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.
 In the course of our discovery, preclinical testing and clinical trials, we and our collaborators rely on third parties, including investigators, clinical research organizations, manufacturers and laboratories, to perform critical services. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. Clinical research organizations are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with regulatory requirements and our protocols, our preclinical studies or clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of collaborators, and we do not control their research and development, clinical trial or regulatory activities.
 We may participate in new strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses, present significant distractions to our management and be viewed as unfavorable.
 From time to time we consider strategic transactions, such as out-licensing or in-licensing of compounds or technologies, acquisitions of companies and asset purchases. Additional potential transactions we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, such as strategic collaborations, joint ventures, spin-offs, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. In addition, another entity may pursue us as an acquisition target. Any such transaction may be viewed as unfavorable by our stockholders or others and may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may create potential liabilities, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges, require additional expertise or disrupt our management or business, which could harm our operations and financial results.
 As part of an effort to enter into significant transactions, we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction. If we fail to realize the expected benefits from any transaction we may consummate, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks or other events, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 We may incur substantial liabilities for any product liability claims or otherwise as a drug product developer.
 We develop, test, manufacture and expect to commercialize drugs for use by humans. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in clinical trials, and a risk with the commercialization of lorcaserin as well as any other drug that may be approved for marketing.
 Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability or related litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. In addition, damages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition.
 29


An individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our drugs or drug candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:
  
• | decreased demand for our drug;
--+-------------------------------


• | injury to our reputation;
--+--------------------------


• | increased difficulty to attract, or withdrawal of, clinical trial subjects;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs of related litigation;
--+-----------------------------


• | substantial monetary awards to subjects or other claimants;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss of revenues; and
--+----------------------


• | the inability to commercialize our drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 We have limited product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and products. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, and we may not have insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 Arena GmbH manufactured BELVIQ and other products for commercialization or clinical trials, up until the sale of our manufacturing business to Siegfried effective March 31, 2018. Even after the sale, we could be subject to liability for manufacturing defect claims relating to our manufacturing activities that preceded the closing of the sale. For example, under our agreement with Eisai, we and Eisai will each bear 50% of losses arising from any alleged defective manufacturing of BELVIQ by Arena GmbH prior to the date of the sale to Siegfried.
 We have significant contractual obligations that may adversely affect our cash flow, cash position and stock price.
 We have long-term leases on real properties and other contractual obligations, and limited revenues. If we are unable to generate cash from operations in the future sufficient to meet our financial obligations, we will need to obtain additional funds from other sources, at all or on terms favorable to our stockholders or us.
 Also, if we do not have sufficient cash in the future and are unable to generate cash from operations or obtain additional funds from other sources sufficient to meet our contractual obligations, we may have to delay or curtail some or all of our development and commercialization programs, sell or license some or all of our assets on terms that you or others may view as unfavorable, or default under our agreements.
 We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare laws, including but not limited to fraud and abuse and false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties and prosecution.
 In the United States, drug manufacturers and marketers are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the research, manufacturing, sales, marketing and education programs for our drugs.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or the furnishing or arranging for, a good, item, facility or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Moreover, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. The ACA also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal Civil False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The Federal Civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the Federal Civil False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government, known as “qui tam” actions, and 
 30


such individuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend a Federal Civil False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim, in addition to other penalties that may apply. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the Federal Civil False Claims Act, some of which are broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer.
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the US Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Further, we may also be subject to state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.
 Additionally, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 We are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these fraud and abuse or other laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, possible exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 We may not be able to effectively integrate, manage or maintain our international operations, and such difficulty could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.
 We have certain clinical operations personnel in Switzerland, and we engage in clinical trials and manufacturing activities in many territories outside of the United States. There are significant risks associated with foreign operations, including, but not limited to, compliance with local laws and regulations, the protection of our intellectual property, the ability to integrate our corporate culture with local customs and cultures, the distraction to our management, foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of shifts in the United States and local economies on those rates, and integration of our policies and procedures, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, with our international operations.
 With respect to local laws and regulations, the European Union, Switzerland and certain other foreign territories have restrictions on the transfer, use and maintenance of certain personal data, including providing that transfers of personal data outside of their territories may only take place if the country to which the personal data is transferred ensures an “adequate” level of privacy protection. The European Commission has previously found that the United States did not provide adequate levels of protection. In 
 31


addition, the European Commission has approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. We conduct clinical trials in the EU, and in the future we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate, including restrictions on data transfers that may negatively impact our ability and increase our costs to maintain international operations.
 Additionally, California recently enacted legislation that has been dubbed the first “GDPR-like” law in the United States. Known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. When it goes into effect on January 1, 2020, the CCPA will require covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. Legislators have stated that amendments will be proposed to the CCPA before it goes into effect, but it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted. As currently written, the CCPA will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
 We and third parties we contract with use hazardous materials in our operations.
 Our activities involve the use of materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We cannot completely eliminate the risks associated with their use, storage or disposal, which could cause:
  
• | interruption of our development or manufacturing efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | injury to our employees and others;
--+------------------------------------


• | environmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | liabilities under domestic or foreign laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and type that we consider commercially reasonable, we cannot be certain that the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate, and we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research and development efforts caused by contamination.
 Our business and operations might be adversely affected by business disruptions and security breaches, including any cybersecurity incidents.
 Our US operations are primarily located in a business park in San Diego. We also have certain operations in Boston, Massachusetts, and Zug, Switzerland. We depend on our facilities and on collaborators, licensees, contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business, some of whom are located in Europe and Asia. Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including interruptions in the supply of natural resources, political and governmental changes, disruption in transportation networks or delivery services, severe weather conditions, wildfires and other fires, explosions, actions of animal rights activists, terrorist attacks, earthquakes and wars could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors and vendors.
 We depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems, which we use for, among other things, sensitive company data, including our financial data, intellectual property and other proprietary business information.
 While certain of our operations have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and other security measures intended to prevent and minimize the impact of IT-related interruptions, our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and vendors are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, electrical failures and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our research and development programs and other business operations. The loss of data from completed or future studies or clinical trials could result in delays in our research, development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Similarly, we and our licensees rely on third parties to conduct studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates, manufacture our drug candidates and lorcaserin, and warehouse, market and distribute lorcaserin, and similar events relating to these third parties’ computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or 
 32


inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the development of any of our other drug candidates and the commercialization of drugs could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.
 Even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, and our contractors may carry liability insurance that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors’ insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage. For example, we are not insured against a terrorist attack. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results. Moreover, any such event could delay our research and development programs and adversely affect, which may include stopping, our commercial production.
 We and our employees and directors may be named as defendants in litigation that could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention.
 Securities class action litigation may be brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because companies in the pharmaceuticals industry often experience significant stock price volatility. For example, beginning in 2010, a number of lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our employees and directors alleging we and the other defendants violated the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our BELVIQ trials, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. These lawsuits were settled in 2018.
 While we carry liability insurance, any losses we incur in connection with any future lawsuits may not be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover our losses or at all, and our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage. We may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with any future claims. A settlement of any of future lawsuit against us could also involve the issuance of common stock or other equity, which may dilute your ownership interest. Any payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition or your ownership interest. Even if the plaintiffs’ claims are not successful, any future lawsuit against us and/or our directors or executive officers could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, any such lawsuits may make it more difficult to finance our operations, obtain certain types of insurance (including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance), and attract and retain qualified executive officers, other employees and directors.
 Negative US and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from collaborators or the financial markets, and creates other financial risks for us.
 Negative conditions in the US or global economy, including financial markets, may adversely affect our business and the business of our current and prospective collaborators, distributors and licensees, which we sometimes refer to generally as our collaborators, and others with which we do or may conduct business. The duration and severity of these conditions is uncertain. If negative economic conditions persist or worsen, we may be unable to secure funding to sustain our operations or to find suitable collaborators to advance our internal programs, even if we achieve positive results from our research and development or business development efforts. Such negative conditions could also impact commercialization of any drugs we and our collaborators and licensees develop, as well as our financial condition.
 From time to time, we may maintain a portfolio of investments in marketable debt securities, which are recorded at fair value. Although we have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity, we rely on credit rating agencies to help evaluate the riskiness of investments, and such agencies may not accurately predict such risk. In addition, such agencies may reduce the credit quality of our individual holdings, which could adversely affect their value. Lower credit quality and other market events, such as changes in interest rates and further deterioration in the credit markets, may have an adverse effect on the fair value of our investment holdings and cash position.
 Currency fluctuations may negatively affect our financial condition.
 We primarily spend and generate cash in US dollars and present our consolidated financial statements in US dollars. However, a portion of our expected and potential payments and receipts under our agreements are in foreign currencies. A fluctuation of the exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the US dollar may, thus, adversely affect our financial results, including cash balances, expenses and revenues. We may in the future enter into hedging transactions to try to reduce our foreign currency exposure, but there is no assurance that such transactions will occur or be successful.
 33


Laws, rules and regulations, including relating to public companies, may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers.
 Laws and regulations affecting public companies, including rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, as well as other laws and regulations, including, for example, of foreign governments and relating to privacy, may result in increased costs to us, particularly as we continue to develop the required capabilities in the United States and abroad to develop and commercialize our products. These laws, rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws, rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot estimate accurately the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws, rules and regulations.
 Changes in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.
 The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 
 Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.
 Our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent potential errors and fraud
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all potential errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, or misstatements due to error, if any, within the company have been detected. While we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are and have been effective at the reasonable assurance level, we intend to continue to examine and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and to monitor ongoing developments in these areas.
 Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.
 As of December 31, 2018, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $1,274.2 million. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards ($869.4 million) will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2023, and our state net operating loss carryforwards ($404.8 million) begin expiring in 2028. Our net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In January 2019, a taxable income generating event, the transaction pursuant to the United Therapeutics Agreement, resulted in it being more-likely-than-not that a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards would be used to offset our estimates of taxable income in 2019. If the estimates we have made, or the assumptions on which we relied, in estimating our taxable income in 2019 prove inaccurate, our net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset our taxable income in 2019 may vary from our estimates. Under the newly enacted federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and we may experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and 
 34


our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. 
  Current and future tax laws and regulation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, which significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to this federal tax law.
 Changes or modifications in financial accounting standards, including those related to revenue recognition, may harm our results of operations.
 From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, either alone or jointly with other organizations, promulgates new accounting principles that could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or reported cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes prior revenue recognition guidance and establishes a comprehensive revenue recognition model with a broad principle that requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity identifies the contract with a customer, identifies the separate performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and recognizes revenue when each separate performance obligation is satisfied. The FASB subsequently issued additional ASUs to clarify certain elements of the new revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance (codified as Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606) allows for two methods of adoption: (a) “full retrospective” adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) “modified retrospective” adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance is recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance for the year of implementation. We adopted the new revenue standard effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative impact to our accumulated deficit balance at January 1, 2018, as a result of the adoption of ASC 606 was a decrease of $19.0 million. Any difficulties in implementing this standard, adopting or implementing any other new accounting standard, or updating or modifying our internal controls as needed on a timely basis, could result in our failure to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us. Finally, if we were to change our critical accounting estimates, including those related to the recognition of revenue, our operating results could be significantly affected.
 Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property
 Our success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain.
 Our success will depend on our own and on current or future collaborators’ abilities to obtain, maintain and defend patents. In particular, the patents directed to our drug candidates and drugs are important to developing and commercializing drugs and our revenue. We have numerous US and foreign patents issued and patent applications pending for our technologies. There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant technology or method, or that the patents will be held to be valid for their expected terms.
 35


The procedures for obtaining a patent are complex. These procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many sophisticated legal issues. Obtaining patent rights outside the United States often requires the translation of highly technical documents and an improper translation may jeopardize our patent protection. Ensuring adequate quality of translators and foreign patent attorneys is often very challenging. Consequently, the process for having our pending patent applications issue as patents will be difficult, complex and time consuming. Our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when, or if, we will obtain additional patents, or if the scope of the patents obtained will be sufficient to protect our drugs, or be considered sufficient by parties reviewing our patent positions pursuant to a potential marketing, licensing or financing transaction.
 In addition, other entities may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings. We cannot make assurances as to how much protection, if any, our patents will provide if we attempt to enforce them or they are challenged. It is possible that a competitor or a generic pharmaceutical provider may successfully challenge our patents and those challenges may result in reduction or elimination of our patent coverage.
 We also rely on confidentiality agreements and trade secrets to protect our technologies. However, such information is difficult to protect. We require our employees to contractually agree not to improperly use our confidential information or disclose it to others, but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform to their legal obligations under these agreements. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with prospective collaborators, collaborators, service providers and consultants, but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information. Many of our employees and consultants were, and many of them may currently be, parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements. In addition, third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or other proprietary information.
 Some of our research and development collaborators and scientific consultants have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights. We generally seek to prevent our collaborators and consultants from disclosing scientific discoveries before we have the opportunity to file patent applications on such discoveries. In some of our collaborations, we do not control our collaborators’ ability to disclose their own discoveries under the collaboration and in some of our academic relationships we are limited to relatively short periods to review a proposed publication and file a patent application. If we cannot maintain confidentiality in connection with our collaborations and relationships, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired.
 We believe that the United States is by far the largest single market for pharmaceuticals in the world. Because of the critical nature of patent rights to our industry, changes in US patent laws could have a profound effect on our future profits, if any. It is unknown which, if any, patent laws will change, how changes to the patent laws will ultimately be enforced by the courts and how it would impact our business. 
 A dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays or termination of our future research, development, manufacturing and sales activities.
 Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop and manufacture our drugs and drug candidates, market and sell drugs, and conduct our research and development activities without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. There are many issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others relating to research and development programs that could be determined to be similar, identical or superior to ours or our licensors or collaborators. We may be exposed to future litigation by others based on claims that our drugs, drug candidates, technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the areas of our research and development, including some which purport to allow the patent holder to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing. Numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in which we are developing drugs. There are also numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others that are directed to chemical compounds or synthetic processes that may be necessary or useful to use in our research, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities. These could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or manufacture, import or sell drugs, and our activities, or those of our licensors or collaborators, could be determined to infringe these patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our drugs, drug candidates or technologies may infringe. There also may be existing patents owned by others, of which we are not aware, that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe. Further, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications owned by others in fields relevant to our business, of which we are or may become aware, that we believe (i) are invalid, unenforceable, or we do not infringe; (ii) relate to immaterial portions of our overall research and development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts; or (iii) in the case of pending patent applications, the resulting patent would not be granted or, if granted, would not likely be enforced in a manner that would materially impact such efforts. We cannot assure you that others holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us and seek 
 36


damages or enjoinment of our activities. We also cannot assure you that, in the event of litigation, we will be able to successfully assert non-infringement, unenforceability, invalidity or immateriality, or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor. 
 In addition, others may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. We may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights, or we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights.
 There could be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry that affect us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Any legal action or administrative action against us, or our collaborators, claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities could:
  
• | require us, or our collaborators, to obtain a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prevent us from importing, making, using, selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consume a substantial portion of our managerial, scientific and financial resources; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be costly, regardless of the outcome.
--+--------------------------------------

 Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of pre-trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised. In addition, during the course of intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.
 We are aware of third-party patents, as well as third-party patent applications, that could adversely affect the potential commercialization of etrasimod. For example, we are aware of a third-party patent, as well as third-party patent applications, with broad claims to administering an S1P modulator by starting with a lower dose and then increasing to a higher, standard daily dose. While we do not believe that any such claims that would cover the potential commercialization of etrasimod are valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief. 
 We have been contacted from time to time by third parties regarding their intellectual property rights, sometimes asserting that we may need a license to use their technologies. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies, we may become involved in expensive and time-consuming litigation or we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our drugs or drug candidates.
 We and Eisai have filed patent infringement lawsuits against ANDA filers relating to “Paragraph IV certifications.” We cannot predict the outcome of any litigation matter. For example, our existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover a generic form of lorcaserin. If an ANDA filer were to prevail in patent litigation and/or receive approval to sell a generic version of lorcaserin, lorcaserin would become subject to increased competition and our revenue would be adversely affected.
 We cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
 Filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents on all of our drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to “work” the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our drug candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which makes it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.

Risks Relating to Our Securities
 Our stock price will likely be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value.
 Our stock price has fluctuated historically. From January 1, 2017, to February 22, 2019, the market price of our stock was as low as $11.30 per share and as high as $50.40 per share.
 Very few drug candidates being tested will ultimately receive regulatory approval, and companies in our industry sometimes experience significant volatility in their stock price. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly depending on a variety of factors, including:
  
• | results or decisions affecting the development or commercialization of any of our drug candidates or drugs, including the results of studies, trials and other analyses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the success, failure or setbacks of our or a perceived competitor’s drugs or drug candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing of the development of our drug candidates;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | discussions or recommendations affecting our drugs or drug candidates by the FDA or other reviewers of preclinical or clinical data or other information related to our drug candidates or drugs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory actions or decisions or legislation affecting drugs or drug candidates, including ours and those of our competitors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the commercial availability and success or failure of any of our drug candidates or lorcaserin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the development and implementation of our continuing development and research plans, including outcome studies for lorcaserin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the entrance into, or failure to enter into, a new collaboration or the modification or termination of an existing collaboration or other material transaction;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the timing and receipt by us of milestone and other payments or failing to achieve and receive the same;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fluctuation in prescriptions, sales or financial results (including with respect to revenue recognition, expenses and other operating results) or inaccurate sales or cash forecasting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accounting restatements and changes;
--+-------------------------------------


• | supply chain or manufacturing issues;
--+--------------------------------------


• | changes in our research and development budget or the research and development budgets of our existing or potential collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the introduction, development or withdrawal of drug candidates or drugs by others that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target or the introduction of new drug discovery techniques;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expenses related to, and the results of, litigation, other disputes and other proceedings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | financing strategy or decisions;
--+---------------------------------


• | the allocation of our resources;
--+---------------------------------


• | our ability, or the perception by investors of our ability, to continue to meet all applicable requirements for continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and the possible delisting of our common stock if we are unable to do so;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developments in intellectual property rights or related announcements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | capital market conditions.
--+---------------------------

 We are not able to control many of these factors. If our financial or scientific results in a particular period do not meet stockholders’ or analysts’ expectations, our stock price may decline, and such decline could be significant.
 Any future equity or debt issuances or other financing transactions may have dilutive or adverse effects on our existing stockholders.
 We have been opportunistic in our efforts to obtain cash, and we expect we will evaluate various funding alternatives from time to time. We may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities that could dilute your ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to yours. We have effective registration statements to sell shares of our common stock and certain other securities, and we may elect to sell shares pursuant to such registration from time to time. 
 38


Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or other financing transaction, and the investors may have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws or the transaction may otherwise adversely affect our business prospects and existing stockholders.
 Our executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price.
 Sales of our stock by our executive officers and directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our executive officers and directors may sell stock in the future, either as part, or outside, of trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC.
 There are a substantial number of shares of our common stock that may become eligible for future sale in the public market, and the sale of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.
 As of February 22, 2019, there were (i) options to purchase 8,560,316 shares of our common stock outstanding under our equity incentive plans at a weighted-average exercise price of $31.80 per share, (ii) 26,694 restricted stock unit awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans, (iii) 297,000 performance restricted stock units outstanding under our equity incentive plans, and (iv) 2,712,155 additional shares of common stock remaining issuable under our Amended and Restated 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
 Once issued, the shares described above will be available for immediate resale in the public market. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market. As of February 22, 2019, there were 49,462,849 shares of our common stock outstanding.
 The holders of our common stock and other securities may take actions that are contrary to your interests, including selling their stock.
 A small number of stockholders may hold or acquire a significant amount of our outstanding stock. From time to time, there is a large short interest in our stock. These holders of such stock or positions may seek control of us, support transactions that we or you do not believe are favorable, and they may have interests that are different from yours. In addition, sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price.
 We may also be involved in disagreements with the holders of our stock, warrants or other securities in the future. Such disagreements may lead to proxy contests or litigation, which may be expensive and consume management’s time, involve settlements, the terms of which may not be favorable to us, or result in other negative consequences to our business.
 Certain of our agreements, provisions in our charter documents, possible future agreements and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interests.
 There is a standstill provision in our transaction agreement with Eisai, and we may enter into agreements with similar provisions. In addition, we may in the future adopt a stockholders’ rights agreement, which would cause substantial dilution to any person who attempts to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors. These provisions or agreements, as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law, could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interests. For example, our charter provisions:
  
• | allow our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | eliminate stockholder action by written consent; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at stockholders’ meetings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
