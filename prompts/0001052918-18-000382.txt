Current Operations
 Overview
 The Company was incorporated for the purpose of engaging in mineral exploration and development activities. On August 28, 2017, the Company announced that it signed a definitive agreement (the Agreement) for the lease and option to purchase of the Bunker Hill Mine (the Mine) in Idaho. The Bunker Hill Lease with Option to Purchase is between the Company and Placer Mining Corporation (Placer Mining), the current owner of the Mine.

Highlights of the Agreement are as follows:
 *
 Effective date: November 1, 2017;
 *
 Initial lease term: 24 months;
 *
 The Company shall pay Placer Mining US$100,000 monthly mining lease payments, which shall be paid quarterly;
 *
 The lease can be extended for another 12 months at any time by the Company by paying Placer Mining a US$600,000 bonus payment and by continuing to pay the monthly US$100,000 lease payments;
 *
 The option to purchase is exercisable at the Companys discretion; and
 *
 Purchase by the Company can be made at any time during lease period and any extension thereto.
 On October 2, 2018, the Company announced that it was in default of its Lease with Option to Purchase Agreement with Placer Mining Corporation, the lessor of the Bunker Hill Mine. The default arose as a result of missed property payments, totaling $400,000, which were due at the end of September and on October 1, 2018. As per the Agreement, the Company has 15 days, from the date notice of default was provided (September 28, 2018), to remedy the default by making the outstanding payment. Bunker Hill is working with urgency to resolve this matter. Management does not believe that it will be able to remedy this default, resulting in the Bunker Hill Mine lease being terminated.
 Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company would have had the right to purchase the Mine at any time before the end of the lease and any extension thereto for purchase price payments totalling US $45 million as per the following table:

Under the terms of the Agreement, there is a 3% NSR on production during the Lease, and an NSR on production after the purchase option is exercised as follows:2% NSR until US$ 15M is paid, after which there is a 1% NSR until US$ 15M is paid, after which there is a 0.5% NSR until US$ 30M is paid, for a total maximum amount payable of US$ 60M.
 The Bunker Hill Mine was the largest producing mine in the Coeur d'Alene zinc, lead and silver mining district in northern Idaho.  Historically, the mine produced over 35M tonnes of ore grading on average 8.76% lead, 3.67% zinc, and 155 g/t silver (Bunker Hill Mines Annual Report 1980). 
 Products
 The Bunker Hill Mine is a Zinc-Lead-Silver development project. When back in production, the Company will mill mineralized material on-site and plans to produce concentrates to be shipped to third party smelters for processing.
Infrastructure
 The acquisition of the Bunker Hill mine includes all mining rights and claims, surface rights, fee parcels, mineral interests, easements, existing infrastructure at Milo Gulch, and the majority of machinery and buildings at the Kellogg Tunnel portal level, as well as all equipment and infrastructure anywhere underground at the Bunker Hill Mine Complex. The acquisition also includes all current and historic data relating to the Bunker Hill Mine Complex, such as drill logs, reports, maps, and similar information located at the mine site or any other location. 
Government Regulation and Approval
 The current exploration activities and any future mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, waste disposal, worker safety, mine construction, and protection of endangered and protected species. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations and permits or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could have an adverse impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. 
 Permits are in place to initiate mining operations. Any surface workings (e.g. mill and associated buildings) would be on Patented Ground or on privately-owned ground. As such, there are no anticipated permit impediments to the underground mine development. A water discharge permit, identified as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, must be obtained from the EPA within five years.
 The tailings facility and associated aspects may be permitted by the Idaho Department of Water Resources. 
 On March 7, 2018, the Company reported that the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Department of Justice signed an agreement with Bunker Hill, allowing the Company or any subsidiary entities to operate the Bunker Hill zinc, lead, and silver mine without incurring liabilities for hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants that migrated from the mine in the past. 
 The major obligations of Bunker Hill include:
 1.
 Payment to the EPA over a seven-year period totalling US$20M for as long as Bunker Hill leases, owns and/or operates the Mine (payments are on behalf of the current owner/lessor for the EPAs prior response costs as contemplated by the lease/option on the Mine and listed in the table above);
 2.
 Semi annual payments to the EPA to cover the cost of treatment of water outflowing from the Bunker Hill mine currently estimated to be approximately $480,000;
 3.
 Specified ongoing maintenance work on mine infrastructure to allow for proper management of mine effluent.
 The major obligations of the United States include:
 1.
 The United States covenants not to sue Bunker Hill for prior contamination migrating from the mine;
 2.
 The EPA agrees not to enforce any lien it may have on the mine so long as Bunker Hill is in compliance with its payment and maintenance work obligations;
 3.
 The EPA agrees to release any lien it may have on the mine upon the completion of Bunker Hills maintenance work and payment obligations.

Prior to beginning any drilling activities, the Company will receive any approvals/ required permits from the governing agency(s) with jurisdiction over the Bunker Hill property.
 Property Description
 The Companys agreement with Placer Mining Corporation includes mineral rights to 434 patented mining claims covering 5773.825 acres of those 35 include surface ownership over approximately 259.1 acres. The transaction also includes certain parcels of fee property which includes mineral and surface rights but are not patented mining claims. Mining claims and fee properties are located in Townships 47, 48 North, Range 2 East, Townships 47, 48 North, Range 3 East, Boise Meridian, Shoshone County, Idaho. 
 Surface rights were originally owned by various previous owners of the claims until the acquisition of the properties by BLP. BLP sold off surface rights to various parties over the years while maintaining access to conduct mining operations and exploration activities as well as easements to a cross over and access other of its properties containing mineral rights. Said rights were reserved to its assigns and successors in continuous perpetuity. Idaho Law also allows mineral right holders access to mine and explore for minerals on properties to which they hold minerals rights.
 Title to all patented mining claims included in the transaction was transferred from Bunker Hill Mining Co. (U.S.) Inc. by Warranty Deed in 1992. The sale of the property was properly approved of by the U.S. Trustee and U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
 Over 90% of surface ownership of patented mining claims not owned by Placer Mining Corp. is owned by different landowners. These include: Stimpson Lumber Co.; Riley Creek Lumber Co.; Powder LLC.; Golf LLC.; C & E Tree Farms; and Northern Lands LLC. 
 Patented mining claims in the State of Idaho do not require permits for underground mining activities to commence. The water discharge is being handled by the EPA at the existing water treatment plant, and the Federal water discharge permit comes along with the water treatment plant.
 Competition
 The Company competes with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of mining claims and leases on zinc and other base and precious metals prospects as well as in connection with the recruitment and retention of qualified employees. Many of these companies are much larger than the Company, have greater financial resources and have been in the mining business for much longer than it has. As such, these competitors may be in a better position through size, finances and experience to acquire suitable exploration and development properties. The Company may not be able to compete against these companies in acquiring new properties and/or qualified people to work on its current project, or any other properties that may be acquired in the future. 
 Given the size of the world market for base metals such as lead and zinc, relative to the number of individual producers and consumers, it is believed that no single company has sufficient market influence to significantly affect the price or supply of these metals in the world market. 
 Employees
 The Company is currently managed by John Ryan, President and CEO; Julio DiGirolamo, Chief Financial Officer; Dan Hrushewsky, Executive Vice President, and Howard Crosby, Executive Vice President.
 John Ryan and Howard Crosby serve on the Companys Board of Directors along with director Dickson Hall.
