ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History and Overview
 
History of Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation
 
BLOCKCHAIN HOLDINGS CAPITAL VENTURES, INC. (the “Company”), formerly Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (formerly Safe Lane Systems, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 10, 2013. Safe Lane Systems, Inc. redomiciled to become a Delaware holding corporation in September of 2016. On September 22, 2016, Safe Lane Systems, Inc. formed two wholly owned subsidiaries, SLS Industrial, Inc and Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (both Delaware corporations) and on September 30, 2016 completed a merger and reorganization in which Southeastern Holdings, Inc. (now Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc.) became the holding company. On December 1, 2016, the Company spun off its wholly owned subsidiary, SLS Industrial, Inc., along with its assets and liabilities, leaving Southeastern Holdings, Inc. as the only surviving entity.
 
On August 23, 2018, the Company entered into a Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Blockchain Holdings, LLC (“Blockchain”) pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the assets of Blockchain which are used in the business of sourcing of blockchain mining equipment from various suppliers for their customers and also providing management of the equipment hosted, mining pools and tech work on such equipment. The Company issued 300,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $.0001 valued at $300,000 to the members of Blockchain in exchange for the assets of Blockchain.
 
The Company has accounted for this transaction as a reverse recapitalization under ASC 805, under which the operating entity, Blockchain Holdings, LLC, adopted the assets, liabilities and equity structure of Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc. on August 23, 2018, while retaining its historical activity. The financial statements therefore present activity beginning with Blockchain Holdings, LLC’s inception date of February 5, 2018 through September 30, 2018.
 
On August 30, 2018 the Company changed its name to Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc.
 
Blockchain Holdings Capital Ventures, Inc is focused on finding, vetting and acquiring cash flowing assets including, Commercial Real Estate, Energy and Technology Companies.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. However, the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to do so. New business opportunities may never emerge, and we may not be able to sufficiently fund the pursuit of new business opportunities should they arise.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $6,293 in cash on hand. Our current monthly cash burn rate is approximately $35,000, and it is expected that burn rate will continue and is not expected to increase until significant additional capital is raised and our marketing plan is executed. Our trade creditors may call debts at any time, and our cash reserves would not be sufficient to satisfy all balances. We are currently dependent on minimal expenses to be covered by a loan or other cash infusion from the Company’s CEO and Director Mr. Wannemacher, and COO and Director, Daniel Wong. There is no guarantee that this cash infusion will continue to be made.

COMPANY BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
Our Company, originally Safe Lane Systems, Inc., was formed to develop the marketing of, and contract the manufacturing of, certain products resulting from the development of IP in design and manufacturing by Superior Traffic Controls, Inc. We licensed certain IP under a Master License and a Sub License to capitalize the marketing and contract manufacturing of certain products.
 
After spinning off the assets and liabilities of our traffic safety division in December 2016, we no longer possess the aforementioned intellectual property or rights thereto and have implemented a new business model.
 
Blockchain Holding Capital Ventures, Inc. (BHCV) is now focused on building a diversified set of assets with high growth potential and sustainable monthly returns. The Company’s foundation is built on commercial real estate assets in designated Opportunity Zones that have a specific energy footprint. The commercial properties are located in Opportunity Zones to take advantage of three unique elements: deferral of past capital gains tax, reduction in tax liabilities, and elimination of future capital gains tax. These benefits, coupled with revenue generated from leasing and improvements to the properties, offer strong growth potential and long-term returns. BHCVs unique hedging strategy protects against possible real estate downturns by increasing the value of the property and revenue generated with our custom-designed decentralized mobile data centers. BHCV offers low-cost, secure colocation and private data hosting. These services range from cloud or information services, communications, networking, blockchain mining, disaster recovery solutions, artificial intelligence, rendering, and other high demand needs for computing power.
 
Our Proposed Products:
 
Colocation Services
 
This will be our primary revenue stream. It is a major growth area with companies choosing to rent processing power for a growing number of needs, including blockchain mining, artificial intelligence, data storage, cloud computing, and data processing. BHCV will host space for servers, which will be leased on a space per-server monthly basis. BHCV will oversee real-time monitoring of these servers, with onsite IT and maintenance staff carrying out updates, preventative troubleshooting, and servicing to minimize any downtimes and ensure continuous processing power.
Mobile Data Center Solutions
 
BHCV has an exclusive agreement with a container solution company to customize and build data centers that are weather resistant, cost effective, quick to install, and have mobility in case the market conditions are not optimal. As part of the portfolio of data center solutions, BHCV expects to profit by approximately $50,000 per container sold. Each container will cost approximately $100,000 on average to develop and it will be shipped to BHCV’s customers directly.
Traditional Real Estate Leasing in Opportunity Zones
 
Lease of Commercial Space – Properties will be scouted based on a primary use in mind and forecasting the probability of finding a tenant. Tenants will be mainly companies in need of space for different needs, but initially focused on industrial and warehousing components. It is possible that the portfolio of real estate assets will include some retail or other consumer faced space, provided the opportunity is significant and the investment can be balanced off with a different property that would be specifically targeted to the colocation leasing space.
 
Commercial Real Estate Sales – Although this is one of our long term goals to be implemented in the future, we intend to build a strong portfolio of properties that will eventually allow us to be in a position to liquidate some of our future holdings.
 
Sales and Marketing Plan
 
Once the Company has raised the capital needed to roll out its products and services it will adopt an appropriate sales and marketing plan to support those efforts.
Sales Strategy
 
The core strategic vision of BHCV will be built around the development of a growing portfolio of commercial real estate assets, which will be carefully selected to offer the best potential for dual-use functionality. This dual-use focuses on utilizing the space to offer colocation of processing power by creating a network of leading-edge data centers, as well as more traditional leasing of any excess and dedicated commercial space. Amongst the colocation space, BHCV will be pressing the advantages of its decentralized datacenters, with inherent disaster recovery options and its modular mobile data centers which will offer durable, flexible, and affordable capacity for clients. However, in addition to this BHCV plans to hire and train a staff of sales representatives willing to search potential tenants in need of computing power for their applications. Ensuring competitive pricing, reliable power supply, processing uptime, flexible leasing agreements, and ongoing support and maintenance will help BHCV to develop its position within the data center market and help it to attract long-term value customers. BHCV will support this strategic vision and conceptual growth with the following:

● | Leveraging the complimentary expertise of its founders and leadership team, who possess unique synergies of experience and proven successes in the fields of blockchain technologies and real estate investment and management. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Robust site selection process with stringent criteria aimed at maximizing commercial use, whether for long-term commercial leasing or colocation purposes.

Primary Marketing Campaign Strategy
 
A strong marketing and promotional focus will be followed, with particular attention paid to networking and relationship building as well as supporting the extensive connections of the leadership and advisory team with engagement with real estate brokers. This will be further supplemented by high-profile attendances at conferences, expos, and trade shows relating to digital growth areas such as blockchain, cloud computing, and virtual and augmented reality. Outside of this, a full spectrum of marketing and promotional activities will be launched, using some of the following channels.

● | Internet Marketing – One of the most effective marketing channels for businesses is the internet, and the Company maintains an engaging web presence as a passive marketing placeholder, offering useful information about the history of BHCV and its services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Search Engine Optimization (SEO) – By utilizing SEO the Company can work on improving the visibility of the website on all major search engines such as Google, Bing, Ask, Yahoo, etc. 
● | Paid Online Advertisements – Pay per click (PPC) keyword advertising will help to promote contextual search results for the Company, and paying for advertisements with Google, AdSense, and other platforms to display ads on major search results and Facebook pages will help to promote contextual search results for the Company. 
● | Social Media Marketing (SMM) – Social Media Marketing is fast becoming the most popular channel by which businesses can engage with their target market and client base. The business, and its growing network of data centers, may establish social media channels on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, providing an outlet to stay in touch with clients and interact with the market. 
● | Traditional Marketing – Any comprehensive marketing campaign will include traditional marketing channels. This may include having print media advertisements in specialist interest magazines or periodicals, and BHCV will launch full press and PR campaigns, including press releases, articles or leaders in local newspapers or industry periodicals, announcements, white papers in industry press, investor or stock-market related publications, and notices and other engaging events. Direct marketing will also be utilized, including mailings of promotional literatures to key target markets, and supported by a growing team of sales representatives who will be approaching and engaging directly with prospective clients and showcasing the value proposition of BHCV full data center solutions.

● | Industry events and exhibitions – Having a presence at industry events and conventions can further increase brand awareness and industry reputation, and allow opportunities to interact with key decision makers at other businesses, organizations, consultancy partners, or technology companies. This can potentially result in new leads or other opportunities in future. Similarly, sponsoring or co-sponsoring such events or conferences can provide another effective backdrop to promote the Company.
