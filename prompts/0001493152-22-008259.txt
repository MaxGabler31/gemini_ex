Business
 
Abeona Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with our subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “Abeona” or the “Company”), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead clinical program is EB-101, an autologous, gene-corrected cell therapy for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (“RDEB”), which is currently in the pivotal Phase 3 VIITAL™ clinical trial. Following a comprehensive portfolio review in early 2022, we have decided to focus our research and development resources on the VIITAL™ readout while actively pursuing a potential commercialization partner for EB-101 with the objective of reducing operating expenses and extending our cash runway. As part of this portfolio prioritization, we have intensified our pursuit of a strategic partnership to take over development activities for our adeno-associated virus (“AAV”)-based gene therapy ABO-102 for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (“MPS IIIA”) and we have discontinued development of our AAV-based gene therapy ABO-101 for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (“MPS IIIB”). 
 
We plan to continue development of AAV-based gene therapies designed to treat ophthalmic and other diseases and next-generation AAV-based gene therapies using the novel AIM™ capsid platform that we have exclusively licensed from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (“UNC”), and internal AAV vector research programs.
 
We believe that our current product candidates are eligible for orphan drug designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or other expedited review processes in the U.S., Europe, Japan, or other world markets. Our pipeline includes programs for which we hold several U.S. and European Union (“EU”) regulatory designations, and a pipeline of additional earlier stage programs:
 

Our pipeline features early- and late-stage candidates with the potential to transform the treatment of devastating genetic diseases, and we are conducting clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad.
 
Our Mission and Strategy
 
Abeona is at the forefront of cell and gene therapy research and development. We are a fully-integrated company featuring therapies in clinical development, in-house manufacturing facilities, a robust pipeline, and scientific and clinical leadership. We see our mission as working to create, develop, manufacture, and deliver cell and gene therapies for people impacted by serious diseases. We partner with leading academic researchers, patient advocacy organizations, caregivers and other biotechnology companies to develop therapies that address the underlying cause of a broad spectrum of rare genetic diseases for which no effective treatment options exist today.

In 2021, we continued to make progress toward fulfilling our goal of harnessing the promise of genetic medicine to transform the lives of people impacted by serious diseases and redefining the standard of care through cell and gene therapies. Our strategy to achieve this goal consists of:
 
Advancing our Clinical Cell and Gene Therapy Programs and Research and Development with a Focus on Rare and Orphan Diseases. 
 
Through our cell and gene therapy expertise in research and development, we believe we are positioned to introduce efficacious and safe therapeutics to transform the standard of care in devastating diseases and establish our leadership position in the field.
 
Applying Novel Next-Generation AIM™ Capsid Technology to Develop New In-Vivo Gene Therapies.
 
We are researching and developing next-generation AAV-based gene therapy using our novel capsids developed from the AIM™ Capsid Technology Platform and additional Company-invented AAV capsids. We plan to continue to develop chimeric AAV capsids capable of improved tissue targeting for various indications and potentially evading immunity to wildtype AAV vectors.
Establishing Leadership Position in Commercial-Scale Cell and Gene Therapy Manufacturing.
 
We established current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”), clinical-scale manufacturing capabilities for gene-corrected cell therapy and AAV-based gene therapies in our state-of-the-art Cleveland, Ohio facility. We believe that our platform provides us with distinct advantages, including flexibility, scale, reliability, and the potential for reduced development risk, reduced cost, and faster times to market. We have focused on establishing internal Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) capabilities that drive value for our organization through process development, assay development and manufacturing. We have also deployed robust quality systems governing all aspects of product lifecycle from preclinical through commercial stage.
Establishing Additional Cell and Gene Therapy Franchises and Adjacencies through In-Licensing and Strategic Partnerships.
 
We seek to be the partner of choice in gene therapy treatment and have closely collaborated with leading academic institutions, key opinion leaders, patient foundations, and industry partners to generate novel intellectual property, accelerate research and development, and understand the needs of patients and their families.
 
Maintaining and Growing IP Portfolio. 
 
We strive to have a leading intellectual property portfolio. To that end, we seek patent rights for various aspects of our programs, including vector engineering and construct design, our production process, and all features of our clinical products including composition of matter and method of administration and delivery. We expect to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by aggressively seeking patent rights for promising aspects of our product engine and product candidates.
 
Our Pipeline
 
Our pipeline features early- and late-stage candidates with the potential to transform the treatment of devastating genetic diseases.
 
Our lead clinical program is EB-101, an autologous, gene-corrected cell therapy for RDEB, which is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Following a comprehensive portfolio review in early 2022, we have decided to focus our research and development resources on the EB-101 program with the objective of reducing operating expenses and extending our cash runway. As part of this portfolio prioritization, we have intensified our pursuit of a strategic partnership to take over development activities for our AAV-based gene therapy ABO-102 for MPS IIIA and we have discontinued development of our AAV-based gene therapy ABO-101 for MPS IIIB. We continue to develop additional AAV-based gene therapies designed to treat ophthalmic and other diseases and next-generation AAV-based gene therapies using the novel AIM™ capsid platform that we have exclusively licensed from UNC, and internal AAV vector research programs.

Developing Next Generation Cell and Gene Therapy
 
EB-101 for the Treatment of Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“RDEB”)
 
Disease Overview 
 
RDEB belongs to a group of genetic skin disorders known more broadly as epidermolysis bullosa. Patients with RDEB have a defect in the COL7A1 gene, resulting in the inability to produce Type VII collagen, which plays a vital role in anchoring the skin’s dermal and epidermal layers.
 
RDEB patients have fragile skin, which can easily damage to produce open and blistering wounds, disfiguring scars throughout the body, fused fingers and toes, limits in range of motion at joints (e.g., arms and legs), and an abnormal narrowing of the esophagus. Long-term RDEB patients can suffer from anemia, are at high risk of developing aggressive squamous cell carcinomas, infections, and premature death. The most severe patients are approximately 20 times more likely to die by 30 years of age than the general population.
 
Similar to other rare diseases, the incidence and prevalence of RDEB are not well defined. Incidence of 0.2 to 3.05 per million births and prevalence of 0.14 to 1.35 per million people have been observed across different geographies, primarily estimated by limited population analyses of clinical databases or registries (Eichstadt et al.; Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology, 2019). Using genetic modeling of COL7A1 variants, which is believed to cause RDEB, Stanford University estimated the incidence of RDEB to be approximately 63 per million births, and prevalence could be up to 3,850 patients in the U.S., whose wounds may benefit from COL7A1-mediated treatments such as EB-101.
 
RDEB patients have, on average, 11 active wounds on their bodies, with the majority > 20 cm2 (Stanford University; Solis, D., et al., 2017). In 2020, a survey of RDEB patients reported that approximately 60% have active wounds covering greater than 30% of their bodies (Bruckner et al.; Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, 2020). Wounds covering up to approximately 80% of body surface area have been recorded in some EB patients (Hirsch et al.; Nature Research, 2017).
 
We expect EB-101 could be a treatment option for large and chronic RDEB wounds for which EB-101 has shown durable healing and associated pain reduction in a phase 1/2 clinical trial. The data from the phase 1/2 clinical trial supports the VIITAL™ phase 3 trial. These larger and/or chronic wounds carry the highest burden, including the need for frequent dressing changes, pain, pruritus, risk of infection, and developing skin cancer.
 
Current Management of RDEB
 
At present, there are no approved treatments for RDEB in the U.S. or Europe.
 
Wound management currently consists of supportive care to limit contamination and infection, and reduction in mechanical forces that produce new blisters. Care usually includes treatment of new blisters by lancing and draining. Wounds are then dressed with a non-adherent material, covered with padding for stability and protection, and secured with an elastic wrap for integrity. The estimated annual cost of wound dressings alone for an RDEB patient can range from $245,000 per year to significantly higher in more severe cases.
 
RDEB patients also have periodic surgeries to relieve disease related issues such as narrowing of their esophagus, fusing of fingers, and corneal abrasions.

Program Status
 
EB-101 is an autologous, gene-corrected cell therapy in which a functioning COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient’s own skin cells (keratinocytes) using a retrovirus. The keratinocytes are then transplanted back to the patient to restore Type VII collagen expression and skin function.
 
EB-101 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), Breakthrough Therapy, Rare Pediatric Disease, and Orphan Drug designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”); as well as Orphan Drug designation by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”).
 
Results from a completed Phase 1/2 study that enrolled 7 patients with large and chronic RDEB wounds at Stanford University showed that EB-101 was well-tolerated and resulted in significant and durable wound healing (Siprashvili, Z., et al., 2016), with up to seven years of follow-up (Eichstadt, S., et al. JCI Insight 2019). To date, there have been no reported serious adverse events.
 
Over the past two years, we have been conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as VIITAL™, evaluating the potential of EB-101 for the treatment of RDEB. VIITAL™ is an ongoing randomized, control-matched Phase 3 clinical trial assessing treatment with EB-101 in 10 to 15 patients, comprising approximately 36 large chronic wound sites treated in total. The co-primary endpoints of VIITAL™ are a) proportion of EB-101 treated wounds with >50% healing from baseline at 24 weeks and b) improvement in pain at 24 weeks assessed by the Wong-Baker pain scale at time of dressing change versus an untreated control wound. The FDA has agreed on the endpoints and other characteristics of the study.
 
We achieved target enrollment for the VIITAL™ study in the first quarter of 2022. Given that the co-primary endpoints are measured at 24 weeks following treatment, we anticipate topline results in the third quarter of 2022. We are focusing our research and development resources on the VIITAL™ readout while actively pursuing a potential commercialization partner.


In 2021, we continued to prepare our cGMP commercial facility in Cleveland, Ohio for manufacturing EB-101 drug product to support our planned Biologics License Application (“BLA”) filing. EB-101 study drug product for all our VIITAL™ study participants has been manufactured at our Cleveland facility and we have now completed the update to Module 3 of the Investigational New Drug Application describing the in-house production of both retroviral vector and the final drug product. Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that we have alignment with the FDA on the CMC requirements for EB-101, including characterization and validation plans to support the BLA submission.
 
ABO-102 and ABO-101 for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III (Sanfilippo syndrome)
 
Disease Overview
 
MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four inherited lysosomal storage diseases, described as type A, B, C or D, which result from enzyme deficiencies responsible for abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (“GAGs”), which are long, linear polysaccharides also known as mucopolysaccharides, in body tissues that lead to progressive cell damage, and neurodevelopmental and physical decline. The incidence of MPS III (all four types combined) is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 births.
 
Lysosomes are intra-cellular sacs that harbor enzymes for replacing used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Children with MPS III are missing a lysosomal enzyme that is essential in breaking down mucopolysaccharides, specifically heparan sulfate. The partially broken down heparan sulfate remains stored in cells in the body causing progressive lysosomal and cell damage and eventually cell death. Babies may show little sign of the disease early in life, but as neurodevelopment is impaired and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear within the first few years of life.

-


In MPS III, the predominant symptoms are speech/language delay, cognitive decline, behavioral abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and seizures, eventually leading to premature death. Most patients with the rapidly progressing form of MPS III do not reach a level of cognitive function above that of an unaffected three-year-old child. Accumulation of heparan sulfate and related cell dysfunction also affects other organs, leading to liver enlargement and soft tissue coarsening. To date, there is no cure for MPS III and care is only supportive and palliative.
 
Program Status
 
In 2021, we continued developing AAV-based gene therapies ABO-102 and ABO-101 for MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome Type A and Sanfilippo syndrome Type B, respectively). These gene therapies are administered once through intravenous infusion. ABO-102 and ABO-101 deliver a functioning copy of the defective gene to cells of the central nervous system (“CNS”) and peripheral organs with the aim of halting the deleterious effects caused by the malfunctioning enzyme and impairment of lysosomal functioning. Both viral vector constructs rely on the neurotropism of the AAV9 serotype and its ability to cross the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) and deliver the functional copy of the gene to the CNS. 
ABO-102 for MPS IIIA
 
Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in animals with MPS IIIA showed that a single dose of ABO-102 significantly restored cell and organ function, corrected neurological deficits, increased motor control, and increased the lifespan by more than 100% one year after treatment compared with untreated control animals. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of MPS IIIA demonstrated that delivery of ABO-102 was well-tolerated with minimal side effects. ABO-102 received Fast Track and RMAT designations by the FDA, PRIME designation in the EU, Orphan Drug designations in the U.S. and EU, and FDA Rare Pediatric Disease designation.
 
MPS IIIA is caused by the absence of functional SGSH gene. In the pivotal gene transfer clinical trial of ABO-102 (scAAV9.U1a.hSGSH) for patients with MPS IIIA (study ABT-001; NCT02716246), subjects receive a single intravenous injection of ABO-102 to facilitate systemic delivery, including to the CNS, of a functional SGSH gene. Subjects are evaluated at multiple time points post-treatment for safety and signals of biopotency and clinical efficacy. The results to-date from the high dose cohort 3 showed evidence of preservation of neurocognitive development with continuous cognitive gains within normal range of a non-afflicted child, especially for children treated with ABO-102 with DQ higher than 60 around or before 30 months of age, as well as dose-related and sustained reduction in cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) levels of heparan sulfate, denoting transgene expression in the CNS, and a durable reduction of liver volume. No treatment related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported to date, with follow-up longer than two years post treatment in the majority of patients.
 
Summary of MPS IIIA ABO-102 Phase 1/2/3 Study Data as of March 2022:
 

● | 24 patients treated over three cohorts (including 18 patients in Cohort 3) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clear dose-response and sustained reduction of heparan sulfate levels in CSF 
● | Sustained reduction in liver volume 
● | Positive neurocognitive signals seen in younger, higher functioning patients enrolled in cohort 3 
● | As of March 2022, mean follow-up in cohort 1 (62 months); cohort 2 (57 months); and cohort 3 (23 months): 


○ | ABO-102 has been well tolerated to date 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | No deaths 
○ | No infusion-related adverse events 
○ | No serious drug-related adverse events 
○ | ELISpot negative for the SGSH enzyme 

 
In 2021, we continued recruitment in a second Phase 1/2 clinical trial with ABO-102 (study ABT-003; NCT04088734) to treat certain patients who did not qualify for participation in study ABT-001 for MPS IIIA. A total of 5 patients were treated. The ABT-003 study was terminated in March 2022 based on a lack of improved neurocognitive ability in older children with more advanced disease.

-


As part of our portfolio prioritization in early 2022, we have intensified our pursuit of a strategic partnership to take over development activities for ABO-102. As part of the FDA’s feedback on the Statistical Analysis Plan in January 2022, the FDA recommended that all participants be followed to an age of at least 60 months, which would shift timing of the neurocognitive outcomes data readout to late-2024/early-2025, as compared to our prior projection of the second quarter of 2023.


ABO-101 for MPSIIIB
 
Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in mice with MPS IIIB showed that a single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored cell and organ function, corrected neurological deficits, increased neuromuscular control, and normalized lifespan compared with untreated control animals. In addition, safety studies conducted in MPS IIIB mice and wildtype mice, and in non-human primates, demonstrated that systemic delivery of ABO-101 was well tolerated with minimal side effects.
 
In the ABO-101 (rAAV9.CMV.hNAGLU) program for patients with MPS IIIB, subjects in our ongoing Phase 1/2 gene transfer clinical study (study ABT-002; NCT03315182) receive a single, intravenous infusion of ABO-101, which uses an AAV9 vector to introduce a functional NAGLU gene to treat patients with MPS IIIB disease. Subjects are evaluated at multiple time points post-injection for safety assessments and efficacy parameters.
 
In 2021, we reported updated data from the ABT-002 trial showing dose dependent increases in plasma NAGLU activity, with normalization up to 6 months in cohort 3, accompanied by dose-dependent reductions of plasma and urinary heparan sulfate and urinary GAGs and decreased CSF levels of heparan sulfate levels sustained up to 24 months. Preliminary neurocognitive assessments, brain and liver MRI analyses demonstrate changes in the direction of improvement. Longer follow-up with patients treated in cohorts 2 and 3 is needed to confirm preliminary cognitive and brain volumetric changes. There was one serious drug-related adverse event of prolonged hospitalization reported in cohort 3 where the patient experienced a grade 2 episode of diarrhea and vomiting after treatment with ABO-101 and was required to stay in the hospital for two additional days for observation.
 
Summary of MPS IIIB ABO-101 Phase 1/2 Study Data as of March 2022:
 

● | 14 patients treated 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clear signals of biologic effect with reduction of disease-specific biomarkers in the CSF, plasma and urine and reduction in liver volumes 
● | Longer follow-up with patients treated in cohorts 2 and 3 is needed to address cognitive changes 
● | As of March 2022, mean follow-up in cohort 1 (32 months), cohort 2 (22 months) and cohort 3 (7 months): 


○ | ABO-101 has been well tolerated to date 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | No deaths 
○ | No infusion-related adverse events 
○ | One serious drug-related adverse event requiring two additional days of hospitalization for observation due to a grade 2 episode of diarrhea and vomiting 
○ | ELISpot negative for the NAGLU enzyme 

 
In 2021, we discontinued enrollment in our ABO-101 study and in March 2022, we decided to discontinue all further ABO-101 development activities.
 
Next-Generation Gene Therapy Treatments anchored in AIM™ Vector Platform
 
In 2016, we licensed a library of first-generation novel AAV capsids from UNC. In partnership with academic institutions, our own scientific research teams have identified vectors within the AIM™ capsid library showing strong potential to successfully target and reach the central nervous system as well as ocular, lung, muscle, liver, and other tissues. Based on continuing research being conducted by Abeona and our research partners, we observed improvements in gene delivery to specific tissues compared to currently available AAV technology. We believe AIM™ vectors also have the potential for redosing subjects who previously received certain AAV gene therapy or subjects who have pre-existing antibodies to naturally occurring AAV serotypes.

ABO-50X for the treatment of genetic eye disorders
 
Program Overview
 
This research program comprises several vectors being tested for different monogenic retinal disorders. Eighty percent of genetic eye disorders affect the photoreceptor or RPE cells, and correction of mutations in the retina has been accomplished by several groups using AAV gene therapy delivered through subretinal or intravitreal injection. We are exploring various routes of administration to deliver AAV to the retina, including subretinal, intravitreal and para-retinal delivery. We believe intravitreal delivery of small volume gene therapies is an attractive alternative to deliver gene therapy to the retina in an out-patient setting. We anticipate para-retinal injection to be safer as compared to subretinal and may serve programs that currently require subretinal dosing.
Program Status
 
ABO-50X AAV-based vectors are currently undergoing lead candidate identification. Preclinical animal studies are ongoing in indication-specific disease mouse models with readouts expected in the later part of 2022.
 
Early preclinical findings from mouse models identified the novel AIM™ capsid AAV204 as one of three lead candidate capsids that demonstrate robust transduction of retinal cells. The data in mice demonstrated that intravitreal administration of AAV204 resulted in broad retinal expression that penetrated to the photoreceptor and retinal pigmented epithelium layers.
 
Mouse findings were confirmed in non-human primates where we noted that intravitreal administration of AAV204, expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), resulted in broad transgene expression in the peripheral retina as well as intense expression in the fovea 25 days post-administration. Para-retinal administration of AAV204, expressing GFP, also showed transduction of photoreceptor cells in the fovea as well as strong expression in retinal ganglion cells throughout the retina.
 
ABO-201 for the treatment of CLN3 disease, also known as juvenile Batten disease (or Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis) (“CLN3 Disease”)
 
Disease Overview and Program Overview
 
CLN3 disease is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of CLN3 disease is vision impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This regression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid-to-late-childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Normal life expectancy is greatly reduced with most people with juvenile Batten disease only living into their twenties or thirties. As of December 31, 2021, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of CLN3 disease.
 
ABO-201 (scAAV9.CLN3) is an AAV-based gene therapy that has shown preclinical efficacy following delivery of a functioning copy of the CLN3 gene in a mouse model of CLN3 disease. Preclinical studies have previously demonstrated reduced lysosomal storage and decreased astrocyte/microglia activation in the CNS as well as improved motor function.

ABO-401 for the Treatment of Cystic Fibrosis
 
Disease Overview and Program Overview
 
Cystic Fibrosis (“CF”) is a progressive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene. Malfunction of this gene affects cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive fluids. In unaffected individuals, these secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery, but in cystic fibrosis, a defective CFTR gene causes the secretions to become thick and sticky. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts, and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas, and cause repeated lung infections and difficulty breathing, impaired pancreatic function and digestive abnormalities.
 
The preclinical ABO-401 program employs the AAV204 AIMTM capsid. ABO-401 has shown the ability to deliver the CFTR transgene to the lungs of gut-corrected delta-F508 mice. Another study also demonstrated correction of the underlying chloride current deficit in human CF donor-derived nasal and bronchial epithelium cells treated with ABO-401. Correction of chloride channel current following ABO-401 administration occurred regardless of underlying mutations of the CFTR gene, including the most common CF mutation, delta-F508.
 
Establishing Leadership Position in Commercial-Scale Cell and Gene-Therapy Manufacturing
 
We have established a cGMP manufacturing facility, the Elisa Linton Center located in Cleveland, Ohio, which enables us to enhance supply chain control, establish tighter quality control testing, increase supply capacity, reduce production costs and gain manufacturing efficiency for clinical trials related to our product candidates and ensure commercial demand is met in the event our therapies receive marketing approval. Our facility is led by a team of highly-skilled production, process/assay development and QC scientists with expertise in cell and gene therapy, particularly in cell culture, upstream manufacturing, downstream purification, assay development and wet lab techniques.
 
We have completed the first two phases of our 26,000+ square foot manufacturing build-out plans in Cleveland, Ohio. The first phase, completed in 2018, was a 6,000 square foot state-of-the-art cGMP production facility for the manufacturing of cell and gene therapies. The facility is designed to initially manufacture clinical drug products with later intent of manufacturing commercial grade cGMP drug product. The second phase, completed in 2019, was the completion of an additional 8,000 square feet of state-of-the-art laboratory space to support our expanding quality control, process development, and assay development teams. The second phase also included nearly 2,000 square feet of cGMP Inventory Control space. In connection with our shift in strategic priorities in 2022, we have ceased the planned build-out of additional AAV manufacturing space intended for ABO-102.
 
We have advanced our in-house manufacturing capabilities for our autologous cell replacement therapy (EB-101) for the treatment of RDEB. The product is manufactured as a multilayer cellular sheet containing corrected keratinocytes that is fastened to a petrolatum gauze backing with surgical hemoclips. Gene-corrected sheets are applied over wound areas, where they are expected to produce keratinocytes with functioning Type VII collagen, providing wound coverage and allowing for long-term wound healing. A key component to the EB-101 drug product manufacturing process is the retroviral vector which delivers the functional copy of the Collagen VII Alpha 1 cDNA to the autologous patient cells. Initially developed at the Indiana University Vector Production Facility, we have transferred the cGMP manufacturing process for the LZRSE-Col7A1 retroviral vector to our Cleveland, Ohio facility and have produced three cGMP lots for analytical and clinical comparability. We have also created and characterized a cGMP master cell bank and a working cell bank to support the cGMP production of the retroviral vector.
 
We have established AAV vector manufacturing capabilities that use the triple plasmid transient transfection method. We insert, or transfect, many copies of three DNA plasmids encoding the specific therapeutic gene sequence, or transgene, the capsid coding sequence, and helper sequences into AAV-293 cells using a serum-free, suspension-based bioreactor vector production technology. During an incubation period following transfection, each cell produces AAV vectors through biosynthesis using the cells’ natural machinery. At the end of the incubation period, the newly generated AAV vectors are harvested, purified and filtered in a multi-step process. We continue to maintain focus on cGMP compliance and ensuring adequate supply to support our future clinical activity.

We have established and maintained strong and collaborative relationships with third-party companies specializing in the testing of cell and gene therapy material to complement our process and assay development needs.
 
We have made significant investments in developing optimized manufacturing processes and believe that our processes and methods developed to date provide a comprehensive manufacturing process for EB-101 and AAV-based vector therapies, including:
 

● | sufficient scale to support commercial manufacturing requirements for EB-101 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | processes related to biopsy, cell collection, storage and transportation as part of manufacturing for EB-101 
● | processes related to product release testing for EB-101 
● | processes related to the manufacture and release testing of retroviral supernatant 
● | establishing transportation and packaging processes and materials for finished EB-101 product 
● | proprietary AAV vector manufacturing processes and techniques that produce a highly purified product candidate 
● | AAV serum-free suspension technology that is readily scalable 
● | multiple assays to accurately characterize our process and the AAV vectors we produce 
● | a series of purification processes, which may be adapted and customized for multiple different AAV capsids, with a goal of higher concentrations of active vectors, and that are essentially free of empty capsids. 

 
We believe that these improvements will enable us to develop best-in-class, next-generation cell and gene therapy products. As we look to potentially commercialize EB-101, if approved, we are working towards filing a potential BLA to support commercial manufacturing of EB-101 from our Cleveland facility. Based on feedback from the FDA, we believe that we have alignment with the FDA on the CMC requirements for EB-101, including characterization and validation plans.
 
Maintain a Strong Intellectual Property Portfolio
 
We strive to protect our commercially important proprietary technology, inventions, and know-how, including by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, both for inventions developed internally and for inventions licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platforms, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our position in the field of cell and gene therapy. We may also rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 
Our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and intellectual property rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. In some cases, these rights may need to be enforced by third-party licensors. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we may not be granted patents with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 
We are actively seeking U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including the following: research tools and methods, methods for transferring genetic material into cells, AAV-based biological products, methods of designing novel AAV constructs, methods for treating diseases of interest and methods for manufacturing, packaging, and transporting our product candidates. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel biological products. We seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. We are a party to various license agreements that give us rights to use specific technologies in our research and development, and future commercialization.

We will explore in due course strategies to support patent term extensions for all of our licensed portfolios.
 
U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products including gene therapy products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and regulations implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, advertising, and promotion of biologic products. Applications to the FDA are required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. Gene therapy studies may also need to comply with the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”), which includes additional requirements, such as the review and approval of the study by an Institutional Biosafety Committee. 
 
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (“OTAT”) and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee (“CTGTAC”), a panel of medical and scientific experts and consumer representatives, to advise CBER on its reviews. The FDA has issued a growing body of guidance documents on chemistry, manufacturing, and control (“CMC”), clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products.
 
The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an application for an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA objects within 30 days; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
● | development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency; 
● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 


13
--


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
● | payment of user fees and the FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. BLA application fees for products designated as orphan drugs by the FDA are waived. 

 
Before testing any biologic product candidate on humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 
If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, the study must also comply with the NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA. However, many companies and other institutions, not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines, voluntarily follow them. 
 
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 
Human clinical trials under an IND
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, which generally are physicians not employed by, or under the control of, the trial sponsor. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
 
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves communications to study subjects before a study commences at that site and the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
 
Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to NIH for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.

--


Investigational biologics and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1: The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2: The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
● | Phase 3: The biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for product approval. Under some limited circumstances, however, the FDA may approve a BLA based upon a single Phase 3 clinical study plus confirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence. 

 
Additional kinds of data may also help to support a BLA, such as patient experience data. Real world evidence may also support a BLA, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental BLAs, data summaries may provide marketing application support. For genetically targeted products and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application.
 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted or may be required by FDA after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.
 
Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, IRBs, IBCs, and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure, or other safety information. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 
The FDA, the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA or an IRB may also impose conditions on the conduct of a clinical trial.

Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials
 
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product efficacy in support of an IND or BLA application; and long term patient and clinical study subject follow up and reporting requirements. The FDA has also issued draft guidance specific to the development of gene therapy products for neurodegenerative diseases as such products may face special challenges related to CMCs and clinical and preclinical development, due to the nature of the products and potential patient population (e.g., children), the heterogeneity of neurodegenerative disorders, the route of administration, the volume of the product that can be administered, the delivery device, and the study population size.
 
Compliance with cGMP requirements
 
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations for both clinical and commercial supply. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products at the commercial stage also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and list the manufactured products. Recently, the information that must be submitted to FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
U.S. review and approval processes
 
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 
For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is a necessary condition to effective treatment. For the therapies we are currently developing, we believe that diagnoses based on symptoms, in conjunction with existing genetic tests developed and administered by laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, are sufficient to select appropriate patients and will be permitted by the FDA. For future therapies, however, it may be necessary to use FDA-cleared or FDA-approved diagnostic tests to select patients or to assure the safe and effective use of therapies in appropriate patients. The FDA refers to such tests as in vitro companion diagnostic devices and the combination of the in vitro companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic would be considered to be a combination product.
 

16
--


The use of the two products together must be shown to be safe and effective for the proposed intended use and the labeling of the two products must reflect their combined use. In some cases, the device component may require a separate premarket submission; for example, when the device component is intended for use with multiple drug products. Sponsors of clinical studies using investigational devices are required to comply with FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. Once approved or cleared, the sponsor of the device component submission (or the combination product submission, if both components are covered by one premarket submission) would need to comply with FDA’s post-market device requirements, including establishment registration, device listing, device labeling, unique device identifier, quality system regulation, medical device reporting, and reporting of corrections and removals requirements.
 
The FDA has a policy position that, when safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on a diagnostic device, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic device at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The type of premarket submission required for a companion diagnostic device will depend on the FDA classification of the device. A premarket approval, or PMA, application is required for high risk devices classified as Class III; a 510(k) premarket notification is required for moderate risk devices classified as Class II; and a de novo request may be used for novel devices not previously classified by the FDA that are low or moderate risk. 
 
The FDA may, however, approve a therapeutic product without the concurrent approval or clearance of a diagnostic device when the therapeutic product is intended to treat serious and life-threatening conditions for which no alternative exists and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of the drug/biologic outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved/cleared companion diagnostic. The FDA would also consider whether additional protections, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, or post-approval requirements, are necessary. At this point, it is unclear how the FDA will apply this policy to our gene therapy candidates. Should the FDA deem genetic tests used for selecting appropriate patients for our therapies to be in vitro companion diagnostics requiring FDA clearance or approval, we may face significant delays or obstacles in obtaining approval for a BLA. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biologic product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee that must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to accept for filing any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.
 

17
--


The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
 
On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter (“CRL”) generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. If those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, patient populations, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA also may not approve label statements that are necessary for successful commercialization and marketing. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may also be extended if new information is submitted to the application.
 
Orphan drug designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biologic product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If granted, prior to product approval, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and certain user-fee waivers. The tax advantages, however, were limited in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Orphan product designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 

18
--


If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the party holding the exclusivity fails to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan product sameness decisions are an evolving space. FDA has issued a final guidance document on how the agency will determine the “sameness” of gene therapy products. Pursuant to the guidance, “sameness” will depend on the product’s transgene expression, viral vectors groups and variants, and other product features that may have a therapeutic effect. Generally, minor differences between gene therapy products will not result in a finding that two products are different. Any FDA sameness determinations could impact our ability to receive approval for our product candidates and to obtain or retain orphan drug exclusivity. Competitors additionally may receive approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan medicinal product status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 
Expedited development and review programs
 
The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
 

● | Breakthrough therapy designation: To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives the following: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative, and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Priority review: A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review. 


19
--


● | Accelerated approval: Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy (which may include a cell or gene therapy) that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 
Post-approval requirements
 
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 
 
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official lot release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biologic products.
 
There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, excluding orphan products. In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutics are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other requirements, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon the company and third-party manufacturers.

A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s marketing, advertising, and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to a product that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Biopharmaceutical companies, however, are required to promote their products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts. 
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription biopharmaceutical samples is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of samples at the federal level. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription biopharmaceutical product. Certain reporting related to samples is also required. Free trial or starter prescriptions provided through pharmacies are also subject to regulations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and potential liability under anti-kickback and false claims laws.
 
Moreover, the enacted Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, imposed obligations on sponsors of biopharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, sponsors are required to provide certain information regarding the products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label products with a product identifier, and are required to keep certain records regarding the product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by sponsors is also required to be done electronically. Sponsors must also verify that purchasers of the sponsors’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation manufacturers have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Similar requirements additionally are and will be imposed through this legislation on other companies within the biopharmaceutical product supply chain, such as distributors and dispensers, as well as certain sponsor licensees and affiliates.
 
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing or FDA notification may be required. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, adverse publicity, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications to healthcare professionals or patients, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years to account for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 
Pediatric exclusivity
 
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States that, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection that cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve a biosimilar application.
 
Biosimilars and exclusivity
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“PPACA”), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biologic product, referred to as biosimilars. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and it may not be approved until 12 years thereafter. These exclusivity provisions only apply to biosimilars—companies that rely on their own data and file a full BLA may be approved earlier than 12 years. Moreover, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve-year exclusivity period. The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.

In an effort to increase competition in the biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and the FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. For example, in 2020 the FDA finalized a guidance to facilitate product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved biologic products, including those subject to REMS, provide samples of the approved products to persons developing biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees and costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs for reference and generic drug products.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease Voucher Program
 
Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Voucher Program, the FDA can award priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease products where the product is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases that primarily affect individuals up to age 18. To qualify, the product must contain no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved by the FDA. The application must also meet other qualifying criteria, including eligibility for FDA priority review. If the necessary qualifying criteria are met, upon a sponsor’s request and product approval, the FDA may award a priority review voucher. This voucher may be transferred and may be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Use of a priority review voucher is subject to an FDA user fee. As these vouchers are transferable, sponsors may sell these vouchers for substantial sums of money. Vouchers may, however, be revoked by the FDA under certain circumstances and sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease products must submit certain reports to the FDA. To take advantage of the benefits of this program, the product must be designated by the FDA for a rare pediatric disease no later than September 30, 2024, and approved no later than September 30, 2026, unless the law is reauthorized by Congress. 
 
Government regulation outside of the United States
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, sponsors are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of biologic products. Because biologically-sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 
Whether or not a sponsor obtains FDA approval for a product, a sponsor must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Save where the Clinical Trial Regulation applies (see below) in relation to cross-border trials, in the European Union, for example, a request for a Clinical Trial Authorization (“CTA”) must be submitted to the competent regulatory authorities and the competent Ethics Committees in the European Union Member States in which the clinical trial takes place, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with the European Union and the European Union Member State’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, fines, suspension, variation or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.

European Union regulation and exclusivity
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biologic product under European Union regulatory systems, applicants must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of their products to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
 
Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the European Union based on a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. Innovative medicinal products for which marketing authorization is granted are entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products cannot make an MMA relying on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product to support their application and such generics or biosimilars cannot be placed on the market until 10 years after the first EU marketing of the reference product. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company, nevertheless, could also market another competing medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 
Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive 10 years of market exclusivity. During this 10-year period, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and European Commission may not accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication. There are, however, three exceptions to this principle. Marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same orphan indication if:
 

● | The second applicant can establish in its application that its medicinal product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
● | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply sufficient quantities of orphan medicinal product. 

 
An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for the conduct of pediatric trials. The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation; for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable and no longer justifies the maintenance of market exclusivity or if the manufacturer cannot produce sufficient quantities to supply the orphan population.

The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar, in principle, to those in the United States. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan medicinal product designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Clinical Trials Regulation”), which replaced the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Clinical Trials Directive”) on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trial Regulation has overhauled the previous system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU whereby all clinical trial approvals were granted purely on a national basis. Specifically, the legislation, which is directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU, whereby there is a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. However, the Clinical Trial Regulation does increase public disclosure requirements in relation to clinical trial information.
 
In the European Union there are also broadly equivalent regimes for the other issues addressed in relation to US regulation including cGMP requirements, accelerated access (generally through so-called Conditional Marketing Authorizations), pediatric requirements and incentives and patent term restoration (supplementary protection certificates).
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons, and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from falling under the Anti-Kickback Statute, these are narrow, and practices may not fall under the applicable safe harbors and exemptions. For example, the United States Department of Health and Human Services recently promulgated a regulation that is effective in two phases. First, the regulation excludes from the definition of “remuneration” limited categories of (a) PBM rebates or other reductions in price to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or a Medicaid Managed Care Organization plan reflected in point-of sale reductions in price and (b) PBM service fees. Second, effective January 1, 2023, the regulation expressly provides that rebates to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D either directly to the plan sponsor under Medicare Part D, or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager will not be protected under the anti-kickback discount safe harbor. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation;

● | the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act (the “FCA”), which prohibit, among other things, individuals, or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. FCA claims may be pursued by whistleblowers through qui tam actions, even if the government declines to intervene and civil liability may be predicated on reckless disregard for the truth. The PPACA also codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Separately, the criminal federal False Claims Act imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent;

● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as, but not limited to, physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family. Payments made to physicians and certain research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. Reported information is made publicly available in searchable formats by CMS; 
● | additional federal false statements and fraud and abuse statutes prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery or payment for health care benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. PPACA amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation; and 
● | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and European Union and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, may be stricter than those applicable in the US and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, debarment from government contracting or refusal of orders under existing contracts, corporate integrity agreements or consent decrees, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and imprisonment. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly.

Data Privacy and Security
 

● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH Act, and similar state laws impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. HIPAA’s security and certain privacy standards are directly applicable to persons or organizations of covered entities, other than members of the covered entity’s workforce, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. The HITECH Act strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and individuals, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, may regulate the privacy and security of information that we maintain, many of which may differ from each other in significant ways and may not be preempted by HIPAA; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the General European Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became applicable May 25, 2018, harmonizes data privacy laws across Europe. The GDPR sets forth rules relating to the protection with regard to the processing and transfer of personal data as well as an individual’s right to the protection of personal data, including medical information and clinical trial related data. In addition, there are rules relating to the export of personal data outside the European Union and in particular there are certain challenges in relation to export to the United States. 

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, required disclosures of pricing and sensitive cost data, requirement for payment of manufacturer rebates and negotiation of supplemental rebates, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies as part of health technology assessment that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. EU member states may approve a specific price for a product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

Health Reform
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts. For example, healthcare reform measures under the Affordable Care Act included increased Medicaid rebates, expanded the 340B drug discount program, and changes requiring manufacturer discounts currently set at 70 percent on Part D utilization in the Part D coverage gap or “donut hole” and multiple provisions that could affect the profitability of our drug products. There is continuing development of value-based pricing and reimbursement models. Moreover, on November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. Current and future healthcare reform measures may significantly affect our sale of any products, and we continue to face major uncertainty due to the status of major legislative initiatives surrounding healthcare reform.
Additional Regulation
 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic and chemical substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
Competition
 
Companies that are currently engaged in gene therapy or companies not yet focused on developing cell and gene therapies could at any time decide to develop therapies relevant to our business. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and may have significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates and commercializing those product candidates. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for product candidates and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ product candidates may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also may compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 

28
--


We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new product candidates enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
