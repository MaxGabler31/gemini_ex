Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for urologic conditions. Our lead product candidate, vibegron, is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that was observed to be highly selective for the human beta-3 adrenergic receptor in in vitro assays. Vibegron is currently being developed for three potential indications: overactive bladder, or OAB, the treatment of OAB in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, and the treatment of abdominal pain due to irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS.  Our second product candidate, URO-902, is a novel gene therapy that we are developing for patients with OAB who have failed oral pharmacological therapy.
 In March 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial evaluating vibegron for the treatment of OAB. In this pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial with over 1,500 patients, vibegron 75 mg met both co-primary efficacy endpoints and all seven key secondary endpoints. Onset of action for the co-primary endpoints was observed as early as week two, the first time point measured, and statistically significant efficacy was maintained at all timepoints measured through the end of the study. We plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, by the first quarter of 2020. OAB is a highly prevalent condition, with more than 30 million Americans over the age of 40 suffering from bothersome symptoms. In large, randomized, placebo-controlled, international Phase 2b and Japanese Phase 3 clinical trials in a total of over 2,600 OAB patients, vibegron 50 mg and 100 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo at week 8 and week 12, respectively. Our Phase 3 clinical trial had a design in line with these clinical trials. We believe vibegron, if approved by the FDA, may offer a differentiated profile compared to current OAB therapies, including the potential for broader efficacy claims if the FDA approves the inclusion of urgency data, rapid onset of action data, and a single convenient once-daily dose in the label. Vibegron has been well tolerated in all clinical trials to date, has not been associated with clinically relevant drug-drug interactions, such as the inhibition of CYP2D6, and has not demonstrated a QTc signal at any of the human doses tested.

In March 2019, we initiated the Phase 3 COURAGE randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial for OAB in men with BPH who are also taking BPH medications but continue experiencing OAB symptoms in approximately 1,000 patients. The study is being conducted in two phases, with the first phase focusing on safety and the second phase assessing efficacy and safety, and is testing vibegron 75 mg versus placebo, the same dose studied in our Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial. The primary efficacy analysis for the co-primary efficacy endpoints will be measured at 12 weeks and include change from baseline in the average number of micturitions per 24 hours and change from baseline in the average number of urgency episodes per 24 hours. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in the average number of nocturia episodes per night, which is awakening at night to use the bathroom to urinate. The duration for the double-blind study is 24 weeks. In addition, a 28-week open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of vibegron in men with OAB symptoms and on another therapy for BPH. 
 In December 2018, we enrolled our first patient in a 200 patient Phase 2a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with vibegron 75 mg for abdominal pain due to IBS. We expect to receive top-line data from the Phase 2a clinical trial in 2020. The primary endpoint will be a 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity, while secondary endpoints will include Global Improvement Scale ratings, stool symptoms and safety. 
 We received an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize vibegron worldwide, excluding Japan and certain other Asian territories, pursuant to our license agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, which we entered into in February 2017. We expect to maintain patent exclusivity for the licensed patents and applications, if approved, under this license agreement covering composition of matter and methods of use and manufacture of vibegron until approximately 2034, including through grant of patent term extension. Vibegron is also being developed by Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Kyorin, for the treatment of OAB in Japan and certain other Asian territories. Kyorin received marketing approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for vibegron for the treatment of adults with OAB in September 2018. 
 Our second product candidate, URO-902, is a novel gene therapy that we are developing for patients with OAB who have failed oral pharmacological therapy. There are no currently available FDA-approved gene therapy treatments for OAB. We plan to initiate a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of URO-902 in approximately 50 to 80 patients.
 We received an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize URO-902 worldwide, pursuant to our license agreement with Ion Channel Innovations, LLC, or ICI, which we entered into in August 2018. Pursuant to this agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of a pending international patent application relating to URO-902 gene therapy, covering the use of URO-902 gene therapy to treat signs or symptoms of OAB or detrusor overactivity. This patent application, if issued, would naturally expire in 2038, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. In addition, we expect that URO-902 would receive 12 years of marketing exclusivity if approved by the FDA given its status as a biological product.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leading urology company by developing, commercializing and acquiring innovative therapies. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 

• | Complete the development and obtain FDA approval of vibegron for the treatment of OAB. In March 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial evaluating vibegron for the treatment of OAB. In this pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, vibegron 75 mg met both co-primary efficacy endpoints and all seven key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA by the first quarter of 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and complete the clinical development of vibegron for additional indications. In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 2a clinical trial of vibegron for abdominal pain due to IBS. We also initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of vibegron for OAB in men with BPH in March 2019. Both of these potential indications present significant additional commercial opportunities to treat millions of patients in the United States. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs specifically for either of these indications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the commercial potential of vibegron. We intend to build an initial sales force of approximately 150 persons in the United States, targeting high-prescribing urologists and other specialists that treat high numbers of patients with urologic conditions. We believe these physicians have a significant number of OAB patients in their practice and often serve as the diagnosing and treating physicians for OAB. We intend to scale the commercial presence to reach additional health care professionals as vibegron sales grow. We believe that our commercial leadership team, with experience launching over 20 prescription products, positions us well to efficiently pursue the significant market opportunity for vibegron in the United States. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for vibegron inside and outside the United States. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance the clinical development of URO-902 as a novel treatment for OAB patients who have not responded to oral pharmacological therapies. We intend to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of URO-902 for the treatment of OAB patients who have not responded to other pharmacological therapies. With only two non-surgical therapies currently available for the treatment of OAB, BOTOX and neuromodulation, we believe there is an opportunity to both capture market share and expand the OAB third-line therapy market. Approximately 14 million Americans seek treatment from their physician for OAB and, of these patients, only an estimated 3.3 million patients take prescription therapy and only 300,000 patients utilize current third-line procedural therapies. We estimate that approximately 72% of treated OAB patients discontinue oral therapy within one year. We estimate that third-line treatments generate aggregate annual sales in excess of $700 million in the U.S. market. We believe a third-line treatment option that is non-surgical and not a toxin, unlike BOTOX, would be appealing to physicians and patients, potentially meeting the unmet needs of this patient population.

• | Acquire or in-license additional clinical- or commercial-stage product candidates for the treatment of urologic conditions in a capital-efficient manner. Through focused business development efforts, we intend to identify and acquire or in-license additional innovative therapies for urologic conditions. Our initial focus is on conditions that are predominantly treated by urologists. Our parent company, Roivant Sciences Ltd., or RSL, and its subsidiaries have extensive experience in acquiring or in-licensing products in a range of therapeutic areas and will continue to support us in identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and in-licensing opportunities.

Vibegron for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder
 Overactive Bladder Overview 
 OAB is a clinical condition characterized by the sudden urge to urinate that is difficult to control, referred to as urgency, with or without accidental urinary leakage, and usually with increased frequency of urination. Accidental urinary leakage resulting from urgency is referred to as urge urinary incontinence, or UUI. Increases in age and body mass index, as well as diabetes and post-menopausal status, are known to increase the risk of developing OAB. Symptoms of OAB can have a debilitating impact on psychosocial functioning and quality of life, profoundly impacting normal social and occupational activities and leading to depression, anxiety and decreased sexual function and marital satisfaction. UUI, in particular, may have severe psychological and social consequences, resulting in restricted activities and unwillingness to be exposed to environments where access to a bathroom may be difficult. In 2018, over 18 million prescriptions were written for OAB medications in the United States. Current prescription pharmacological therapies for OAB consist of anticholinergic drugs and a beta-3 agonist. The OAB patient experience is depicted below.
 

OAB presents a significant burden on healthcare systems. A recent study found that healthcare costs among OAB patients in the United States were 1.4- to 2-times higher than individuals without OAB, and these costs may be substantially driven by managing complications such as falls, urinary tract infections, skin rash and depression or anxiety.

Current Treatment Paradigm 
 More than 30 million Americans over the age of 40 suffer from bothersome symptoms of OAB. Approximately 46% of this population, or 14 million people, talk to their physicians about their symptoms. Behavioral therapies such as bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training and fluid management are recommended as first-line treatment for OAB. Second-line treatment consists of prescription pharmacological therapy with an anticholinergic or a beta-3 agonist. In 2018, over 18 million prescriptions for oral OAB medications were written for an estimated 3.3 million patients in the United States. We estimate that approximately 72% of treated OAB patients discontinue oral therapy within one year. Third-line treatment includes procedural therapy using either intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX) or neuromodulation. This treatment paradigm is depicted below.
 

We estimate that each percentage point of the current U.S. OAB market is worth approximately $70 million per year in gross sales based on mirabegron’s wholesale acquisition cost of $384.29 per month (Price Rx, January 2019) and the over 18 million oral OAB prescriptions in the United States in 2018. In 2018, according to IQVIA NSP, the three branded oral OAB medications, Myrbetriq, Vesicare and Toviaz achieved $2.6 billion gross sales in the United States.
 Anticholinergic drugs have been the standard of pharmacologic care for OAB since the approval of flavoxate in 1970 and oxybutynin in 1975. Anticholinergics, however, are associated with poor tolerability and increasing safety concerns. According to an IQVIA custom longitudinal study of OAB diagnosed patients from March 2014 through September 2017, 86% of OAB patients treated with oral prescription therapy in the United States are initially prescribed anticholinergic drugs. Of these, 71% discontinue treatment within six months. Anticholinergic side effects include dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision. Further, there is a growing body of evidence associating anticholinergic use with cognitive impairment and dementia. Anticholinergics have also been associated with the increased use of healthcare resources. 
 In a 2015 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, a journal of the American Medical Association, a prospective analysis of over 3,400 patients aged 65 and older showed a 10-year cumulative anticholinergic dose-response relationship with increased risk of both dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, this study showed that a subject with a cumulative exposure to over 1,095 total standardized daily doses of an anticholinergic medication (calculated as cumulative medication dose divided by the minimum effective daily dose recommended for older patients) would have an adjusted hazard ratio for the risk of incident dementia of 1.54 (95% confidence interval of 1.21 to 1.96). Adjusted hazard ratio represents relative risk of incident dementia compared to a subject with no anticholinergic drug usage, adjusting for differences in 16 other characteristics that could confound the relationship between anticholinergic medicine use and dementia. Therefore, we estimate that exposure to over 1.5 years of 10 mg daily oxybutynin, the most commonly prescribed anticholinergic for OAB in the United States, would correspond to a 54% increase in the risk of dementia. The minimum effective daily dose for oxybutynin is 5 mg, but the most commonly prescribed daily dose is 10 mg. The observed relationship between cumulative anticholinergic use and incident dementia is shown in the following graph:

Association of Incident Dementia with 10-Year 
 Cumulative Anticholinergic Use1
 

Due to the potential medication-related cognitive risks, the study emphasized that it is important to minimize anticholinergic use over time. Over 30 retrospective analyses, with a total of over 40,000 patients, have helped further establish a relationship between anticholinergic use and cognitive impairment. This risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly population is especially important given the well characterized age-dependent increased prevalence of OAB symptoms. 
 In a survey of 432 physicians that we commissioned, 35% of physicians acknowledged that anticholinergic use can cause significant cognitive impact on patients and 30% of physicians acknowledged that anticholinergic use can significantly increase the risk for dementia. In contrast, approximately 30% of physicians indicated they did not believe anticholinergic use had a cognitive impact on patients and 28% of physicians indicated they did not believe anticholinergic use increased the risk for dementia. Based on these results, we believe there is low awareness among physicians around the significant cognitive risks associated with anticholinergic use. 
 When physicians and OAB patients are made aware of these increased risks of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease associated with anticholinergic use, aversion towards using these drugs increases. For example, the 2015 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reported that over a mean follow-up period of 7.3 years, 797 participants, or 23%, developed dementia. In a third-party market research study we commissioned, which surveyed 120 OAB patients and 150 physicians, including urologists, primary care physicians and OB/GYNs, when presented with this figure, 44% of surveyed physicians and 75% of OAB patients had a negative response towards using anticholinergics. 
 BOTOX, as a third-line treatment for OAB, is expensive and invasive. Administration involves 20 injections via cystoscopy into the detrusor muscle, approximately every 24 weeks. Unwanted side effects associated with the use of BOTOX for OAB include urinary tract infections and urinary retention. In addition, some patients need to self-catheterize post-treatment for several weeks due to urinary retention. Sacral neuromodulation and peripheral tibial nerve stimulation, which are highly invasive and used by a small fraction of the OAB patient population, are also available as third-line therapies.

Beta-3 Agonists 
 Beta-3 agonists constitute the newest class of oral prescription therapy for OAB. The beta-3 adrenergic receptor is the most prevalent beta-adrenergic receptor subtype on the smooth muscle around the bladder. Bladder filling involves the relaxation of this muscle and the contraction of the urethral smooth muscle, while voiding involves contracting the bladder muscle and relaxation of the urethral muscle. Studies of isolated human bladder smooth muscle have shown that selective activation of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor results in smooth muscle relaxation. Therefore, beta-3 stimulation can increase bladder capacity and reduce the symptoms of OAB. 
 In 2012, mirabegron (Myrbetriq), a beta-3 agonist, became the first drug other than an anticholinergic approved by the FDA for the treatment of OAB. Mirabegron remains the sole beta-3 agonist on the market for OAB, and since its approval, it has continued to take U.S. OAB prescription share from anticholinergics, primarily due to its safety and tolerability advantages. In 2018, according to IQVIA NPA, mirabegron’s market share grew by 17%, from 15% in 2017 to 17.5% in 2018. Astellas reported net sales of mirabegron in the Americas of $773 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, representing growth of approximately 18% over the prior fiscal year. The graph below shows the number of oral OAB prescriptions in the United States for the last two calendar years.
 U.S. Oral OAB Market: 2017-2018 Annual Prescriptions
 

Despite its success, mirabegron requires dose titration that results in a slow onset of action and is associated with frequent drug-drug interactions and QTc prolongation. Mirabegron’s onset of action is eight weeks at the starting dose of 25 mg and within four weeks at a dose of 50 mg. Efficacy of both the starting dose and 50 mg doses of mirabegron was maintained through the 12-week treatment period. Further, mirabegron’s U.S. label has a note in the warnings and precautions section about drug-drug interaction risk related to its known inhibition of the CYP2D6 enzyme, an important enzyme involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs. According to an IQVIA Longitudinal Study Among Diagnosed OAB patients (March 2014 to September 2017), approximately 37% of patients taking mirabegron are taking other drugs that are metabolized via the CYP2D6 pathway, presenting increased risk of exacerbated adverse events in patients taking mirabegron with these drugs. In addition, in a thorough QTc study, mirabegron demonstrated QTc prolongation in women at a supratherapeutic dose, or a dose greater than the maximum approved dose (50 mg), as noted in the pharmacodynamic section of its U.S. label.

Our Solution: Vibegron 
 Vibegron is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that was observed to be highly selective for the human beta-3 adrenergic receptor in in vitro assays. We are developing vibegron for the treatment of OAB.
 We believe vibegron, if approved by the FDA, has the potential to address the limitations of both anticholinergics and mirabegron and become a differentiated beta-3 agonist based on the following potential advantages: 

• | Met both co-primary endpoints (statistically significant reduction in daily micturitions and daily UUI episodes) and all seven key secondary endpoints in our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial. In this pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, vibegron 75 mg met both co-primary efficacy endpoints and all seven key secondary endpoints, including a clinically meaningful reduction in daily urgency episodes. In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily vibegron met the co-primary endpoints at week 12, achieving statistical significance over placebo on both reduction in daily UUI episodes (p<0.0001) and reduction in daily micturitions (p<0.001). The difference from placebo was statistically significant as early as week 2, which was the first timepoint measured, for both episodes and micturitions (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively), and statistically significant efficacy was maintained at all timepoints measured through the end of the study for both endpoints. Additionally, at all measured timepoints, vibegron achieved numerically better efficacy than tolterodine, the active control in this study, which is a currently available OAB treatment. All seven pre-specified key secondary endpoints were met, including a statistically significant reduction in daily urgency episodes compared to placebo (p=0.002).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Met primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and was well tolerated in large, randomized, placebo-controlled international Phase 2b and Japanese Phase 3 clinical trials. Vibegron has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials with a total of over 2,600 OAB patients. In large, randomized, placebo-controlled, international Phase 2b and Japanese Phase 3 clinical trials, vibegron 50 mg and 100 mg met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints compared to placebo at week 8 and week 12, respectively. These endpoints included reductions per day in number of micturitions, urgency episodes, UUI episodes and total incontinence episodes. In addition, vibegron was well tolerated in these trials. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Observed to be highly selective for the human beta-3 adrenergic receptor in in vitro assays. In vitro studies conducted comparing the selectivity of vibegron with mirabegron have demonstrated that vibegron is highly selective relative to beta-1 and beta-2 agonism. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid onset of action. In clinical trials, vibegron has demonstrated an onset of action in as early as two weeks. In our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial vibegron achieved rapid onset by two weeks in both co-primary endpoints and reduction in daily urgency episodes, making vibegron the only beta-3 agonist to demonstrate an onset of action by two weeks. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for broader efficacy claims, including urgency data, based on successfully meeting the co-primary and all seven key secondary efficacy endpoints in our pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial. Currently, no approved OAB therapies in the United States can promote efficacy data for the reduction of urgency episodes related to OAB symptoms. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that the FDA will consider inclusion of urgency data as the most important secondary endpoint, as well as additional data to support potentially broader efficacy claims, in the vibegron label, if approved by the FDA. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No known dementia risk. There is a growing body of evidence that “anticholinergic load” may lead to an increased risk of dementia. Existing data also suggest that use of anticholinergic agents may have an impact on cognition, especially in the elderly. This increased risk of dementia combined with the poor side effect profile of the anticholinergic class, such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision, has led to significant U.S. oral OAB prescription share gains of the beta-3 agonist class. There is no evidence to date linking the use of beta-3 agonists with increased risk of dementia. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No CYP2D6 drug-drug interactions. CYP2D6 is one of the most important and common enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs with approximately 20% of all drugs being metabolized by CYP2D6. In addition, approximately 43% of patients taking any oral OAB medication, including 37% of mirabegron patients, are taking other drugs that are metabolized via the CYP2D6 pathway. Vibegron is not an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and therefore has a reduced risk for potentially harmful drug-drug interactions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | No QTc signal. In a thorough QTc study designed to assess the potential for increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, vibegron showed no QTc prolongation at therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. If approved, vibegron would be the only beta-3 agonist without demonstrated QTc prolongation in the product label. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single, convenient dose. Our pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial studied a single, fixed dose of vibegron. If approved, vibegron will be the only beta-3 agonist available that does not require dose titration. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Crushable dose formulation. We intend to demonstrate that vibegron can be crushed and delivered to patients in food. If successful, vibegron would be the only beta-3 agonist that can be crushed and delivered in food, an important option for elderly and other select patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Based on a third-party market research study we commissioned, which surveyed 120 OAB patients and 150 physicians, including urologists, primary care physicians and OB/GYNs, we believe each of the above factors could represent a meaningful advantage over mirabegron. Specifically, both patients and prescribers identified the potential for no CYP2D6 drug-drug interactions and no QTc signal, as well as the potential for rapid onset of action and single-crushable dose formulation, as highly motivating differentiators. Furthermore, based on vibegron’s potential product profile, approximately 50% of surveyed physicians indicated that they would be attracted to, or willing to use, vibegron if approved with such a profile. Among OAB patients currently taking an anticholinergic, approximately 62% indicated that they would be attracted to, or willing to ask their physician to replace their current treatment with, vibegron based on its potential product profile. We believe there is a significant opportunity for a new OAB treatment as approximately 86% of OAB patients treated with oral prescription therapy in the United States are initially prescribed anticholinergic drugs. 
 Phase 3 EMPOWUR Trial for Overactive Bladder 
 In March 2018, we enrolled the first patients in our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial of vibegron in adults with OAB. The EMPOWUR trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled clinical trial in men and women with OAB wet or dry. The trial had a design in line with those of the Phase 2b and Japanese Phase 3 clinical trials. Enrollment of more than 1,500 patients into the EMPOWUR trial was completed in October 2018. 
 Enrolled patients were randomized across more than 200 sites into one of three groups for a 12-week treatment period: vibegron 75 mg administered orally once daily, placebo administered orally once daily, or extended release tolterodine, or tolterodine ER (a commonly prescribed anticholinergic for OAB), 4 mg administered orally once daily. Additionally, more than 500 patients completing the initial 12-week blinded assessment have been enrolled in a 40-week double-blind extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of longer-term treatment. 
 In March 2019, we reported positive top-line results from our international pivotal Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial of vibegron in adults with OAB. Vibegron met co-primary endpoints demonstrating highly significant reduction in daily urge urinary incontinence episodes and micturitions. Vibegron also met all seven key secondary endpoints, including a clinically meaningful reduction in daily urgency episodes. 
 To be eligible for the EMPOWUR trial, patients had to be at least 18 years old with a history of OAB (as diagnosed by a physician) for at least three months. During the screening period, patients were required to experience on average at least eight micturitions per day; either an average of at least three urgency episodes per day or at least one UUI episode per day; and total UUI episodes exceeding stress urinary incontinence episodes. 
 The co-primary efficacy endpoints at week 12 of our Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial were: 
  
• | change from baseline in the average number of micturitions per 24 hours in all patients; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | change from baseline in the average number of UUI episodes per 24 hours in patients with OAB wet.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Secondary endpoints included, among others, changes in the frequency of urgency episodes and total incontinence episodes (which includes all incontinence episodes, whether UUI or stress-related), as well as self-reported quality of life scores. In addition, adverse events are being monitored during both the trial and the extension study. As of June 13, 2019, two patients, ages 63 and 75 and with multiple comorbidities, have died in our EMPOWUR clinical program enrolling over 1,500 patients. In both cases, the investigators deemed the deaths not treatment-related. Separately, our independent assessment also deemed each death not treatment-related. The death in the 75 year old patient occurred in the tolterodine ER treatment group. The death of the 63 year old patient occurred in the EMPOWUR extension study, which is still blinded and we do not know which of the two treatment arms (vibegron or tolterodine ER) this patient was in. 
 10

In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily vibegron met the co-primary endpoints at week 12, achieving statistical significance over placebo on both reduction in daily UUI episodes (p<0.0001) and reduction in daily micturitions (p<0.001). The difference from placebo was statistically significant as early as week 2, which was the first timepoint measured, for both UUI episodes and micturitions (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively), and statistically significant efficacy was maintained at all timepoints measured through the end of the study for both endpoints. Additionally, at all measured timepoints, vibegron achieved numerically better efficacy than tolterodine, the active control in this study, which is a currently available OAB treatment. 
 All seven pre-specified key secondary endpoints were met, including a statistically significant reduction in daily urgency episodes compared to placebo (p=0.002). 
 p-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning there is a less than 1-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The FDA utilizes statistical significance, as measured by p-value, as an evidentiary standard of efficacy and typically requires a p-value of 0.05 or less to demonstrate statistical significance. The results of the co-primary and key secondary endpoints used in our Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial at the end of the study are depicted below. 
 

The EMPOWUR Phase 3 clinical trial data showing reductions in daily UUI episodes over time are shown in the graphs below.

Vibegron was well tolerated and the most common adverse events reported versus placebo (>2% in vibegron and greater than placebo) were headache (4.0% vs 2.4%), nasopharyngitis (2.8% vs 1.7%), diarrhea (2.2% vs 1.1%), and nausea (2.2% vs 1.1%). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms (1.1% in placebo, 1.5% in vibegron, and 2.3% in tolterodine). The incidence of the reported adverse event of hypertension was equal to placebo (1.7% in vibegron, 1.7% in placebo, and 2.6% in tolterodine). 
 In the Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial there were two serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported in two patients in the vibegron treatment group considered to be treatment related by the investigator: (1) non-cardiac chest pain in one patient (with no evidence of an acute cardiac event) and (2) pneumonia in one patient. Our independent assessment did not consider these SAEs to be treatment related. 
 We plan to submit an NDA to the FDA by the first quarter of 2020. The IND for vibegron for the indication of OAB was transferred to us by Merck in February 2017.
 Current and Projected Reimbursement Landscape for Beta-3 Agonists in the United States 
 Access to oral OAB therapy is managed primarily by differential co-payments, or co-pays. Payors generally charge the lowest co-pays for generic drugs and higher co-pays for branded agents such as Vesicare or Myrbetriq. As of May 2019, 90% of commercial plans and 100% of Medicare plans covered Myrbetriq, the only currently marketed beta-3 agonist. According to IMS PayerTrak, in 2018, the U.S. payor mix for the oral OAB prescription market was approximately 52% Medicare Part D, 37% commercial or cash and 11% other payors. In addition, the long-term care channel accounted for approximately 18% of all oral OAB prescriptions in the United States. Based on a third-party database analysis of 4,477 commercial plans and 1,476 Medicare Part D plans, Myrbetriq has approximately 60% preferred access and 98% unrestricted access of Medicare Part D covered lives and approximately 62% preferred access and 70% unrestricted access of commercial lives. 
 In May 2018, we commissioned a third-party market research study to assess how vibegron would be covered, if approved. The research firm interviewed representatives of payors, who are involved with, but not solely responsible for, access and reimbursement decisions. Such interviewees represented payors covering over 80 million U.S. commercial and Medicare Part D lives.
 Based on this study and our analysis of the current coverage of OAB therapies, we believe the OAB pharmacologic category is not highly managed by payors. The payor representatives interviewed expect that vibegron would be managed at a preferred or non-preferred branded tier, without prior authorization, allowing physicians and patients to make the choice of whether to pay a higher co-pay for a branded product or a lower co-pay for a generic. In addition, these payor representatives anticipate that vibegron’s coverage would not change following Myrbetriq’s loss of marketing exclusivity, which we expect to occur in 2023 or 2024. Based on this study, we also believe that access to vibegron, if approved, will not be restricted to patients who first fail any other oral therapies for OAB. As with all pharmacologic branded products, access decisions will require formulary review through the formulary review process.

In June 2018, we commissioned a second market research study, conducted by a separate third-party market research firm, to further assess how vibegron would be covered, if approved. The research firm interviewed representatives of payors who are involved with, but not solely responsible for, access and reimbursement decisions. Such interviewees represented payors covering over 160 million U.S. commercial and Medicare Part D lives. 
 The results of this additional study reinforced the results of the May 2018 study with regard to vibegron’s potential coverage. In addition, the payors interviewed indicated that they believe the OAB pharmacologic category is not highly managed and is instead primarily controlled through differential co-pays for branded OAB drugs as compared to generic OAB drugs. They expect the OAB pharmacologic category will continue to be managed this way.
 Vibegron for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder in Men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia 
 BPH is characterized by prostate enlargement, which can block the urethra and prevent normal urine flow, and is progressive with age. There are approximately 40 million men between the ages of 50 and 80 in the United States with BPH, approximately 4.5 million of whom are treated for their BPH symptoms. In addition, approximately 50% of BPH patients also suffer from OAB. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for OAB in men with BPH.
 According to IQVIA NDTI, as of March 2018, BPH patients, similar to OAB patients, are generally treated by urologists and primary care physicians. Further, due to historical concerns with acute urinary retention, a potential side effect of anticholinergics, there has been hesitancy among doctors to prescribe anticholinergics for the treatment of OAB in men with BPH. As a result, a majority of men with BPH and OAB are not treated for their OAB symptoms, and this remains an area of high unmet medical need.
 We believe that developing vibegron specifically for the treatment of OAB in men with BPH would be highly complementary to our overall OAB program. 
 In March 2019, we initiated an approximately 1,000 patient Phase 3 COURAGE randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial for OAB in men with BPH who are also taking BPH medications but continue experiencing OAB symptoms. The study is being conducted in two phases, with the first phase focusing on safety and the second phase assessing efficacy and safety, and is testing 75 mg of vibegron versus placebo, the same dose studied in our Phase 3 EMPOWUR trial. The primary efficacy analysis for the co-primary efficacy endpoints will be measured at 12 weeks and include change from baseline in the average number of micturitions per 24 hours and change from baseline in the average number of urgency episodes per 24 hours. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in the average number of nocturia episodes per night, which is awakening at night to use the bathroom to urinate. The duration for the double-blind study is 24 weeks. In addition, a 28-week open-label extension study will evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of vibegron in men with OAB symptoms and on another therapy for BPH. 
 Vibegron for the Treatment of Abdominal Pain due to Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
IBS is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with two or more of the following: defecation, a change in frequency of stool and a change in form or appearance of stool. Additionally, IBS presents a significant health care burden and can severely impair a patient’s quality of life. There is a large and growing market for IBS with constipation (IBS-C) and IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) branded prescription sales, as shown in the graph below.

IBS Branded Sales (2018)
 

The currently approved therapies for IBS-C include Linzess, marketed by Allergan and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Amitiza, marketed by Mallinckrodt plc and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; and Trulance, marketed by Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and the currently approved therapies for IBS-D include Xifaxan, marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., and Viberzi, marketed by Allergan. These drugs do not adequately address the pain associated with IBS, and there are no currently marketed drugs indicated specifically for IBS-associated pain. There are approximately 30 million to 40 million Americans with IBS symptoms, 30% of whom consult with their physician. Approximately 80% of these patients identify pain as a symptom contributing to the severity of their IBS. Based on this data, we estimate that there is an addressable market in the United States of approximately 7.2 to 9.6 million patients who suffer from IBS-associated pain. 
 The beta-3 adrenergic receptor is expressed in the neurons and the smooth muscle of the human colon. In vitro studies have shown that activation of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor in the colon causes the release of somatostatin from adipocytes, or fat cells, which causes pain relief. In a preclinical study, administration of a rat-selective beta-3 agonist caused a significant, dose-dependent decrease in abdominal arching (a sign of pain) in rats administered mustard oil to cause visceral pain. This pain reduction was reversed by pre-treatment with a somatostatin receptor antagonist, confirming the role of somatostatin in the mechanism of action (treatment with the somatostatin receptor antagonist alone did not alter pain behavior). 
 In Part 1 of a 26-week multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by GlaxoSmithKline plc in 99 IBS patients, treatment with solabegron, another clinical-stage beta-3 agonist, led to an increase of adequate relief of pain and discomfort associated with IBS compared to placebo at six weeks (15%, p=0.061 using last observation carried forward methodology; 22%, p=0.009 using observed cases). Significantly more female patients on active treatment reported a >50% decrease on an 11-point pain score compared to placebo, odds ratio 4.77 (p<0.05); and an increase of over one pain-free-day per week (33.5%) relative to placebo (16.8%) (p<0.05). Twenty-three percent more female patients treated with the beta-3 agonist (54%) achieved adequate relief relative to placebo (31%) (p=0.019). Twenty-five percent more patients with alternating bowel symptoms treated with the beta-3 agonist (60%) achieved adequate relief of pain relative to placebo (35%) (p=0.013). The sponsor only performed efficacy analyses on the initial six-week treatment period. 
 In October 2018, our investigational new drug application, or IND, for a Phase 2a clinical trial of vibegron for the treatment of abdominal pain due to IBS became effective. In December 2018, we enrolled our first patient in this trial. We expect to receive top-line data from the Phase 2a clinical trial in 2020. The Phase 2a trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in women with abdominal pain due to IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) or mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M). The trial is expected to enroll approximately 200 patients in the United States, randomized to receive either 75 mg of vibegron or placebo, administered orally once daily for a 12-week period. The primary endpoint will be a 30% reduction in abdominal pain intensity, while secondary endpoints will include Global Improvement Scale ratings, stool symptoms and safety.

Phase 1 Clinical Trials and Preclinical Studies of Vibegron 
 Our current development plan for vibegron includes multiple Phase 1 clinical trials to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of vibegron, including two recently-completed drug-drug interaction trials (one with rifampin, an antibiotic, and a second with warfarin, an anticoagulant, and metoprolol, taken for high blood pressure), a Phase 1 ambulatory blood pressure study and a Phase 1 food effect and crushed tablet evaluation study. 
 Prior to our license of vibegron, Merck conducted 16 Phase 1 clinical trials in which a total of 465 individuals received at least one dose of vibegron. The Phase 1 program included trials evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of vibegron in healthy young-adult, middle-aged and elderly patients. The Phase 1 program included single doses up to 600 mg (eight times our proposed therapeutic dose), multiple doses up to 400 mg daily for 14 days and 150 mg daily for 28 days. 
 Vibegron was well tolerated throughout the Phase 1 program, including in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment and moderate hepatic impairment. There were no SAEs reported. In addition, in a thorough QTc study, vibegron showed no QTc prolongation at therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. 
 Merck also conducted drug-drug interaction studies with various drugs, including tolterodine ER (anticholinergic for OAB), metoprolol and amlodipine (antihypertensive agents), diltiazem and digoxin (used for treating various heart conditions), ketoconazole (anti-fungal medication), and ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (oral contraceptives). Co-administration of vibegron, which is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, with any of these drugs did not appear to result in a clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction. While CYP3A4 is likely the predominant CYP responsible for in vitro metabolism, metabolism appears to only play a minor role in the elimination of vibegron. In addition, vibegron did not appear to have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives or digoxin. Based on in vitro studies, vibegron is not an inhibitor of any major enzymes produced from the cytochrome P450 genes, including CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Vibegron did not impact the pharmacokinetics of tolterodine ER (a CYP2D6 substrate) in a clinical drug-drug interaction trial, confirming that vibegron is not a CYP2D6 inhibitor. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are important enzymes involved in the metabolism of numerous drugs, the inhibition of which can present drug-drug interaction risk. Drug-drug interactions can lead to clinically significant increased plasma levels of interacting drugs, which may become a safety risk for patients. 
 In vitro assays comparing the potency and selectivity of vibegron with mirabegron found that vibegron was the more potent beta-3 agonist and highly selective relative to beta-1 and beta-2 agonism receptor. The half maximal effective concentration, or EC 50, of vibegron is 2.1 nanomolar at the beta-3 adrenergic receptor. EC50 is a commonly used measure of a drug’s potency, representing the concentration of a drug that induces a response halfway between baseline and maximum after a specified exposure time. Further, vibegron does not appear to bind to either beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptors in binding competition assays, confirming that the compound is neither an agonist nor an antagonist at beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptors. In animal studies, vibegron was observed to induce relaxation in isolated rat urinary smooth bladder muscle, decrease micturition pressure in a rat bladder hyperactivity model in a dose-dependent manner, and increase bladder capacity in rhesus monkeys. Additionally, Merck completed long-term animal toxicity and carcinogenicity studies of vibegron, which are studies required by the FDA prior to approval. 
 URO-902 for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder 
 URO-902 (formerly known as hMaxi-K) is a novel gene therapy product candidate that we are developing for patients with OAB who have failed oral pharmacological therapy. URO-902 is under development as a potential injectable treatment option for smooth muscle-based disorders such as OAB. URO-902 is a plasmid vector containing a human cDNA encoding the pore-forming component of the Maxi-K ion channel. Expression of the Maxi-K protein in muscle cells increases potassium ion flow across the cell membrane, reducing excitability of smooth muscle cells. We believe this mechanism could normalize the heightened detrusor smooth muscle tone in OAB, thereby reducing the symptoms of OAB. We plan to pursue URO-902 as a repeat administration that can be administered under local anesthesia to the bladder wall as an outpatient procedure in a urologist’s office under cystoscopy. 
 15

There are no currently available FDA-approved gene therapy treatments for OAB. With only two non-surgical therapies currently available for treatment of OAB, BOTOX and neuromodulation, we believe there is an opportunity to both capture market share and expand the OAB third-line therapy market. We estimate that only 300,000 patients utilize current third-line procedural therapies that generate aggregate annual sales in excess of $700 million in the U.S. market. We believe a third-line treatment option that is non-surgical and not a toxin, unlike BOTOX, would be appealing to physicians and patients, potentially meeting the unmet needs of this patient population.
We intend to initiate a placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of URO-902 for the treatment of OAB in patients who have not responded to oral pharmacological therapies. The proposed key efficacy endpoints for this Phase 2a clinical trial include reductions per day in micturitions, urgency episodes and UUI episodes. In addition, our design of the Phase 2a clinical trial will consider the safety data and preliminary efficacy data available from the two Phase 1b clinical trials in OAB conducted by ICI. The Biologics License Application for URO-902 will rely primarily on data from our planned Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of URO-902. 
 Clinical Data for URO-902 
 Development of URO-902 was initiated by ICI and has been studied in four clinical trials to date, one Phase 1 clinical trial and one Phase 1b clinical trial in OAB, as well as one Phase 1 clinical trial and one Phase 2a clinical trial in erectile dysfunction. In these trials, URO-902 was studied in a total of 22 women for OAB and 38 men for erectile dysfunction in doses up to 24,000 µg of URO-902. There were no gene transfer-related adverse events or other serious safety issues observed in these trials. There were five SAEs reported across all clinical trials of URO-902 conducted to date, all of which were determined to be unrelated to treatment. Two SAEs occurred at the lowest dose group (500 µg) in the Phase 1 clinical trial in erectile dysfunction (atrial flutter and urinary tract infection). Additionally, one SAE occurred in the 8,000 µg dose group and one SAE occurred in the placebo group in the Phase 2a clinical trial in erectile dysfunction and one SAE occurred in the 16,000 µg dose group in a Phase 1b clinical trial in OAB, each as further described below. 
 In 2017, ICI completed a multicenter, double-blind, imbalanced placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating the potential activity and safety of URO-902 gene transfer by multiple direct injections in women with OAB and detrusor overactivity. The Phase 1b clinical trial, which began in 2014, had two sequential active treatment groups. URO-902 was delivered into the bladder wall by direct injection in a total of 13 female OAB patients at two escalating dose levels of 16,000 µg (n=6) and 24,000 µg (n=3). hMaxi K was observed to be generally well tolerated in this trial. There was one SAE reported in this trial in the 16,000 µg dose group (exacerbation of pre-existing asthma), which was determined to be unrelated to treatment and completely resolved. No other SAEs were reported in this trial. 
 Efficacy results of the trial, which included a limited number of patients (n=13), showed dose-dependent improvements in reductions per day in number of micturitions, urgency episodes and UUI episodes in both URO-902 treatment groups (16,000 µg and 24,000 µg), achieving statistical significance (p<0.05) in the high dose cohort (24,000 µg). Reductions of the measured endpoints in number of micturitions, urgency episodes, UUI episodes and improvements in the measured endpoint of quality of life (as measured by the King’s Health Questionnaire, a commonly used questionnaire designed to evaluate the impact of OAB on quality of life) lasted through the 24-week length of the trial. The improvements for the active treatment groups, in particular the 24,000 µg group, on the King’s Health questionnaire included improvements on the domains of impact on life, physical limitations, social limitations and sleep/energy. 
 In the double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial conducted by ICI in 2007, potential activity and safety of one-time bladder instillation of URO-902 gene transfer in women with OAB and detrusor overactivity was evaluated. The patients were observed for 24 weeks. URO-902 in this trial was instilled into the bladder by catheter in female OAB patients at dose-escalating levels of 5,000 µg and 10,000 µg. Efficacy endpoints included reductions per day in number of micturitions and UUI episodes. No clinically significant changes for the mean number of micturitions or UUI episodes were observed compared to placebo. There were no SAEs reported in this trial. 
 16

In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, randomized Phase 2a clinical trial conducted by ICI in 2017, potential activity and safety of URO-902 gene transfer in men with erectile dysfunction was evaluated. URO-902 was observed to be generally well tolerated in this trial. There were two SAEs reported in this trial (eye surgery for lens replacement and acute Charcot’s osteoarthropathy, in the 8,000 µg group and placebo group, respectively), both of which were not treatment related.

Collaboration Agreement with Kyorin 
 In August 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Kyorin, or the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement, to exchange information relating to non-clinical studies and clinical trials involving vibegron conducted by each party. Pursuant to the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement, Kyorin granted us access and a right of reference to their regulatory materials (and all clinical data contained therein) to develop and commercialize vibegron worldwide (other than the Excluded Asian Territories), and we granted Kyorin access and a right of reference to our regulatory materials (and all clinical data contained therein) to develop and commercialize vibegron in the Excluded Asian Territories, including, in each case, the right to use such materials for any meeting with, or submission to, each party’s relevant government authority for the purpose of obtaining any regulatory approval for vibegron. Further, we granted Kyorin a right of first review and negotiation to obtain a license under the Japanese rights to any urology assets that we acquire during the 10-year period starting from the effective date of the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement, our maximum obligation to Kyorin is $11.5 million, of which $1.0 million was paid during the year ended March 31, 2018. The remaining obligations under this agreement will be due upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones by Kyorin in Japan and us in the United States, subject to certain conditions. 
 The term of the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement continues as long as both parties are developing or commercializing vibegron, unless otherwise terminated or extended. Either party may terminate the Kyorin Collaboration Agreement on 60 days’ written notice for uncured and undisputed material breach, or for the change of control of the other party. 
 Enzyme Supply Agreement with Codexis 
 In September 2017, we entered into an enzyme supply agreement with Codexis, Inc., or Codexis, pursuant to which Codexis agreed to supply its proprietary enzyme, currently used in the production of vibegron, to us on a non-exclusive basis, or the Codexis Agreement. Pursuant to the Codexis Agreement, we agreed to purchase from Codexis all of our requirements for such enzyme (with a minimum purchase commitment totaling $3.75 million) for use in the clinical and commercial production of vibegron worldwide (other than the Excluded Asian Territories) for the first six years after the first approved product in any of the United States, Europe or Canada. Under the Codexis Agreement, Codexis granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicenseable worldwide license to use and import its proprietary enzyme to make, have made, use, import, sell and have sold vibegron worldwide (other than the Excluded Asian Territories). In consideration for these license rights, we also agreed to make a one-time $0.5 million payment upon our achievement of a regulatory milestone in any of the United States, Europe or Canada. 
 The term of the Codexis Agreement continues for six years after the first regulatory approval of vibegron in either the United States, Europe or Canada. We may terminate the Codexis Agreement for any reason, with or without cause, following a written notice to Codexis prior to the first approved product in any of the United States, Europe or Canada. After such time, we may terminate this agreement for any reason, with or without cause, following a written notice to Codexis, but will be obligated to have met our minimum purchase obligations for that year. Either party can terminate the Codexis Agreement with 60 days’ notice for uncured material breach, or with 30 days’ written notice in the event the other party files a voluntary petition, suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets, or is otherwise declared insolvent.

Pursuant to the ICI Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $0.25 million to ICI. Additionally, we agreed to pay ICI up to an aggregate of $35.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events and up to an aggregate of $60.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestone events. Further, we agreed to pay ICI tiered royalties in the mid-to-high single digits on net sales of licensed products made by us, our affiliates or our sublicensees, subject to certain reductions as set forth in the ICI Agreement. Our royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents expires with respect to a given product in a given country. 
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval of at least one licensed product. Under the ICI Agreement, we control prosecution, defense and enforcement of the licensed patents, and ICI has backup rights to prosecution, defense and enforcement with respect to any licensed patents for which we elect not to exercise such rights. 
 The ICI Agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis on the expiration of the royalty term with respect to a given licensed product, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the ICI Agreement in its entirety, or on a product-by-product basis, for any reason, with or without cause, upon 90 days’ written notice or, if after regulatory approval of a licensed product, upon 180 days’ written notice. Either party may terminate the ICI Agreement with 90 days’ written notice for uncured material breach, or immediately in the event the other party files a voluntary petition, is subject to an involuntary petition not dismissed within 90 days, or assigns a substantial portion of its assets for the benefit of creditors. 
 Loan Agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc.
 On February 20, 2019, we and our subsidiaries, Urovant Holdings Limited (“UHL”), Urovant Sciences GmbH (“USG”) (collectively with us and UHL, the “Borrowers”) and Urovant Sciences, Inc. (“USI”) (collectively with the Borrowers, the “Loan Parties”) entered into a secured debt financing agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with Hercules Capital, Inc. (“Hercules”), as agent and lender, in the amount of $100.0 million (the “Term Loans”). A first tranche of $15.0 million was funded upon execution of the Loan Agreement, and the remaining $85.0 million is available in three additional optional tranches through June 30, 2021, subject to certain terms and conditions, including the achievement of certain milestones. 
 The Term Loans bear a variable interest rate equal to the greater of (i) 10.15% or (ii) the lesser of (x) the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal plus 4.65% and (y) 12.15%. We are obligated to make monthly payments of accrued interest for the first 12 months from closing, or the Interest-only Period, followed by monthly installments of principal and interest through the maturity date. The Interest-only Period may be extended up to an aggregate of 24 months after closing if certain milestones are met. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries of the Borrowers, including USI. The Loan Parties’ obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest on substantially all of their personal property, other than intellectual property, and subject to certain other exceptions. 
 The Term Loans mature 36 months from closing and include an option for the Loan Parties to extend the maturity date up to 18 months if certain milestones are met. The Loan Parties have the option to prepay the Terms Loans and the prepayment of the Term Loans will be subject to, in some circumstances, a prepayment charge equal to 2% in the first 12 months from closing, 1% in the second 12 months, and 0% thereafter. Upon repayment of the Term Loans, the Company will be obligated to pay an end of term charge in an amount equal to 4.25% of the amount of the Term Loans actually advanced.

defaults in respect of certain other indebtedness, certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency and certain events relating to U.K. or Irish pension plans. If any event of default occurs, the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding amounts under the Term Loans may become due and payable immediately. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (subject, in certain instances, to specified grace periods) and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations under the Loan Agreement would automatically become due and payable. 
 In connection with each funding of the Term Loans, we are required to issue to Hercules a warrant, or the Warrants, to purchase a number of our common shares equal to 2% of the principal amount of the relevant Term Loan funded divided by the exercise price, which will be based on the closing price of our common shares on the business day immediately prior to the relevant Term Loan funding (or for the first and second tranches only at the lower of (i) $9.02 per share or (ii) the closing price of our common shares on the business day immediately prior to the relevant Term Loan funding). The Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis, and are immediately exercisable through the seventh anniversary of the applicable funding date. The number of common shares for which each Warrant is exercisable and the associated exercise price are subject to certain proportional adjustments as set forth in such Warrant. In connection with the first tranche of the Term Loans, we issued a Warrant to Hercules, exercisable for an aggregate of 33,259 of our common shares at an exercise price of $9.02 per share.
 Urovant is a Vant within the Roivant Family of Companies 
 We have benefited from our ability to leverage the Roivant model and the greater Roivant platform. The period of time between our formation and our operational maturation was shortened based on the support from centralized Roivant functions available to us since our creation. This includes operational functions as well as access to Roivant’s proprietary technology and digital innovation platforms. Consistent with its model, Roivant has also provided us with access to an embedded team of scientific experts, physicians and technologists to help optimize the clinical development and commercial strategies of the company. We intend to explore collaborations with other Vants within the Roivant family of companies, including Alyvant, to optimize the launch of vibegron. Additionally, in the future, we may have the ability to benefit from Roivant’s economies of scale and scope, including but not limited to the opportunity to: 
  
• | leverage Roivant’s business development engine and vast network of industry relationships for the identification of, and access to, new assets and synergistic partnerships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enter channel partnerships with other Vants in the Roivant family of companies (including but not limited to technology-focused Vants built by Roivant, such as Alyvant), with the goal of delivering efficiencies in the development and commercialization process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | access Roivant’s human capital engine to recruit new employees from within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enable our employees to participate in Roivant’s career development program which facilitates employee mobility across Vants in the Roivant family of companies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | benefit from shared learnings, best practices, and external industry relationships across the Roivant family of companies; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive certain benefits of scale upon becoming a commercial-stage company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Distribution 
 We do not currently have our own sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize vibegron, if approved for commercial sale, we must develop a sales infrastructure. We intend to build an initial sales force of approximately 150 persons in the United States, targeting urologists and other specialists that treat a high number of patients with urologic conditions. We believe these physicians have a significant number of OAB patients in their practice and often serve as the diagnosing and treating physicians for OAB. We intend to scale the commercial presence to reach additional health care professionals as vibegron sales grow. We believe that our commercial leadership team, with experience launching over 20 prescription products, positions us well to efficiently pursue the significant market opportunity for vibegron in the United States. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for vibegron inside and outside the United States. 
 20

Manufacturing 
 We do not have the capabilities to conduct drug formulation or manufacturing and do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. While vibegron and URO-902 were being developed by Merck and ICI, respectively, it was also being manufactured by Merck and through contract manufacturing organizations by ICI. 
 We expect that the vibegron drug substance transferred to us under the Merck Agreement and drug substance manufactured at our planned commercial supplier will be sufficient for us to complete our currently planned clinical trials for the treatment of OAB in men with BPH and abdominal pain due to IBS. We have also contracted with a third party to fill, finish, supply, store and distribute the vibegron drug product for such purpose. If vibegron is approved by the FDA for commercial use, we will rely on third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of vibegron to be used for the commercialization of vibegron. If we are unable to initiate or continue our relationships with one or more other third-party manufacturers, we could experience delays in our commercialization efforts as we locate and qualify new manufacturers. 
 Vibegron is a small molecule that can be manufactured using commercially available technologies. We acquired data from Merck related to the chemical synthesis and manufacturing of vibegron, and we have contracted with third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of vibegron ingredients on a cost-efficient basis based on our understanding of the structure and synthesis of the compound. We currently rely on a single supplier, Codexis, for its proprietary enzyme, which we use in the production of vibegron, and we have agreed to purchase from Codexis all of our requirements for such enzyme for use in our clinical and commercial production of vibegron for the first six years after the first approval of vibegron in any of the United States, Europe or Canada. We are currently exploring alternative options for the synthesis of vibegron to enable us to identify and utilize a second source supplier. While we continue to explore these alternatives, we plan to build and maintain two years of inventory of vibegron using the Codexis enzyme prior to any regulatory approval. 
 URO-902 is a naked DNA plasmid vector containing a cDNA encoding the pore-forming component of the human smooth muscle Maxi-K ion channel. We expect the manufacturing process for URO-902 to be typical for that of biologics. Prior to our acquisition of URO-902, it was developed and manufactured in academic and manufacturing facilities suitable to support manufacturing of early clinical de
velopment. We expect our existing supply of URO-902, which was transferred to us under the ICI license agreement, to be sufficient for us to complete our planned Phase 2a study if materials continue to meet all specifications. We have recently contracted with a third-party vendor for the manufacturing of URO-902 for future preclinical studies and clinical trials, but the vendor has not yet manufactured any URO-902. We intend to contract with third-party vendors for commercialization if and when URO-902 receives marketing approval. We have not determined at this time whether to develop our own technology and process or to use third-party patented or proprietary DNA delivery-related technology for the manufacture and commercialization of URO-902. If we are unable to initiate or continue our relationships with one or more third-party manufacturers for the development and manufacture of URO-902, we could experience delays in our development efforts, and subsequent commercialization if approved. 
 Manufacturing of any product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans. 
 Competition 
 We expect mirabegron (Myrbetriq, marketed by Astellas) to be our primary competitor for the treatment of OAB. Mirabegron, a beta-3 agonist, is marketed for the treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency. 
 In addition to vibegron, solabegron is the only other beta-3 agonist that is in clinical development. GlaxoSmithKline plc conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial in which solabegron, dosed twice daily, demonstrated efficacy in OAB. Velicept Therapeutics, Inc., which has acquired the rights to solabegron, has developed a once-daily formulation and is advancing both its twice-daily and once-daily formulations into Phase 2b clinical trials. 
 21

Additionally, there are several other product candidates under development for the treatment of OAB. Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is developing TAC-302, a novel neurite outgrowth enhancer, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials in Japan. Dong-A ST Co., Ltd. is developing DA-8010, a novel anticholinergic, currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Taris Biomedical LLC is developing TAR-302, an intravesical drug-delivery system for trospium, an anticholinergic drug, currently in Phase 1b clinical trials. Outpost Medicine, LLC’s IND for OP-687 for OAB was accepted by the FDA in late 2017. In addition, a number of companies are developing injectable neurotoxins (biosimilar onabotulinumtoxinA, abobotulinumtoxinA, and nivobotulinumtoxinA) for OAB, and Allergan has advanced a BOTOX-based sustained release gel (RTGel) for the treatment of OAB into Phase 2 clinical development. 
 We also face significant competition from traditional anticholinergic drugs, which have been the standard of pharmacologic care for OAB since the approval of flavoxate in 1970 and oxybutynin in 1975. Anticholinergics continue to account for the largest share of prescriptions written for the treatment of OAB in the United States. There are a number of widely prescribed anticholinergics approved for sale in the United States, including solifenacin, tolterodine and oxybutynin. In addition, procedural therapies, such as BOTOX (marketed by Allergan) and neuromodulation are available as third-line treatments for OAB. 
 Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, reimbursement and public opinion. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Additionally, we expect our gene therapy product candidate, URO-902, to face significant competition from our competitors focused on more traditional therapies for OAB due to perceived risks and public perception associated with gene therapies. 
 Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. 
 Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for any of our indications by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for vibegron and any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the products or processes may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates. 
 22

Following our execution of the Merck Agreement, as of February 3, 2017, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the Merck Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions (including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada, but excluding China and the Excluded Asian Territories) relating to beta-3 agonists, including vibegron. As they relate to vibegron, these patents and patent applications cover the vibegron molecule and salts and stereoisomers thereof as a composition of matter, the use of vibegron to treat overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, UUI and urinary urgency, as well as methods of manufacturing. The patent family directed to the vibegron composition of matter and methods of use naturally expires in 2029 in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular jurisdiction. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, has determined that one such patent within the composition of matter and methods of use patent family is entitled to 608 days of patent term adjustment. The patents and patent applications (if issued) directed to methods of manufacturing beta-3 agonists (including vibegron) and related synthetic intermediates would naturally expire between 2032 and 2034, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. For example, the term of certain of the composition of matter patents for vibegron in the United States may be extended up to about five years under the patent term extension provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. In addition to the patent rights licensed from Merck, we also have two international patent applications directed to use of vibegron at certain dosages to treat overactive bladder. 
 Following our execution of the ICI Agreement, as of August 24, 2018, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the ICI Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of a pending international patent application relating to URO-902 gene therapy. This patent application covers the use of URO-902 gene therapy to treat signs or symptoms of overactive bladder or detrusor overactivity. Any patents issuing from this application would naturally expire in 2038, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a period due to delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 We have a trademark registration in the United States for UROVANT, as well as pending trademark applications in the United States for UROVANT SCIENCES. Under the Merck Agreement, we have the right to market vibegron worldwide (other than the Excluded Asian Territories) under the trademark(s) of our choice, subject to regulatory approval. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our products or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation 
 FDA Drug Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or biologics license applications, or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
 We cannot market a drug or biological product candidate in the United States until the product candidate has received FDA approval. The steps required before a product may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, in the case of biological product candidates, including gene therapy product candidates, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug or biological product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the FDA will place the IND on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP requirements, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 24

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose a clinical hold or other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval at each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 U.S. Pharmaceutical and Biological Products Development Process 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval of pharmaceutical product candidates are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug or biologic product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal or registration trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug or biologic. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic product candidate. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA and BLA are also subject to annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of application. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs to treat serious conditions that the FDA determines offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug or biologic product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the product is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 25

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The requirement for a REMS can adversely affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new application or application supplement before the change can be implemented. An application supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing application supplements as it does in reviewing applications. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or application supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidates for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 Once an application is approved, a product is subject to pervasive and ongoing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse events, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 26

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP requirements after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacture of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, “Dear Healthcare Provider” letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Additional Requirements for U.S. Biological Products Development Process 
 Our gene therapy product candidate will be regulated by FDA as a biologic, which, in addition to the pharmaceutical development pathway described above, requires compliance with certain product-specific regulations. 
 Compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines, is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Under these guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.

Prior to August 2018, the NIH guidelines also required human gene transfer protocols to be submitted for review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, where (1) an oversight body such as an IBC or an IRB determined that the protocol would significantly benefit from RAC review, and (2) the protocol (a) used a new vector, genetic material, or delivery methodology that represents a first-in-human experience and thus presents an unknown risk, and/or (b) relied on preclinical safety data that were obtained using a new preclinical model system of unknown and unconfirmed value, and/or (c) involved a proposed vector, gene construct, or method of delivery associated with possible toxicities that are not widely known and that may render it difficult for oversight bodies to evaluate the protocol rigorously. On August 17, 2018, the NIH issued a notice in the Federal Register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials, including changes to the applicable NIH guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the RAC with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products, and requesting public comment. During the public comment period, which closed October 16, 2018, the NIH has announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols or convene the RAC to review individual clinical protocols. These trials will remain subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and the roles and responsibilities of the IBC at the local level will continue as described in the NIH Guidelines. 
 The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. 
 The NIH and the FDA have a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System, which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies. 
 After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by health care providers and patients and to assess product complaints. 
 Market and Data Exclusivity for Biological Products 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the PPACA, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term. 
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a licensed biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of licensure of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed by FDA. The BPCIA also requires a 180-day notice of commercial marketing of a biosimilar to the reference product manufacturer. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own nonclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.

Foreign Regulation 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, referrals or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the PPACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties, plus up to three times the remuneration involved for each violation. Civil penalties and treble damages also can be assessed under the federal False Claims Act for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In addition, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
 29

The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,181 and $22,363 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations of the false claims laws also may implicate various federal criminal statutes. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. As it did for the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity. At present, it is unclear if we would be considered a business associate subject to HIPAA based on our business activities and service offerings upon the commercialization of a product. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. 
 30

Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, or information related to drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sell any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada or the European Union, we may be subject to additional regulation. 
 Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 We and our subsidiaries are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, and agents. However, our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement activity by both the Department of Justice and the SEC. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
Other Applicable Laws
 We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations, both in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate, as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, on which our common shares are traded.
 We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants.
 31

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
 We are also subject to or affected by federal, state and foreign privacy, security and data protection laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance that govern the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data. Our operations extend to countries around the world, and many of these jurisdictions have established privacy legal frameworks with which we, our customers or our vendors must comply.
 Health Reform 
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to healthcare systems that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 
 In particular, PPACA has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. This law was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, PPACA revises the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, effective April 1, 2016, that, among other things, revises the manner in which the AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under PPACA. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and other provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. 
 We cannot predict the full impact of PPACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions, some of which have not yet fully occurred.
 Further, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of PPACA. Since January 2017, the President of the United States has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of PPACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the President of the United States signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of PPACA. 
 Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and non-severable feature of PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of PPACA are invalid as well. The Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. Although we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to PPACA or other federal and state reform efforts, we continue to evaluate the effect that PPACA, as amended or replaced, will have on our business. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidate. 
 32

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the President of the United States signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
 Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years beginning in 2015. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our products, if and when approved. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors. 
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. 
 33

Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the United Kingdom, or UK, held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, or EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK and the EU, and this uncertainty may persist for years. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the UK covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. In addition, withdrawal could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. This is particularly the case if the UK and the EU do not reach agreement on how the UK will exit the EU, commonly referred to as “hard Brexit.” The UK’s vote to exit the EU could also result in similar referendums or votes in other European countries in which we do business. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU would have and how such withdrawal would affect us.
 Financial History
 We have never been profitable, have incurred significant losses since our inception and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and may never generate any revenue from product sales.
 On February 20, 2019, we and our subsidiaries, entered into the Loan Agreement, a secured debt financing agreement, with Hercules, as agent and lender, in the amount of $100.0 million. As of March 31, 2019, a total of $85.0 million remained available to us under the Loan Agreement. We have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares in our initial public offering, capital contributions from our parent company, RSL, and the financing commitment from Hercules. Additional information regarding this financing commitment is included in Note 5, “Long-term debt,” to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The majority of our operating expense is related to research and development activities. Our research and development activities primarily include activities related to the Phase 3 development of our lead product candidate, vibegron, for the treatment of OAB, as well as for the treatment of OAB in men with BPH and our Phase 2a clinical trial for the treatment of abdominal pain due to IBS. Our research and development expenses totaled $92.2 million and $32.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect our net losses, negative cash flows, and operating expenses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, and grow our company.
 As of March 31, 2019, we had approximately $85.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and $85.0 million of financing commitments available to us under the Hercules Loan Agreement. 
 We manage our operations and allocate resources as a single operating and reporting segment. Additional financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our net loss for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 and our total assets as of March 31, 2019 and 2018, is included in our consolidated financial statements in Part II. Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
