ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General 
 Our Company 
 We are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. Since we began our investment activities in July 2011, through December 31, 2021, we have originated approximately $20.1 billion aggregate principal amount of investments and retained approximately $8.4 billion aggregate principal amount of these investments on our balance sheet prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We seek to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle-market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity securities. By “middle-market companies,” we mean companies that have annual earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies on occasion. As of December 31, 2021, our core portfolio companies, which exclude certain investments that fall outside of our typical borrower profile and represent 88.8% of our total investments based on fair value, had weighted average annual revenue of $114.4 million and weighted average annual EBITDA of $32.3 million. 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. 
 We have operated as a business development company, or a BDC, since we began our investment activities in July 2011. In conducting our investment activities, we believe that we benefit from the significant scale and resources of our Adviser and its affiliates. 
 The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations (including restructurings). We invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt, mezzanine and unsecured debt and equity and other investments. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans; “last out” first-lien loans, which are loans that have a secondary priority behind super-senior “first out” first-lien loans; “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position; and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt. As of December 31, 2021, based on fair value our portfolio consisted of 91.2% first-lien debt investments, 1.7% second-lien debt investments, 0.7% mezzanine investments, and 6.4% equity and other investments. As of December 31, 2021, 98.9% of our debt investments based on fair value bore interest at floating rates (when including investment specific hedges), with 99.4% of these subject to interest rate floors, which we believe helps act as a portfolio-wide hedge against inflation. As of December 31, 2021 we had investments in 72 portfolio companies, with an average investment size of approximately $35.0 million based on fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the largest single investment based on fair value represented 3.4% of our total investment portfolio. 
 As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio was invested across 15 different industries. The largest industries in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 were business services and retail and consumer products, which represented, as a percentage of our portfolio, 16.8%, and 12.3% respectively, based on fair value. 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. As a consequence of our BDC and RIC elections, our portfolio is and will continue to be subject to diversification and other requirements to maintain such status elections. 
 We borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act to fund investments and for general corporate purposes. Under the 1940 Act, we can incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance our ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 150%. In determining whether to borrow money, we analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, as well as the risks of those borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds 
 4


of preferred stock offerings to make investments has its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock are borne by us, and ultimately the holders of our common stock. See “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and increases the risk of investing in us.” See also “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities.”
 Our operations comprise only a single reportable segment. 
 Relationship with our Adviser, and Sixth Street 
 Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator, and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on us, which we refer to as our Investment Team. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser’s Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser’s Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and Sixth Street Partners, LLC or “Sixth Street.” 
 Sixth Street is a global investment business with approximately $60 billion of assets under management. Sixth Street’s core platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations, Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street’s private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm’s “public-side” credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 370 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2021, thirty three (33) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty five (25) investment professionals.
 Our Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with the breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street’s market expertise, insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us. 
 On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain “follow-on” investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On December 28, 2021, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. There can be no assurance when or if the SEC will grant a further order in response to our application. Until such time a new order is granted, we will continue to operate under the terms of our current exemptive order.
 We believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide “one-stop” financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Transactions with our affiliates.”
 The Adviser is responsible for managing our day-to-day business affairs, including implementing investment policies and strategic initiatives set by our Investment Team and managing our portfolio under the general oversight of our Investment Review Committee. 
 On April 15, 2011, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement was subsequently amended on December 12, 2011. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to us. 
 5


The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee. For a discussion of the Management Fee and Incentive Fee payable by us to the Adviser, see “Management Agreements—Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement.” Our Board monitors the mix and performance of our investments over time and seeks to satisfy itself that the Adviser is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Adviser to do so. 
 In November 2021, our Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2022, and may be extended subject to required approvals. 
 Investment Criteria/Guidelines 
 Investment Decision Process 
 Our investment approach involves, among other things: 
  
• | an assessment of the markets, overall macroeconomic environment and how the assessment may impact industry and investment selection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | substantial company-specific research and analysis; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | with respect to each individual company, an emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility and management of downside risk.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The foundation of our investment philosophy incorporates intensive analysis, a management discipline based on both market technicals and fundamental value-oriented research, and consideration of diversification within our portfolio. We follow a rigorous investment process based on: 
  
• | a comprehensive analysis of issuer creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the issuer’s business;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an evaluation of management and its economic incentives;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | an analysis of business strategy and industry trends; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | an in-depth examination of a prospective portfolio company’s capital structure, financial results and projections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We seek to identify those companies exhibiting superior fundamental risk-reward profiles and strong defensible business franchises, while focusing on the absolute and relative value of the investment. 
 Investment Process Overview 
 Origination and Sourcing 
 The substantial majority of our investments are not intermediated and are originated without the assistance of investment banks or other traditional Wall Street sources. In addition to executing direct calling campaigns on companies based on the Adviser’s sector and macroeconomic views, our Investment Team also maintains direct contact with financial sponsors, banks, corporate advisory firms, industry consultants, attorneys, investment banks, “club” investors and other potential sources of investment opportunities. The substantial majority of our deals are informed by our current sector views and are sourced directly by our Adviser through our network of contacts. We also identify opportunities through our Adviser’s relationships with Sixth Street. 
Due Diligence Process 
 The process through which an investment decision is made involves extensive research into the company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the investment team responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we will engage in an intensive due diligence process. Though each transaction will involve a somewhat different approach, our diligence of each opportunity may include: 

• | understanding the purpose of the capital requirement, the key personnel and variables, as well as the sources and uses of the proceeds;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | meeting the company’s management, including top and middle-level executives, to get an insider’s view of the business, and to probe for potential weaknesses in business prospects;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6


 
• | checking management’s backgrounds and references;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | performing a detailed review of historical financial performance, including performance through various economic cycles, and the quality of earnings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and standard practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the company to its main competitors on an operating, financial, market share and valuation basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | researching the industry for historic growth trends and future prospects as well as to identify future exit alternatives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging Sixth Street internal resources with institutional knowledge of the company’s business; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | investigating legal and regulatory risks and financial and accounting systems and practices.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selective Investment Process 
 After an investment has been identified and preliminary diligence has been completed, a credit research and analysis report is prepared. This report is reviewed by senior investment professionals. If these senior and other investment professionals are supportive of pursuing the potential investment, then a more extensive due diligence process is employed. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys, independent accountants, and other third-party consultants and research firms prior to the closing of the investment, as appropriate, on a case-by-case basis. 
Issuance of Formal Commitment 
 Approval of an investment requires the approval of the Investment Review Committee. Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management or financial sponsor of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, if any, to finalize the structure and terms of the investment. 
Portfolio Monitoring 
 The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. 
 The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, which may include the following: 
  
• | assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparisons to other companies in the industry;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
  
• | An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company’s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company’s operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 7


 
• | An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying its obligations to us as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its “watch list” and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments on its obligations to us. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with the portfolio company’s senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest and/or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investment on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration of our investment. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For more information on the investment performance ratings of our portfolio, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—Portfolio and Investment Activity.”
 Investment Review Committee 
 The Adviser manages our portfolio under the general oversight of the Investment Review Committee. The Investment Review Committee includes certain individuals who are senior personnel of the Adviser and Sixth Street, as well as certain other persons appointed by the Adviser from time to time. Our Investment Team and the Investment Review Committee are supported by and have access to the investment professionals, analytical capabilities and support personnel of Sixth Street. 
Structure of Investments 
 Since beginning our investment activities in July 2011, we have sought to generate current income primarily in U.S.-domiciled middle market companies through direct originations of senior secured loans and, to a lesser extent, originations of mezzanine and unsecured loans and investments in corporate bonds and equity and other investments. 
Debt Investments 
 The terms of our debt investments are tailored to the facts and circumstances of each transaction and prospective portfolio company. We negotiate the structure of each investment to protect our rights and manage our risk while providing funding to help the portfolio company achieve its business plan. We invest in the following types of debt: 

• | First-lien debt. First-lien debt is typically senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer’s capital structure and has the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets. Our first-lien debt may include stand-alone first-lien loans, “last out” first-lien loans, “unitranche” loans and secured corporate bonds with similar features to these categories of first-lien loans.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stand-alone first-lien loans. Stand-alone first-lien loans are traditional first-lien loans. All lenders in the facility have equal rights to the collateral that is subject to the first-priority security interest.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Last out” first-lien loans. “Last out” first-lien loans have a secondary priority behind super-senior “first out” first-lien loans in the collateral securing the loans in certain circumstances. The arrangements for a “last out” first-lien loan are set forth in an “agreement among lenders,” which provides lenders with “first out” and “last out” payment streams based on a single lien on the collateral. Since the “first out” lenders generally have priority over the “last out” lenders for receiving payment under certain specified events of default, or upon the occurrence of other triggering events under intercreditor agreements or agreements among lenders, the “last out” lenders bear a greater risk and, in exchange, receive a higher effective interest rate, through arrangements among the lenders, than the “first out” lenders or lenders in stand-alone first-lien loans. Agreements among lenders also typically provide greater voting rights to the “last out” lenders than the intercreditor agreements to which second-lien lenders often are subject.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Unitranche” loans. Unitranche loans combine features of first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine debt, generally in a first-lien position. In many cases, we may provide the borrower most, if not all, of the capital structure above the equity. The primary advantages to the borrower are the ability to negotiate the entire debt financing with one lender and the elimination of intercreditor issues.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8


 
• | Second-lien debt. Our second-lien debt may include secured loans, and, to a lesser extent, secured corporate bonds, with a secondary priority behind first-lien debt. Second-lien debt typically is senior on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer’s capital structure and has the benefit of a security interest over assets of the issuer, though ranking junior to first-lien debt secured by those assets. First-lien lenders and second-lien lenders typically have separate liens on the collateral, and an intercreditor agreement provides the first-lien lenders with priority over the second-lien lenders’ liens on the collateral.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Mezzanine” and “Unsecured” debt. Structurally, mezzanine debt usually ranks subordinate in priority of payment to first-lien and second-lien debt and may not have the benefit of financial covenants common in first-lien and second-lien debt. Unsecured debt may rank junior as it relates to proceeds in certain liquidations where it does not have the benefit of a lien in specific collateral held by creditors (typically first lien and/or second lien) who have a perfected security interest in such collateral. However, both mezzanine and unsecured debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in an issuer’s capital structure. Mezzanine and unsecured debt investments generally offer lenders fixed returns in the form of interest payments and mezzanine debt will often provide lenders an opportunity to participate in the capital appreciation, if any, of an issuer through an equity interest. This equity interest typically takes the form of an equity co-investment or warrants. Due to its higher risk profile and often less restrictive covenants compared to senior secured loans, mezzanine and unsecured debt generally bears a higher stated interest rate than first-lien and second-lien debt.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our debt investments are typically structured with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our total return target. We seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by: 
  
• | requiring a total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with preservation of our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative covenants (including reporting requirements), negative covenants (including financial covenants), lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or rights to a seat on the board under some circumstances.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Among the types of first-lien debt in which we invest, we generally are able to obtain higher effective interest rates on our “last out” first-lien loans than on other types of first-lien loans, since our “last-out” first-lien loans generally are more junior in the capital structure. Within our portfolio, we aim to maintain the appropriate proportion among the various types of first-lien loans, as well as second-lien debt and mezzanine debt, which allows us to achieve our target returns while maintaining our targeted amount of credit risk. 
 Equity and Other Investments 
 Our loans may include an equity interest in the issuer, such as a warrant or profit participation right. In certain instances, we also will make equity investments, although those situations are generally limited to those cases where we are also making an investment in a more senior part of the capital structure of the issuer. 
Investments 
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had made investments with an aggregate fair value of $2,521.6 million and $2,298.9 million, respectively, in 72 and 70 portfolio companies, respectively.

Other Commitments and Contingencies
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. 
 From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of December 31, 2021, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure.
 Competition 
 We compete for investments with a number of capital providers, including BDCs, other investment funds (including private debt and equity funds and venture capital funds), special purpose acquisition company sponsors, investment banks with underwriting activities, hedge funds that invest in private investments in public equities, traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks, and other sources of financing, including the broadly syndicated loan market and high yield capital market. Many of these capital providers have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we expect to face, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.” 
 Capital Resources and Borrowings 
 We anticipate generating cash in the future from cash flows from operations, including interest received on our cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, and through issuances of common stock. 
 Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage was 205.4% and 204.5%, respectively. See “Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities” below. 
 Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders (which may cause us to fail to distribute amounts necessary to avoid entity-level taxation under the Code), or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In addition, we must also comply with positive and negative covenants customary for these types of facilities. 
 Our debt obligations consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

For more information on our debt, see “ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS——Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
 Dividend Policy 
 To maintain our status as a RIC, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as well as other taxable income, excluding any net capital gains reduced by deductible expenses) and 90% of our net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to stockholders. In addition, to avoid the imposition of a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 

• | 98% of our net ordinary income, excluding certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized during a calendar year;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have previously incurred, and can be expected to incur in the future, such excise tax on a portion of our income and gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the excise tax entirely. In that event, we will be liable for the excise tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.”

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash dividends or distributions declared by the Board on behalf of investors who do not elect to receive their cash dividends or distributions in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, then our stockholders who have not elected to “opt out” of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional common stock as described below. 
 Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive cash dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
 No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have its cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in our common stock. A registered stockholder is able to elect to receive an entire cash dividend or distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing, so that notice is received by the plan administrator no later than 10 days prior to the record date for the cash dividend or distributions to the stockholders. The plan administrator has set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive cash dividends or distributions in cash and hold the shares in non-certificated form. 
 We expect to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. We reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable to a stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or “NYSE,” on the payment date of a distribution, or if no sale is reported for such day, the average of the reported bid and ask prices. However, if the market price per share on the payment date of a cash dividend or distribution exceeds the most recently computed net asset value per share, we will issue shares at the greater of (i) the most recently computed net asset value per share and (ii) 95% of the current market price per share (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeded the most recently computed net asset value per share). Shares purchased in open market transactions by the plan administrator will be allocated to a stockholder based on the average purchase price, excluding any brokerage charges or other charges, of all shares of common stock purchased in the open market. 
 The number of shares of our common stock that will be outstanding after giving effect to payment of a cash dividend or distribution cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our stockholders have been tabulated. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder pursuant to the foregoing will be rounded down to the nearest whole share to avoid the issuance of fractional shares, with any fractional shares being paid in cash. For non-U.S. stockholders, the number of shares to be issued to the stockholder will be the amount equal to the total dollar amount of the cash dividend or distribution payable, net of applicable withholding taxes. 
 There are no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in the plan. The plan is terminable by us upon notice in writing mailed to each stockholder of record at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any cash dividend or distribution by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant’s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a brokerage commission from the proceeds.
 Administration 
 Each of our executive officers is an employee of our Adviser or its affiliates. We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Individuals who are employees of our Adviser or its affiliates provide services necessary for our business under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Adviser and the services necessary for the origination and administration of our investment portfolio are provided by investment professionals employed by our Adviser or its affiliates. Our Investment Team focuses on origination and transaction development and the ongoing monitoring of our investments. In addition, we reimburse the Adviser for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). See “Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement” below.
 In addition to our Adviser, Sixth Street has a team of over 370 investment and operating professionals. As of December 31, 2021, thirty three (33) of these personnel are dedicated to our business, including twenty five (25) investment professionals.

Management Agreements 
 Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement 
 On April 15, 2011, we entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with our Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement was subsequently amended on December 12, 2011. 
 Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser: 
  
• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing those changes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determines the assets we will originate, purchase, retain or sell;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closes, monitors and administers the investments we make, including the exercise of any rights in our capacity as a lender or equity holder; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provides us other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds, including providing operating and managerial assistance to us and our portfolio companies, as required.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to us are not impaired. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay the Adviser a base management fee, or the “Management Fee,” and may also pay certain incentive fees, or “Incentive Fees”. 
 The Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% based on the average value of our gross assets calculated using the values at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. 
 For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Management Fees (gross of waivers) were $37.1 million, $32.1 million and $30.1 million, respectively.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, Management Fees of $0.2 million were waived consisting solely of Management Fees pursuant to the Leverage Waiver. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
 Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. 
 The Adviser intends to waive a portion of the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement by reducing the Management Fee on assets financed using leverage over 200% asset coverage (in other words, over 1.0x debt to equity) (the “Leverage Waiver”). Pursuant to the Leverage Waiver, the Adviser intends to waive the portion of the Management Fee in excess of an annual rate of 1.0% (0.250% per quarter) on the average value of our gross assets as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters that exceeds the product of (i) 200% and (ii) the average value of our net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For the year ended December 30, 2021, Management Fees of $0.2 million, have been waived pursuant to the Leverage Waiver. The Adviser did not waive any Management Fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 pursuant to the Leverage Waiver.
 The Incentive Fee consists of two parts, as follows: 
  
(i) | The first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equals 100% of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a 1.5% quarterly “hurdle rate,” the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser has received 17.5% of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% quarterly, 17.5% of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The 100% “catch-up” provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the 1.5% “hurdle rate” is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of 17.5% on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals 1.82% in a quarter (7.28% annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the “hurdle rate” is reached and catch-up is achieved, 17.5% of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of 1.82% in any quarter is payable to the Adviser.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends, interest and fee income accrued by us during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration 
 15


Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we may not have received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. 
  
(ii) | The second component, payable at the end of each fiscal year in arrears, equaled 15% through March 31, 2014 and, beginning April 1, 2014, equals a weighted percentage of cumulative realized capital gains from our inception to the end of that fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital losses. This component of the Incentive Fee is referred to as the Capital Gains Fee. Each year, the fee paid for this component of the Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for prior periods. For capital gains that accrue following March 31, 2014, the Incentive Fee rate is 17.5%. We accrue, but do not pay, a capital gains Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized capital gains because a capital gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if we were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The weighted percentage is intended to ensure that for each fiscal year following the completion of the IPO, the portion of our realized capital gains that accrued prior to March 31, 2014, is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of 15% and the portion of our realized capital gains that accrued beginning April 1, 2014 is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of 17.5%. As of March 31, 2020, there are no remaining investments that were made prior to April 1, 2014, and as a result, the Incentive Fee rate of 17.5% is applicable to any future realized capital gains.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For purposes of determining whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.  
 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. Because of the structure of the Incentive Fee, it is possible that we may pay an Incentive Fee in a quarter in which we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable Incentive Fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. In addition, because the quarterly minimum hurdle rate is calculated based on our net assets, decreases in our net assets due to realized or unrealized capital losses in any given quarter may increase the likelihood that the hurdle rate is reached and therefore the likelihood of us paying an Incentive Fee for that quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the Management Fee because gross assets are total assets (including cash received) before deducting liabilities (such as declared dividend payments). 
 Section 205(b)(3) of the Advisers Act, as amended, prohibits the Adviser from receiving the payment of fees on unrealized gains until those gains are realized, if ever. There can be no assurance that such unrealized gains will be realized in the future. 
 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Incentive Fees were $46.6 million, $32.9 million and $27.2 million, respectively, of which $33.1 million, $31.5 million, and $27.2 million, respectively, were realized and payable to the Adviser. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $13.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of Incentive Fees were accrued related to cumulative unrealized capital gains in excess of cumulative net realized capital gains less any cumulative unrealized losses and capital gains Incentive Fees paid inception to date. As of December 31, 2021, these accrued Incentive Fees are not contractually payable to the Adviser. For the year ended December 31, 2019, no Incentive Fees were accrued related to capital gains. 
 The Adviser did not waive any Incentive Fees for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Any waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser.
 Since our IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees and certain Incentive Fees attributable to our ownership of certain investments and the Leverage Waiver, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive any Management Fees or Incentive Fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
 In November 2021, the Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2022, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days’ written notice to the other party. 
 Our Board monitors the mix and performance of our investments over time and seeks to satisfy itself that the Adviser is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Adviser to do so. 
 On March 15, 2011, we entered into the Administration Agreement with our Adviser. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office 
 16


services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. See “—Payment of Our Expenses” below. In addition, the Adviser is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties and we pay or reimburse the Adviser expenses incurred by any such affiliates or third parties for work done on our behalf. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we incurred expenses of $4.8 million, $3.8 million, and $4.2 million, respectively, for administrative services payable under the terms of the Administration Agreement, which are included in Other general and administrative expenses.
 From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and we will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on our behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. 
 In November 2021, the Board renewed the Administration Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until November 2022, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days’ written notice to the other party. 
 No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as our director receives any compensation from us for his or her services as a director. However, we reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion of the costs of compensation, benefits, and related administrative expenses of our officers who provide operational and administrative services to us pursuant to the Administration Agreement, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to us (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate). Such reimbursable amounts include the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and other professionals who provide operational and administrative services to us pursuant to the Administration Agreement, including individuals who provide “back office” or “middle office” financial, operational, legal and/or compliance services to us. We reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to such individuals based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs and in acting on behalf of us. We may also reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion of overhead expenses (including rent, office equipment and utilities) attributable thereto. Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings. 
 The Adviser does not assume any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in, and on the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, and is not responsible for any action of our Board in declining to follow the advice or recommendations of the Adviser. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, the Adviser (and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it) shall not be liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of ours (except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services). We shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide indemnification and the right to the advancement of expenses, to each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a member, manager, officer, employee, agent, controlling person of the Adviser or any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, or is or was a member of the Adviser’s Investment Review Committee, on the same general terms set forth in Article VIII of our certificate of incorporation. 
 United States federal and state securities laws may impose liability under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith. Nothing in the Investment Advisory Agreement will constitute a waiver or limitation of any rights that we may have under any applicable federal or state securities laws.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the Incentive Fee: 
 Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income 
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 
 

Percentage of pre-Incentive Fee net investment income allocated to income-related portion of Incentive Fee 
 Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation: 
 Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*): 
 Alternative 1 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2% 
 Hurdle rate (1) = 1.5% 
 Management Fee (2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income 
 (investment income – (Management Fee + other expenses)) = 1.425% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no Incentive Fee. 
 Alternative 2 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.375% 
 Hurdle rate (1) = 1.5% 
 Management Fee (2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income 
 (investment income – (Management Fee + other expenses)) = 1.8% 
 Incentive Fee = 100% × pre-Incentive Fee net investment income, subject to the “catch-up” (4) 
 = 100% × (1.8% – 1.5%) 
 = 0.3% 
 18


Alternative 3 
 Assumptions 
 Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5% 
 Hurdle rate (1) = 1.5% 
 Management Fee (2) = 0.375% 
 Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% 
 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income 
 (investment income – (Management Fee + other expenses)) = 2.925% 
 Incentive Fee = 17.5% × pre-Incentive Fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up” (4) 
 Incentive Fee = 100% × “catch-up” + (17.5% × (pre-Incentive Fee net investment income – 1.82%)) 
 Catch-up = 1.82% – 1.5% = 0.32% 
 Incentive Fee = (100% × 0.32%) + (17.5% × (2.925% – 1.82%)) 
 = 0.32% + (17.5% × 1.105%) 
 = 0.32% + 0.193% 
 = 0.513% 
  
(1) | Represents 6.0% annualized hurdle rate.
----+----------------------------------------


(2) | Represents 1.5% annualized Management Fee. For the purposes of these examples the Management Fee is assumed to be based on net assets, rather than gross assets.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Excludes organizational and offering expenses.
----+-----------------------------------------------


(4) | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-Incentive Fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.5% in any calendar quarter and is not applied once the Adviser has received 17.5% of investment income in a quarter. The “catch-up” portion of our pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is the portion that exceeds the 1.5% hurdle rate but is less than or equal to approximately 1.82% (that is, 1.5% divided by (1 – 0.175)) in any fiscal quarter.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(*) | The hypothetical amount of pre-Incentive Fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets.

The capital gains portion of the Incentive Fee would be: 
  
• | Year 1: None
--+-------------


• | Year 2:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = 15% multiplied by ($10 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation) = $1.2 million
 
• | Year 3:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($10 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $1.2 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $1.2 million less $1.2 million = $0.00
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($10 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $10 million Total Gain Amount )) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($0 Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $10 million Total Gain Amount)) = 15%
 
• | Year 4:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($12 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $1.2 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $1.8 million less $1.2 million = $0.6 million
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($12 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $12 million Total Gain Amount)) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($0 Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $12 million Total Gain Amount)) = 15%
 
• | Year 5:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($22 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $1.8 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $3.45 million less $1.8 million = $1.65 million
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($16 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $22 million Total Gain Amount)) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($6 million Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $22 million Total Gain Amount)) = 15.68%
 
• | Year 6:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $3.45 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.18 million less $3.45 million = $0.73 million
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($16 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $28 million Total Gain Amount)) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($12 million Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $28 million Total Gain Amount)) = 16.07%

• | Year 7:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative realized capital losses)) less $4.18 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.18 million less $4.18 million = $0.00
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($16 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $28 million Total Gain Amount)) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($12 million Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $28 million Total Gain Amount)) = 16.07%
 
• | Year 8:
--+--------

 Capital Gains Fee = (Weighted Percentage multiplied by ($36 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative realized capital losses)) less $4.18 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $5.57 million less $4.18 million = $1.39 million
Weighted Percentage = (15% multiplied by ($16 million Pre-IPO Gain Amount divided by $36 million Total Gain Amount)) plus (17.5% multiplied by ($20 million Post-IPO Gain Amount divided by $36 million Total Gain Amount)) = 16.39%
Payment of Our Expenses 
 The costs associated with the Investment Team and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing us investment advisory and management services are paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to:

• | calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee;
--+------------------------------------------


• | certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Adviser’s allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transfer agent and custodial fees;
--+-----------------------------------


• | costs of hedging;
--+------------------


• | commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------


• | Independent Director fees and expenses;
--+----------------------------------------


• | costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders’ meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our fidelity bond;
--+-------------------


• | directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 21


 
• | indemnification payments;
--+--------------------------


• | direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, from time to time, the Adviser pays amounts owed by us to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board. We subsequently reimburse the Adviser for those amounts paid on our behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms. We also reimburse the Adviser for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). 
 Duration and Termination 
 Unless earlier terminated as described below, both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect until November 2022, and each may be extended subject to required approvals. Each agreement will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and, in either case, if also approved by a majority of the directors of the Board who are not “interested persons” of us, the Adviser or any of our or its respective affiliates, as defined in the 1940 Act (known as Independent Directors). The Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser. Each agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty on 60 days’ written notice to the other party. The holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities may also terminate each agreement without penalty on 60 days’ written notice. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We are dependent upon management personnel of the Adviser, Sixth Street, and their affiliates for our future success.”
 Indemnification 
 The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement provide that the Adviser and its members, managers, officers, employees, agents, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it shall not be liable to us for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Adviser in connection with the performance of any of its duties or obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Administration Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser of ours (except to the extent specified in Section 36(b) of the 1940 Act concerning loss resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty (as the same is finally determined by judicial proceedings) with respect to the receipt of compensation for services). We will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, provide indemnification and the right to the advancement of expenses, to each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (including, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, because he or she is or was a member, manager, officer, employee, agent, controlling person or any other person or entity affiliated with the Adviser, including without limitation the Administrator, or is or was a member of the Adviser’s Investment Review Committee, on the same general terms set forth in our certificate of incorporation. Our obligation to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses is subject to the requirements of the 1940 Act and Investment Company Act Release No. 11330, which, among other things, preclude indemnification for any liability (whether or not there is an adjudication of liability or the matter has been settled) arising by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties, and require reasonable and fair means for determining whether indemnification will be made. 
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 
 Our Board, including our Independent Directors, and holders of a majority of our outstanding securities, approved our Investment Advisory Agreement in December 2011. Our Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement in November 2021. In its consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement at the time of approval and renewal, the Board focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: 

• | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by the Adviser;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our investment and financial performance on a standalone basis and against a comparative universe of peers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow, and whether the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to the Adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those income sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing those services under the Investment Advisory Agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the organizational and functional capabilities and financial condition of the Adviser and its respective affiliates; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally managed structure.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Board also takes into consideration the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Adviser on our behalf when determining whether to approve renewal of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. No one factor was given greater weight than any others, but rather the Board considered all factors collectively as a whole.
 Based on the information reviewed and the discussion thereof, the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided. 
 Regulation as a Business Development Company 
 We are regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. 
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
 As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after any borrowing or issuance. See “—Senior Securities” for more information. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and increases the risk of investing in us.” As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage was 205.4% and 204.5% respectively. 
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, and (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. 
 We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our status as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “—Regulated Investment Company Classification” for more information. 
 In addition, investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions. 
 23


We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital.” We may, however, elect to issue and sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that the sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders have approved our policy and practice of making these sales within the preceding 12 months. Pursuant to approval granted at a special meeting of stockholders held on May 26, 2021, we are currently permitted to sell or otherwise issue shares of our common stock at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, subject to the approval of our Board and certain other conditions. Such stockholder approval expires on May 26, 2022. We may in the future seek such approval again; however, there is no assurance such approval will be obtained. In this case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities. In addition, we may generally issue new common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 
 We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 Compliance with regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditure, earnings or competitive position.  
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure.” 
 Transactions with our Affiliates
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates, including our officers, directors, investment adviser, and principal underwriters, and certain of their affiliates, without the prior approval of the members of our Board who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC through an exemptive order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance). 
 On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate for us to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain “follow-on” investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On December 28, 2021, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. There can be no assurance when or if the SEC will grant a further order in response to our application. Until such time a new order is granted, we will continue to operate under the terms of our current exemptive order.
 We believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide “one-stop” financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors. 
 Further, in accordance with the exemptive order, we have undertaken that, in connection with any commitment to a co-investment or follow-on investment, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Independent Directors must make certain conclusions, including that: 
  
• | the terms of the proposed transaction (including the consideration to be paid) are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and our investment strategies and policies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the investment by our affiliate would not disadvantage us, and our participation is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of our affiliate; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our investment will not benefit any affiliate other than the affiliate participating in the investment, and as otherwise permitted by the order.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any assets other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

• | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by us) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfies any of the following:
--+--------------------------------


• | has an equity market capitalization of less than $250 million or does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, such that at least 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 A BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described under “Qualifying Assets” above. However, to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, the BDC will satisfy this test if one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, either controlling the issuer of the securities or any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does in fact provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 
Senior Securities 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC generally is not permitted to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock unless immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 150%.
 We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of shares senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% immediately after any borrowing or 
 25


issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or publicly-traded debt securities are outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratio at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. 
 The 1940 Act imposes limitations on a BDC’s issuance of preferred stock, which is considered a “senior security” and thus is subject to the 150% asset coverage requirement described above. 
 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage was 205.4% and 204.5% respectively.
 Code of Ethics 
 As required by the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, we and the Adviser have adopted codes of ethics which apply to, among others, our and our Adviser’s executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as our Adviser’s officers, directors and employees. The codes of ethics establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the codes may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the codes’ requirements. There have been no material changes to the codes or material waivers of the codes that apply to our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. 
Compliance Policies and Procedures 
 We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on certain publicly held companies and their insiders. Assuming certain requirements are met, many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
  
• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, subject to certain assumptions, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is required to be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 The NYSE Corporate Governance Rules 
 The NYSE has adopted corporate governance rules that listed companies must comply with. We believe we are in compliance with these rules.
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of our Adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Adviser and our Independent Directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 
 26


An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Adviser recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the Adviser’s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 The Adviser will vote all proxies based upon the guiding principle of seeking the maximization of the ultimate long-term economic value of our stockholders’ holdings, and ultimately all votes are cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the relevant advisory agreements or comparable documents, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. All proxy voting decisions will require a mandatory conflicts of interest review by our Chief Compliance Officer in accordance with these policies and procedures, which will include consideration of whether the Adviser or any investment professional or other person recommending how to vote the proxy has an interest in how the proxy is voted that may present a conflict of interest. It is the Adviser’s general policy to vote or give consent on all matters presented to security holders in any proxy, and these policies and procedures have been designed with that in mind. However, the Adviser reserves the right to abstain on any particular vote or otherwise withhold its vote or consent on any matter if, in the judgment of our Chief Compliance Officer or the relevant investment professional(s), the costs associated with voting such proxy outweigh the benefits to our stockholders or if the circumstances make such an abstention or withholding otherwise advisable and in the best interest of the relevant stockholder(s). 
 Privacy Principles 
 We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of nonpublic personal information relating to investors. The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 
 We generally will not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to stockholders who purchase common stock. We may collect nonpublic personal information regarding certain investors from sources such as subscription agreements, investor questionnaires and other forms; individual investors’ account histories; and correspondence between us and individual investors. We may share information that we collect regarding an investor with our affiliates and the employees of such affiliates for legitimate business purposes, for example, to service the investor’s accounts or provide the investor with information about other products and services offered by us or our affiliates that may be of interest to the investor. In addition, we may disclose information that we collect regarding investors to third parties who are not affiliated with us (i) as authorized by our investors in investor subscription agreements or our organizational documents; (ii) as required by law or in connection with regulatory or law enforcement inquiries; or, (iii) as otherwise permitted by law to the extent necessary to effect, administer or enforce investor transactions or our transactions. 
 Any party that receives nonpublic personal information relating to investors from us is permitted to use the information only for legitimate business purposes or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable law or regulation. In this regard, our officers, employees and agents and those of our affiliates, access to such information is restricted to those who need such access to provide services to us and our investors. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to seek to guard investor nonpublic personal information. 
 Reporting Obligations 
 We will furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports, as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 We make available on our website (www.sixthstreetspecialtylending.com) our proxy statements, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K that we file with the SEC. 
 The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains this information. 
 Regulated Investment Company Classification 
 As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  
 To maintain our status as a RIC, we must, among other things: 
  
• | maintain our election under the 1940 Act to be treated as a BDC;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities and other specified categories of investment income; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 27


 
• | maintain diversified holdings so that, subject to certain exceptions and cure periods, at the end of each quarter of our taxable year:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | at least 50% of the value of our total gross assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, the securities of other RICs and “other securities,” provided that such “other securities” shall not include any amount of any one issuer, if our holdings of such issuer are greater in value than 5% of our total assets or greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets may be invested in securities of any one issuer, the securities of any two or more issuers that are controlled by us and are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses (excluding U.S. government securities and securities of other RICs), or the securities of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To maintain our status as a RIC, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, as well as other taxable income, excluding any net capital gains reduced by deductible expenses) and 90% of our net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to stockholders. In addition, to avoid the imposition of a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
  
• | 98% of our net ordinary income, excluding certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized during a calendar year;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 98.2% of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 100% of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have previously incurred, and can be expected to incur in the future, such excise tax on a portion of our income and gains. While we intend to distribute income and capital gains to minimize exposure to the 4% excise tax, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, distribute amounts sufficient to avoid the imposition of the tax entirely. In that event, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We generally expect to distribute substantially all of our earnings on a quarterly basis, but will reinvest dividends on behalf of those investors that do not elect to receive their dividends in cash. See “—Dividend Policy” and “—Dividend Reinvestment Plan” for a description of our dividend policy and obligations. One or more of the considerations described below, however, could result in the deferral of dividend distributions until the end of the fiscal year: 
  
• | We may make investments that are subject to tax rules that require us to include amounts in our income before we receive cash corresponding to that income or that defer or limit our ability to claim the benefit of deductions or losses. For example, if we acquire securities issued with original issue discount, that original issue discount may be accrued in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In cases where our taxable income exceeds our available cash flow, we will need to fund distributions with the proceeds of sale of securities or with borrowed money, and may raise funds for this purpose opportunistically over the course of the year.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In certain circumstances (e.g., where we are required to recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income), we may have difficulty making distributions in the amounts necessary to satisfy the requirements for maintaining RIC status and for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Accordingly, we may have to sell investments at times we would not otherwise consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify as a RIC and thereby be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 
 If in any particular taxable year, we do not qualify as a RIC, all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to stockholders, and distributions will be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, and distributions would not be required. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two consecutive taxable years, to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain assets (that is, the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had sold the property at fair market value at the end of the taxable year) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years. 
 28


In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the conditions necessary to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.
