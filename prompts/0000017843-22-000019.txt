Item 1.  Business

(a)             General Development of Business:

Carpenter Technology Corporation, founded in 1889, is engaged in the manufacturing, fabrication and distribution of specialty metals. As used throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Carpenter", "Carpenter Technology", "Company", "Registrant", "Issuer", "we" and "our" refer to Carpenter Technology Corporation.

(b)             Financial Information About Segments:

We are organized in two reportable business segments: Specialty Alloys Operations ("SAO") and Performance Engineered Products ("PEP"). See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional segment reporting information. 

(c)              Narrative Description of Business:
 (1)               General:

We are a recognized leader in high-performance specialty alloy-based materials and process solutions for critical applications in the aerospace, defense, medical, transportation, energy, industrial and consumer end-use markets. We have evolved to become a pioneer in premium specialty alloys, including titanium, nickel, and cobalt, as well as alloys specifically engineered for additive manufacturing processes and soft magnetics applications. We have expanded our additive manufacturing capabilities to provide a complete "end-to-end" solution to accelerate materials innovation and streamline parts production. 
Reportable Segments

The SAO segment is comprised of the Company's major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas as well as South Carolina and Alabama. The combined assets of the SAO segment are managed in an integrated manner to optimize efficiency and profitability across the total system. 

The PEP segment is comprised of the Company's differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Additive business and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. Effective July 1, 2020, the Company's Carpenter Powder Products business was merged into the Carpenter Additive business. The Amega West business was also part of the PEP segment however, it was divested during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote flexibility and agility to quickly respond to market dynamics.

(2)                 Raw Materials:

Our business depends on continued receipt of critical raw materials for our day to day operations. These raw materials include nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, iron and scrap containing the named alloys. Some of the sources of these raw materials, many of which are international, could be subject to potential interruptions of supply as a result of political events, labor unrest or other reasons. These potential interruptions could cause material shortages and affect availability and price. We have arrangements with certain vendors to provide consigned materials at our manufacturing facilities available for our consumption as necessary. 

We have long-term relationships with major suppliers who provide availability of material at competitive prices. Purchase prices of certain raw materials have historically been volatile. We use pricing surcharges, indexing mechanisms, base price adjustments and raw material forward contracts to reduce the impact on our business of changing prices for the most significant of these materials. There can be delays between the time of the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefits of such mechanisms or actions that could have a short-term impact on our results and could affect the comparability of our results from period to period. 

(3)                 Patents and Licenses:

We own a number of United States and international patents and have granted licenses under some of them. In addition, certain products that we produce are covered by patents held or owned by other companies from whom licenses have been obtained. The duration of a patent issued in the United States is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing a patent application or issuance of the patent. The duration of a patent issued outside of the United States varies from country to country. Generally, patent licenses are structured to match the duration of the underlying patent. Although these patents and licenses are believed to be of value, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single such item or related group of such items.
(4)                Seasonality of Business:

Our sales are normally influenced by seasonal factors. Historically, our sales in the first two fiscal quarters (the respective three months ending September 30 and December 31) are typically the lowest, principally because of annual plant vacation and maintenance shutdowns by us, as well as by many of our customers. However, the timing of major changes in the general economy or the markets for certain products can alter this historical pattern, such as the widespread economic impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020.

The chart below summarizes the percent of net sales by quarter for the past three fiscal years:


Quarter Ended | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
September 30, | 21 | % | | 24 | % | 27 | %
December 31, | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 26 | %
March 31, | 28 | % | | 24 | % | 27 | %
June 30, | 28 | % | | 29 | % | 20 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(5)                 Customers:

On a consolidated basis, we are not dependent upon a single customer, or very few customers, such that the loss of any one or more particular customers would have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of total net sales for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. One customer, Howmet Aerospace Inc. (formerly Arconic Inc.), accounted for approximately 10 percent of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2020. For the year ended June 30, 2020, 90 percent of sales to Howmet Aerospace Inc. were reported by the SAO segment and 10 percent were reported by the PEP segment, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2022 or June 30, 2021. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. 
(6)                Backlog:

As of June 30, 2022, we had a sales backlog of orders excluding surcharge, believed to be firm, of approximately $1,539.3 million, the majority of which is expected to be shipped within fiscal year 2023. Our backlog of orders excluding surcharge as of June 30, 2021, was approximately $529.3 million. This growing backlog is a result of the strong demand growth in all of our key end-use markets as recovery continues to ramp from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
(7)                Competition:

We are leaders in specialty materials for critical applications with over 130 years of metallurgical and manufacturing expertise. Our business is highly competitive. We manufacture and supply materials to a variety of end-use market sectors and compete with various companies depending on the end-use market, product or geography. A significant portion of the products we produce are highly engineered materials for demanding applications. There are less than ten companies producing one or more similar products that we consider our major competitors for our high-value products used in demanding applications, particularly in our Aerospace and Defense and Energy end-use markets. These products are generally required to meet complex customer product specifications and often require the materials to be qualified prior to supplying the customer. Our experience, technical capabilities, product offerings and research and development efforts represent barriers to existing and potential competitors. 

For other products, there are several dozen smaller producing companies and converting companies that are also competitors, as well as several hundred independent distributors of products similar to those distributed by us. Additionally, numerous foreign companies produce various specialty metal products similar to those produced by us. Furthermore, a number of different products may, in certain instances, be substituted for our finished products. 
(8)                Research, Product and Process Development:

Our expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development were $20.4 million, $19.7 million and $28.0 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that our ability to be an innovator in special material development and manufacturing processes has been and will continue to be an important factor in the success of the Company. Our worldwide staff of expert metallurgists, research and development scientists, engineers and service professionals work closely with our customers to identify and provide innovative solutions to specific product requirements.

(9)         Environmental Regulations:

We are subject to various stringent federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Management evaluates the liability for future environmental remediation costs on a quarterly basis. We accrue amounts for environmental remediation costs representing management's best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs relating to environmental remediation. For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data". 

Our costs of maintaining and operating environmental control equipment were $14.8 million, $14.9 million and $15.4 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The capital expenditures for environmental control equipment were $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $0.1 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate spending approximately $2.8 million on domestic environmental capital projects over the next five fiscal years. This includes approximately $1.4 million in fiscal year 2023. Due to the possibility of future regulatory developments, the amount of future capital expenditures may vary from these estimates.

Governance: Our policy is to comply with the letter and spirit of all laws that govern our operations and to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics. We implemented general legal and ethical guidelines in our "Code of Conduct". The guidelines apply to all employees and majority-owned affiliates, including subsidiaries, both in the United States and other countries. 
As of June 30, 2022, our total workforce consisted of approximately 4,100 employees, which included 159 production employees in Washington, Pennsylvania, who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 31, 2022, and 401 employees in Latrobe, Pennsylvania who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 1, 2023. In July 2020, a union election was held involving 62 employees at our Franklin, Pennsylvania location and a majority of the employees voted for union representation. Negotiations with union representatives for an initial agreement are currently underway for this facility. We believe our relations with our employees are generally good.
