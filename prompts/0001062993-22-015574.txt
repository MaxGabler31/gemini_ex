Item 1. Business
 Dakota Gold Corp. (formerly JR Resources Corp., "Dakota Gold" or "the Company") is a Nevada corporation that was formed in British Columbia, Canada in 2017 and continued to Nevada in 2020. The Company is engaged in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral properties within the Homestake Gold District (the "District") of the Black Hills of South Dakota. To date, while no development or mining activities have commenced, the Company's strategy is to move projects from exploration to development and finally into production as results of exploration may dictate. The Company's management and technical teams have extensive mining and exploration experience, much of it in the Homestake District, and the Company intends to leverage its experience together with its business presence in South Dakota to create value for the Company's stakeholders. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 106 Glendale Drive, Suite A, Lead, South Dakota, 57754, and its telephone number is (605) 717-2540.

The Company maintains 100% ownership of 11 mineral properties in the district comprised of 1,905 unpatented claims and a combination of surface leases and/or ownership covering a total of approximately 43,971 acres located in the Homestake Mining District of South Dakota, including the Blind Gold, City Creek, Tinton, West Corridor, Ragged Top, Poorman Anticline, Maitland, South Lead / Whistler Gulch, the Barrick Option, Richmond Hill and Homestake Paleoplacer Properties, all of which are located in the heart of the Homestake District. Our goal is to obtain sufficient capital to advance our current property portfolio, to fund acquisition of additional prospective mineral properties, and for the general working capital needs of the Company.

 U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resources will ever be converted into reserves that meet the requirements of S-K 1300. We have not established that any of our properties contain proven or probable reserves under S-K 1300.
 Competitors
 The mining industry is highly competitive. We will be competing with numerous companies, many with greater financial resources available to them. We therefore will be at a significant disadvantage in the course of acquiring mining properties and obtaining materials, supplies, labor, and equipment. Additionally, there are established and well-financed companies active in the mining industry that will have an advantage over us if they are competing for the same properties.
Government Approvals
 The exploration, drilling and mining industries operate in a legal environment that requires permits to conduct virtually all activities. Thus, permits are required by local, state and federal government agencies. Local authorities, usually counties, also have control over mining activity. The various permits address issues such as prospecting, development, production, labor standards, taxes, occupational health and safety, toxic substances, air quality, water use, water discharge, water quality, noise, dust, wildlife impacts, as well as other environmental and socioeconomic issues.
 Prior to receiving the necessary permits to explore or mine, the operator must comply with all regulatory requirements imposed by all governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project area. Very often, in order to obtain the requisite permits, the operator must have its land reclamation, restoration or replacement plans pre-approved. Specifically, the operator must present its plan as to how it intends to restore or remediate the affected area. Often all or any of these requirements can cause delays or involve costly studies or alterations of the proposed activity or time frame of operations, in order to mitigate impacts. All these factors make it more difficult and costly to operate and have a negative and sometimes fatal impact on the viability of the exploration or mining operation. Finally, it is possible that future changes in these laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our business, causing those activities to be economically re-evaluated at that time.
 Effect of Existing or Probable Government and Environmental Regulations
 Mineral exploration, including mining operations are subject to governmental regulation. Our operations may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation such as restrictions on production, price controls, tax increases, expropriation of property, environmental and pollution controls or changes in conditions under which minerals may be marketed. An excess supply of certain minerals may exist from time to time due to lack of markets, restrictions on exports, and numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include market fluctuations and government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, allowable production and importing and exporting minerals. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately determined, and we are not aware of any probable government regulations that would impact the Company. This section is intended as a brief overview of the laws and regulations described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter.
 Overview. Like all other mining companies doing business in the United States, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local statutes, rules and regulations designed to protect the quality of the air and water, and threatened or endangered species, in the vicinity of its operations. These include "permitting" or pre-operating approval requirements designed to ensure the environmental integrity of a proposed mining facility, operating requirements designed to mitigate the effects of discharges into the environment during exploration, any mining operations, and reclamation or post-operation requirements designed to remediate the lands affected by a mining facility once any commercial mining operations have ceased.
 Federal legislation in the United States and implementing regulations adopted and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS"), the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies-in particular, legislation such as the federal Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Forest Management Act, the Wilderness Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act-have a direct bearing on domestic mining operations. These federal initiatives are often administered and enforced through state agencies operating under parallel state statutes and regulations.
 The Clean Water Act. The federal Clean Water Act is the principal federal environmental protection law regulating mining operations in the United States as it pertains to water quality.
 
At the state level, water quality is regulated by the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the State of South Dakota. If our exploration or any future development activities might affect a ground water aquifer, it will have to apply for a Ground Water Discharge Permit from the Ground Water Quality Bureau in compliance with the Groundwater Regulations. If exploration affects surface water, then compliance with the Surface Water Regulations is required.
 The Clean Air Act. The federal Clean Air Act establishes ambient air quality standards, limits the discharges of new sources and hazardous air pollutants and establishes a federal air quality permitting program for such discharges. Hazardous materials are defined in the federal Clean Air Act and enabling regulations adopted under the federal Clean Air Act include various metals. The federal Clean Air Act also imposes limitations on the level of particulate matter generated from mining operations.
 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires all governmental agencies to consider the impact on the human environment of major federal actions as therein defined.
 Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. In order to facilitate the conservation of imperiled species, the ESA establishes an interagency consultation process. When a federal agency proposes an action that "may affect" a listed species, it must consult with the USFWS and must prepare a "biological assessment" of the effects of a major construction activity if the USFWS advises that a threatened species may be present in the area of the activity.
 National Forest Management Act. The National Forest Management Act, as implemented through title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, provides a planning framework for lands and resource management of the National Forests. The planning framework seeks to manage the National Forest System resources in a combination that best serves the public interest without impairment of the productivity of the land, consistent with the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960.
 Wilderness Act. The Wilderness Act of 1964 created a National Wilderness Preservation System composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as "wilderness areas" to be preserved for future use and enjoyment.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA imposes clean-up and reclamation responsibilities with respect to discharges into the environment and establishes significant criminal and civil penalties against those persons who are responsible for such discharges.
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA was designed and implemented to regulate the disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. It restricts solid waste disposal practices and the management, reuse or recovery of solid wastes and imposes substantial additional requirements on the subcategory of solid wastes that are determined to be hazardous. Like the Clean Water Act, RCRA provides for citizens' suits to enforce the provisions of the law.
 National Historic Preservation Act. The National Historic Preservation Act was designed and implemented to protect historic and cultural properties. Compliance with the Act is necessary where federal properties or federal actions are undertaken, such as mineral exploration on federal land, which may impact historic or traditional cultural properties, including native or Indian cultural sites.
 In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, we incurred minimal costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations in relation to our operating activities, although costs may increase in future periods.
 Employees
 As of March 31, 2022, we had 24 employees. We had 4 employees as of March 31, 2021.
