Corporate History and Organizational Structure
 
History and Development of the Company
 
Our legal and commercial name is SPI Energy Co., Ltd. Our principal executive office is located at 4677 Old Ironsides Drive, Suite 190 Santa Clara, CA 95054. Our telephone number at this address is +1 408-919-8000. Our registered office is situated at 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church Street, PO Box 10240, George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1002, Cayman Islands.
 
The Company was incorporated by SPI as a company limited by shares in the Cayman Islands on May 4, 2015. On January 4, 2016, we completed the redomiciliation of SPI to the Cayman Islands, whereby SPI merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the holders of SPI common stock received ADS representing ordinary shares of the Company. As a result, the former shareholders of SPI became the beneficial owners of the capital stock of the Company, and the Company, together with our subsidiaries, now own and continue to conduct SPI’s business in substantially the same manner as was conducted by SPI and its subsidiaries. The Company is also managed by substantially the same board of directors and executive officers that managed SPI previously.
 
Between January 19, 2016 and September 18, 2017, our ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol of “SPI”. The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank for the ADS facility, terminated our ADS facility on September 18, 2017. Following such termination, we listed our ordinary shares, par value US$0.0001 per share, for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market in substitution for our ADSs. On September 19, 2017, our ordinary shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol of “SPI”.
 
In September 2017, we entered into a framework share purchase agreement to acquire 100% equity interests of three Greek companies, namely THERMI SUN S.A, HELIOHRISI S.A., and HELIOSTIXIO S.A., from THERMI TANEO Venture Capital Fund (“TTVCF”), for a total consideration of EUR 16.8 million, subject to certain adjustments. These three companies own a total of four PV plants with 7.4MWp PV installations in northern Greece. The closing of the transaction took place in three separate stages (one for each company under acquisition). The acquisition of HELIOSTIXIO S.A. was closed in December 2017. The Company completed the second-stage acquisition of 100% of the equity interest of HELIOHRISI S.A., which owns 1.988 MW of photovoltaic projects in Greece on March 20 2019. The last of three acquisitions of 100% of the equity interest of THERMI SUN S.A., which owns 4.4 Megawatts (“MW”) of photovoltaic (“PV”) projects in Greece, was closed November 1, 2019. With 7.4MWp PV installations added to SPI Energy’s existing PV portfolio in Greece, the Company becomes one of the significant PV owners in Greece.

By the year end of December 31, 2018, our wholly owned subsidiary, SPI Solar Inc., sold eight solar projects in the U.S. (9.653 MW) to third parties.
 
On January 17, 2019, we entered into share purchase agreements with certain existing shareholders (including certain key management personnel of the Company) and other investors (collectively, the “Purchasers”), pursuant to which the Purchasers agreed to purchase an aggregate of 6,600,000 ordinary shares of the Company at a price of US$1.16 per Share, for a total consideration of approximately $7.7 million. The transaction was closed on April 12, 2019. Those shares were being offered and sold to private investors, on a private placement basis in reliance on Regulation S. Those shares have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. Net proceeds from the sale of those shares are intended to be used for expansion of our global PV project activities and general corporate purposes.
 
On July 23, 2019, the Company entered into a framework agreement to acquire up to eight solar PV projects, totaling 21MW in the State of Oregon (the “Oregon Portfolio”). On August 26, 2019, the Company completed the closing of Manchester and Waterford solar projects with a total of approximately 5.4MW. On September 10, 2019, the Company completed the closing on the Belvedere project with approximately 3.56MW of clean energy for the local community. On September 24, 2019, the Company completed the closing of the Dover and Clayfield solar projects with a total of approximately 5.45MW. On April 22, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the Cork project with a total of approximately 1.5MW. The Company has now closed 6 of the 8 projects within the Oregon Portfolio. The Company does not intend to purchase the remaining 2 projects, Carlow Solar LLC and Cavan Solar LLC and the right entitled SPI to purchase these remaining 2 projects has expired already.
 
On September 26, 2019, the Company completed the closing of the sale of Sun Roof II and Sun Roof V to Theia Investments (Italy) S.r.l. (“Theia”), a company established by an infrastructure fund managed by Stafford Capital Partners (“Stafford”), a leading private markets investment and advisory group. Sun Roof II, comprised of three rooftop solar projects totaling 1.83 MW located in Sassari, Italy, and Sun Roof V, a 1 MW rooftop solar project located in Cisterna di Latina, Italy, have been in operation since 2012. Theia paid approximately EUR4.3 million to complete the transaction. On March 9, 2020, the Company completed the closing of the sale of its Sun Roof I assets, a 479 kWp rooftop solar project located in Aprilia, Italy, that has been in operation since 2012. Proceeds from the sale were approximately EUR 1.1 million before transaction fees, providing additional capital for the development of solar assets in the US and Greece. After the sale of Sun Roof II, Sun Roof V and Sun Roof I, the Company currently owns only 1 PV asset with a capacity of 0.993 MW in Italy. 
 
On April 12, 2021, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary SPI Solar, Inc., executed a definitive agreement to acquire the MA Lovers Lane 6.5 megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) and 5.45 megawatt hour (MWh) energy storage project in Massachusetts from a third-party developer. The project will sell power through Massachusetts' SMART program and will provide community solar subscriptions to national grid customers. The project is expected to come online in 2022.
 
In December 2021, SPI Solar Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired the existing lease for the original 140,000 square feet Sunergy PV solar plant in Sacramento, California. Sunergy filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2021. Now with this facility, we can further support our growth and the expanding green economy with a California-based solar module manufacturing facility that enables us to deliver Made-in-USA products. The company started serving the U.S. market in Q1 2022, while agreements have been signed to upgrade the facility with new technology and equipment, ramping to full solar module production capacity of 1.1 gigawatt (GW) in the second half of 2022.
 
On January 24, 2022, the Company announced the opening of its first RideZoomers electric scooter retail store and service center in Fremont, California. RideZoomers Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition to offering RideZoomer electric scooters, the Fremont store will include a Solar4America showroom displaying the latest available branded on- and off-grid solar, battery, EV charger, and home energy solutions. Established in Seattle in 2019 as a scooter-sharing startup, RideZoomers pivoted to a direct-to-consumer and hardware business model in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. SPI Energy acquired the assets of RideZoomers in July 2021. The Fremont City store is located at 6066 Stevenson Boulevard., Fremont, California, 94538.
 
On February 7, 2022, SPI Solar Inc. rents approximately 473 acres across three parcels for the development of a utility scale solar project in Maryland.

Our Investment in Phoenix
 
On November 12, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Phoenix Cars LLC and Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC (together, “Phoenix”), an electric drivetrain manufacturer for medium-duty commercial vehicles and final stage manufacturer that integrates its drivetrains into these vehicles.
Our Investment in Residential Roofing and Solar Installations Business
 
Following the January 6, 2021 purchase of all work-in-progress consumer contracts of Petersen-Dean Inc. (“PDI”), for $875,000, on February 25, 2021 Solarjuice American Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“SJ US”), closed the acquisition of substantially all operating assets of PDI, including certain construction contracts with work-in-progress billings, fixed assets, intellectual property and other assets, for total cash consideration of $6,850,000 plus the assumption of $11,000,000 of the outstanding balance under an account receivables financing arrangement of a previous lender of PDI, net off by accounts receivables pledged for the liability with net balance of PDI of $11,764,085. SJ US does not assume any other PDI obligations, except to cure existing leases or warranties.
 
Founded in 1984, Petersen-Dean, Inc. specializes in residential roofing and solar system installations, frequently in cooperation with some of the nation’s largest builders and developers. With more than a million installations, the Pleasanton, CA-based company employs hundreds of installers and operates in five states: California, Florida, Nevada, Colorado, and Texas.
 
Since early 2020, PDI started to face the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which placed inexorable pressure on the business. As a result of the various shelter-in-place orders issued by local governments in response to the pandemic, PDI and its workforce were unable to operate at full capacity, as jobs were closed down or work has been halted at sites throughout the United States. This disruption caused a significant slowdown in collections, reductions in revenue, and cash-collection delays. As a result, PDI and 15 of its affiliates filed petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on June 11, 2020.

Solar Juice Australia, as a wholesale supplier, has developed key partners which have supported the growth of its brands throughout Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia (“SEA”) Countries. Solar Juice Australia aligns itself with the most popular brands SMA, Fronius, Sungrow, Solax, Solis, Tesla Powerwall, REC, Longi, Risen and Trina, which have the same values as Solar Juice Australia, namely service and support, quality and value for money. Solar Juice Australia’s products are backed by warranties held in Australia, experience and knowledge which set it apart from the competition, and commitment to serving the customer’ needs.
 
COVID-19 has caused unprecedented quarantine measures implemented by Australian Government resulting in significant impacts on people’s livelihood and businesses such as lockdown of communities and shutdown of businesses to reduce the spread of the virus. The Australian Government’s restrictions have significant impacts on Australian Solar industry as well. Solar Juice’s overseas supplies and shipments have been unreliable and unstable during 2021. Solar Juice’s revenue was affected initially by local lockdowns in Q3. The management of Solar Juice Australia’s has made detailed business continuity and resilience plan, predicted market changes and adjusted purchase and sales strategies accordingly. The whole team has put in extra time and effort to help the company went through the toughest period without impacts in revenue and profit. In fact Solar Juice has achieved AUD 165.3 million revenue, AUD 15.3 million gross profit and AUD 4.4 million net profit in 2021, which increased 0.5%, 15% and 224.9% respectively from 2020. Solar Juice Australia’s trade receivable balance increased 29.9%, inventory increased 35.0%, trade payable balance increased 61.2% from the previous year. As a result, the net assets of Solar Juice Australia increased significantly by 29.6% to AUD 19.6 million.
 
We expect Solar Juice Australia to benefit from these improvements in long term and keep its leadership in premium PV market in Australia. In the meantime, Solar Juice Australia’s traditional strengths such as outstanding customer services, technical support, and warranty service will keep differentiating it from competitors.
 
Solar Juice Australia currently accounts for 76.7% of our revenues and 15.5% of our total assets.
 
Our EPC Business
 
We are a global provider of photovoltaic (“PV”) solutions for business, residential, government and utility customers and investors. The Company develops solar PV projects that are either sold to third party operators or owned and operated by the Company for selling of electricity to the grid in multiple countries in Asia, North America and Europe. The Company has its operating headquarter in Santa Clara, California and maintains global operations in Asia, Europe, and North America. We are expanding our global project development business by ramping up our portfolio of global solar projects, including projects that we plan to hold in the long term and derive electricity generation revenue from our independent power producer model, or IPP model, and projects that we plan to sell in the future when we are presented with attractive opportunities under our build-and-transfer model, or BT model. We grow our project portfolio primarily through acquisitions and act as a secondary developer for the projects which are under construction or in pipeline upon acquisition. Solar projects in our current portfolio include projects at all stages of development, including projects in operation, projects under construction and projects in pipeline. See “Item 1 Business —Our Global Project Development Business—Our Solar Project Portfolio.”
 
For our EPC service business, the scope of our work encompasses engineering design, procurement of technical components from PV module and panel manufacturers and contracting of construction and installation, which reaches both upstream and downstream along the spectrum of the solar business value chain. Our rigorous design and supply chain management as well as construction quality control enable us to design, build and deliver world-class solar system configurations with components that can work optimally together.
 
Engineering Design
 
As a critical first step in the EPC process, engineering design involves the planning of the entire solar project, from feasibility studies of the land and irradiation levels to efficient arrangement of mounting, modules and connection systems. Our technical team takes responsibility over initial solar project engineering with support from third-party contractors. The engineering design process includes the site layout and the electrical design, as well as assessment of a variety of factors in order to choose appropriate technologies and equipment for the project, particularly modules and inverters. Throughout the engineering design phase, we aim to reduce the risks, control the costs and improve the performance of our EPC projects.

Procurement and Construction
 
In order to focus on our core downstream development and EPC service businesses, we no longer manufacture PV modules or produce other equipment such as controllers, inverters and balance of system components. Rather, we procure them from third-party manufacturers and install them in our PV systems as part of our EPC business.
 
We procure PV modules and other key equipment for project construction from independent suppliers and contract work to third-party EPC contractors in areas such as logistics, installation, construction and supervision. We believe this allows us to focus our resources on higher value-added tasks. We maintain an updated list of qualified and reliable global suppliers and local third-party contractors in the areas where we operate with a proven track record and with which we have established relationships.
 
We choose our suppliers and third-party EPC contractors through a competitive bidding process. The relevant departments of our headquarters organize and collect bids, communicate with bidders and coordinate with our regional development teams to meet local technical and legal requirements. This helps ensure that we have a strong, reliable and experienced supplier and construction team working with us on each of our EPC project.
 
Procurement of PV Modules and Other Equipment
 
We apply stringent quality assurance protocols to select components with a long useful life that are compatible with a variety of parameters of the project, including local topography and local solar irradiation.
 
PV modules, the primary equipment of our solar projects, typically contribute to a substantial portion of the overall system costs.
 
We consider the following factors when we procure project equipment: technical specifications (such as size, type and power output), bid prices, warranty and insurance programs, spectral response, performance in low light, nominal power tolerance levels, degradation rate, technical support and reputation of suppliers. We typically require 10-year warranties for defects in materials or workmanship and 25-year warranty for module capacity under normal testing conditions (2-3% of capacity for the first year with a 0.5- 0.8% linear degradation in capacity every year thereafter).
 
We are generally required to pay 100% of the purchase price within a period ranging from three months to six months after receipt, inspection and acceptance of the PV modules. We typically pay manufacturers deposits that represent 10% to 50% of the total purchase price.
 
Construction Contracting
 
When acting as a general contractor, we generally outsource the construction of our PV power plants to third-party construction companies and closely monitor their execution of our designs. Most of these companies are specialized EPC construction subcontractors. Our construction oversight teams conduct constructability reviews, provide construction support, contract administration and document control services, construction inspection, engineering support, instrumentation installation and monitoring, and on-site construction supervision and monitoring.
 
We utilize a number of metrics to manage and monitor the performance of our third-party contractors in terms of both quality and delivery time and to ensure compliance with applicable safety and other requirements. For instance, we may delegate qualified representatives to review, supervise, organize and provide comments on the third-party contractor’s design, construction plan, construction guidelines, materials and documentations. We also conduct periodic inspections to examine project implementation and quality against our project planning and quality standards and prepare periodic reports for review and approval by our relevant departments. If we identify any quality or progress issues that are attributable to the work of our third-party contractors, we will follow- up with them and monitor their rectification work.
 
Those third-party contractors are responsible for the quality of the project and must maintain relevant insurance designating us as the beneficiary. They must ensure the project complies with all local safety, labor and environmental laws and regulations. We examine and keep records of the production-related safety documentation and insurance policies of our third-party contractors. All production-related tools and equipment used by our third-party contractors must be compliant with and certified by applicable regulatory standards. The contractors submit detailed quality assurance procedures and regularly updates us on the progress, quality and safety of the project. Our third-party contractors utilize a variety of measures to protect the project location, including the transmission line, built facilities and infrastructure, from damage during the construction process.

-

 

We are generally entitled to damages if our third-party contractors fail to meet the prescribed requirements and deadlines under our contracts. We usually negotiate to pay our third-party contractors the remaining 5% or 10% of the contract price after the expiration of the quality warranty period, which generally ranges from one to two years. If we pay the full contract price upon completion of a project, we require the contractor to provide a performance guarantee in respect of the warranty obligations for such project.
 
Commissioning and Warranties
 
We assess and evaluate our solar projects before completion. Upon completion of construction, we conduct commissioning tests prior to grid connection. The tests include a detailed visual inspection of all significant aspects of the plant, an open circuit voltage test and a short circuit current test, and then a direct-current test after connecting to the grid. We focus commissioning tests on the quality of the construction and major equipment. These tests are conducted in order to ensure that the plant is structurally and electrically safe, and is sufficiently robust to operate as designed for the specified project lifetime.
 
After grid connection, we also conduct commissioning tests on electricity generation performance. As grid connection requires approval from power companies, post-grid connection commissioning tests are also conducted by local quality supervisors or third-parties approved by the power companies. In addition to the warranties provided by the manufacturers of modules and balance- of-system components, EPC contractors also typically provide a limited warranty against defects in workmanship, engineering design, and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years following the energizing of a section of a solar power plant or upon substantial completion of the entire solar power plant. In resolving claims under the workmanship, design and installation warranties, the new owner has the option of remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair, refurbishment, or replacement.
 
Our Global Project Development Business
 
We develop and sell or own and operate solar projects which sell electricity to the grid in multiple countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Greece, Japan and Italy. We are expanding our global project development business by ramping up our portfolio of global solar projects, including projects that we plan to hold in the long term for electricity generation revenue under our IPP model, as well as projects which we plan to sell in the future when we are presented with attractive opportunities under our BT model. We grow our project portfolio primarily through acquisitions and our project acquisition strategy is based on rigorous market research and due diligence on the target project’s capacity, local energy demands, applicable tariff regime, supporting infrastructure, local government support and topography for construction in the case of projects under construction and projects in pipeline. We also consider available financing options, internal rate of return, key technical components, terms of the grid connection agreements and power purchase agreements, or PPAs, as well as guarantees on performance for projects in all development stages. We act as secondary developer for the projects under construction or in pipeline when they are acquired. We either hold these projects in the long term for electricity generation revenue or sell them when presented with attractive opportunities.
 
We had an aggregate 252.39 MW of PV projects and 5.45 MWh energy storage project in the U.S., the U.K., Greece, Japan and Italy as of March 30, 2022.
 
Most of our solar projects are subject to the FIT or PPA policies of the countries or regions where they operate. FIT refers to the national and local subsidies to solar power generation supported by the government. PPA refers to power purchase agreement with electricity company. For the FIT terms of our projects, please refer to “—Our Solar Project Portfolio.”

As of December 31, 2021, we had capital commitments for solar projects of approximately $2.0 million. As total capital expenditures may be affected by various factors including, among others, increases in cost of key equipment and materials, failure to obtain sufficient financing, unexpected engineering or environmental issues as well as changes in regulatory requirements, actual total capital expenditures may deviate significantly from such estimates. We expect to finance construction of these projects using cash from our operations and private placements, bank borrowings, financial leases as well as other third-party financing options.

Acquisition of Solar Projects
 
Our board of directors has formulated a uniform standard for assessing target assets with respect to the acquisition of solar projects, and such standard may be adjusted based on our Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations from time to time. See “Item 5. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Operating Results—Recent Acquisition Activities” on the projects we have acquired or expect to acquire. Our board of directors considers the following criteria when assessing potential acquisitions, among others:

· | the internal rate of return of the project prior to leverage, taking into consideration applicable FIT or PPA rate, and other applicable government incentives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ratio of debt-service coverage;
--+------------------------------------


· | the solar irradiation hours of the project, after discounting for performance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the use of financeable and reliable brands for and technical specifications of the key components, including modules, invertors, mounting systems, racks/tracking systems, and EPC integration services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | any performance guarantees required, as well as any compensation for failing to perform;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | clear and trustworthy opinions from third-party professionals after detailed technical, financial, tax and legal due diligence; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reasonable payment terms matching relevant milestones.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

Market Due Diligence
 
We aim to select solar projects located at sites with long solar irradiation hours, high energy demand, good supporting infrastructure, favorable tariff regimes, local government support and appropriate topography for construction. We systematically analyze land cost, solar irradiation, grid connection capacity, land and property status, government support, availability of project financing and any other project information that would impact the overall economic return of the project. We target projects that we believe to have appropriate balance of financial returns, costs and risks.
Permit Development Process
 
The permit development process is the process of obtaining all required permits, certifications and approvals from relevant government authorities for solar project development. As of December 31, 2021, most of our solar projects in operation had been undertaken by us as a secondary developer.
 
We acquire solar projects under development by third parties which have secured land use rights, development permits, or even begun construction. We typically learn about potential projects suitable for secondary development from our business partners, national or local governments, industry publications, overseas engineering exhibitions or overseas business liaison organizations. Our criteria for sourcing solar projects include land cost, solar irradiation, availability of FIT benefits or other government incentives, grid connection capacity, local financing opportunities and other project information. The selection process involves detailed due diligence into those third parties’ relevant company documentation, financial projections and the legal status of permits already secured by the project.
 
After an acquisition, we continue to develop the project through grid connection as our own. We pursue secondary permit development in markets with relatively liquid markets for energy permits transfer, thus allowing a smooth transfer of pre-operational solar assets from third-party developers to us. Under certain circumstances, we negotiate site acquisition, preliminary permits, grid connection agreements and PPAs for projects under our secondary development model depending on the development stage when we acquire them.

Permit Development Steps
 
The following sets forth each step of our permit development:
 

· | Evaluating project sites and location—The critical factors for evaluating the site of a solar project include its solar irradiation, its proximity to a grid connection point, zoning regulations and its general geographic and topographic features. If a project site is suitable for development or acquisition, our regional development team submits a site assessment report on the land and other related information to our management for evaluation and approval.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Due diligence—Our in-house technical and EPC team, along with third-party experts we contract as needed, examine project items such as engineering and design specifications, technical risks and solar irradiation and environmental analyses. We pay special attentions to potential delays and cost overruns, grid capacity and additional costs which may not be captured in the technical design. We also ensure that a project has clean legal titles to the permits and other permissions it has secured. In all cases, we ensure that local regulations allow us to properly carry out our business intentions for a project, whether by allowing us to hold the project under our IPP model or transfer it under our BT model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Market considerations—We target projects which have appropriate balance of financial returns, costs and risks. Important factors include, the costs of maintenance, local taxes and fees, and the availability of applicable FIT, local credit or other refinancing options. Our financial teams conduct financial forecasts based on information about the financial prospects of the solar project and the local energy market to make a profitability estimate and adjust our capital plan accordingly.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Permitting—Permit and licensing requirements vary depending on the jurisdiction of the solar project, but the key permits, licenses and agreements typically required for solar projects include land acquisition or lease contracts, environmental impact assessments, building or rezoning permits, planning consents, grid connection contracts and PPAs. We work closely with relevant government and private stakeholders to secure all necessary permits to develop a project, including local or regional planning authorities, electric utilities, local communities, environmental agencies, as well as health and safety agencies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Project Financing
 
A solar project sponsor typically sets up a project company as a special purpose vehicle to own a particular solar project and arrange for project financing. We typically enter into contracts and other agreements under the name of the project company, which facilitates project financing by isolating the project and its assets, and any potential securitization requirements, from our broader global business.
 
The construction cost of a project is mainly funded by our working capital, and to a lesser extent, funded through bank borrowings in the year ended December 31, 2021. We seek to negotiate favorable credit terms with our equipment suppliers and EPC contractors when possible, such that payment is not due until several months after construction and grid connection are complete. Our working capital dedicated towards a particular project would be generally available to us for other purposes if needed, and would not be considered restricted cash isolated at that project. We also have given guarantees to the lenders on certain project financings. However, none of our cash and cash equivalents have been collateralized to guarantee such project financings.
 
We generally seek to arrange debt financing for our solar projects from local banks and financial leasing companies in countries that are more open and receptive to renewable energy investments.
 
Engineering, Procurement and Construction
 
Given the multi-jurisdiction coverage of our project portfolio, we choose to utilize our EPC capabilities or contract third party EPC contractors to service our own projects, based on our cost analysis taking into consideration of locations, topographical conditions as well as the quality and competition of local EPC service providers.

Our Operation and Maintenance Business
 
We operate and maintain solar projects connected to the grid, especially those we have provided EPC services to. We may choose to contract third party O&M contractors to service our own projects, based on our cost analysis taking into consideration of locations, topographical conditions as well as the quality and competition of local EPC service providers. We regularly maintain solar projects for our customers to ensure that these projects operate in good condition and comply with the recommendations issued by the grid company in order to remain connected.
 
By operating the projects effectively and efficiently, we reduce down time and increase electricity output. A project’s major lifecycle costs mainly consist of maintenance fee and depreciation of modules, inverters and transformers. We monitor electricity production and any incidents or abnormalities which may impede normal operation. We adjust production levels based on the available capacity of the grid.
 
Our Electric Vehicle (EV) Business
 
On November 12, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Phoenix Cars LLC and Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC (together, “Phoenix”).
 
Phoenix, doing business as “Phoenix Motorcars” through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Phoenix Cars LLC, Phoenix Motorcars Leasing LLC, and EdisonFuture Motor, Inc., currently designs, assembles, and integrates electric drive systems and light and medium duty electric vehicles (“EVs”) and markets and sells electric vehicle chargers for the commercial and residential markets. Phoenix operates two primary brands, “Phoenix Motorcars” focused on commercial products including medium duty vehicles, chargers and electric forklifts, and “EdisonFuture” which intends to offer light-duty vehicles. Over the years, we have served over 45 fleet customers with a variety of needs, providing customized products to complete essential business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we have delivered a total of 104 EVs, consisting of 91 shuttle buses and 13 work and delivery trucks, representing what we believe is the largest number of Class 4 cutaway medium duty shuttle bus deployments in the U.S. and also the most electric vehicle deployed on the Ford E-Series chassis. To date, we estimate that our products have accumulated more than three million driven electric miles. With the launch of our third-generation e-drive system in the second quarter of 2021, we had a backlog of 63 units as of December 31, 2021, consisting of orders for 37 vehicles and 26 electric drive systems, representing approximately $11.1 million in revenue. 
 
Our EV buses and trucks are available in a range of configurations, including shuttle buses, Type A school buses, utility trucks, service trucks, flatbed trucks, walk-in vans, and cargo trucks. Our delivery customers include major airports, airport shuttle operators, hotel chains, seaports, universities, municipalities, and large corporations.
 
In March 2021, we began delivering our third generation EVs, featuring our new, Romeo Power, Inc. modular battery packs, giving customers choices among 31KwH, 63KwH, 94KwH, 125KwH, and 156KwH batteries. Our ZEUS 300 EVs are built on the Ford F-450 chassis, with Romeo Power battery and Dana TM4 Sumo™ MD motors, and BTC Power battery chargers.
 
We believe that our EVs offer owners and fleet operators significant benefits, including:
 

· | Lower Ownership Cost. Electric vehicles cost less in total to own, operate, and maintain than diesel, gasoline and natural gas combustion-powered vehicles, even though the initial purchase price (after subsidies) is somewhat higher.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Less Maintenance, Lower Operating Cost, Greater Safety. Because electric motors have few moving parts and do not need liquid fuels or lubricants, they generally require less maintenance, are less expensive to operate, and avoid exposure to or spills or need to dispose of hazardous hydrocarbon fluids.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zero Vehicle Emissions. EVs enable customers to satisfy government mandates limiting vehicular emissions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Positive User Recognition. Our customers’ use of EVs may improve their public images, thereby conferring a competitive advantage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improved Driver and Passenger Comfort. Electric vehicles run more quietly than combustion-powered vehicles, enhancing operator and passenger comfort.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We assist customers with all aspects of fleet electrification, including recommending battery power levels needed for the customer’s applications; advising regarding necessary infrastructure, such as types of external chargers required and their locations, and whether the customer’s facilities have sufficient power for charging; and assistance with the customer’s contractors that install infrastructure.
 
We sell our vehicles to fleet customers directly; retail sales of vehicles carrying Forest River, Inc. bodies, (e.g., Starcraft bus bodies and Rockford truck bodies) are made through Creative Bus Sales, one of the largest distributors of buses in the United States.
 
On January 27, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an initial public offering of Phoenix Motor Inc., the Phoenix holding company. Our subsidiary, EdisonFuture, will own approximately 75% to 80% of Phoenix Motor Inc. after the IPO. There can be no assurance that any IPO will be completed.
 
Our Business of Residential Roofing and Solar Installations
 
On January 6, 2021, SJ US purchased of all work-in-progress consumer contracts of Petersen-Dean, Inc. (“PDI”) for a consideration of $0.88 million in a court-approved agreement. On February 25, 2021, SJ US closed the acquisition of substantially all operating assets of Petersen-Dean including certain construction contracts with work-in-progress billings, fixed assets, intellectual properties and other assets, for a total cash consideration of $6.85 million, plus the assumption of $11 million of outstanding balance under an account receivables financing, net off by accounts receivables pledged for the liability with net balance of PDI of $11.7 million. PDI specializes in residential roofing and solar installations across the U.S., and after acquisition, SJ US operated the business with its own brand and earned revenue of $29.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Competition
 
Solar Power Market
 
The solar power market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, and we compete with major international and domestic companies over the development of solar projects. Our major competitors include leading global players such as SunPower Corporation, First Solar, Inc., Canadian Solar, Inc., SunEdison, Inc., SolarCity Corporation, Lightsource Renewable Energy Limited, and regional players such as West Holdings Corporation, Looop Inc., and other regional and international developers.
 
We believe that we can compete favorably with our competitors given that the key competitive factors for solar project development and operation include, without limitation:
 

· | industry reputation and development track record;
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | site selection and acquisition;
--+--------------------------------


· | permit and project development experience and expertise;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | relationship with government authorities and knowledge of local policies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ability to secure high-quality PV modules and balance-of-system components at favorable prices and terms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ready access to project financing;
--+-----------------------------------


· | control over the quality, efficiency and reliability of project development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expertise in permit and project development; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | expertise in providing EPC and O&M services.
--+---------------------------------------------

However, we cannot guarantee that some of our competitors do not or will not have advantages over us in terms of greater operational, financial, technical, management or other resources in particular markets or in general. In terms of the broader energy sector, the entire solar industry faces competition from other power generation sources, including conventional sources as well as other emerging technologies. Solar power has certain advantages and disadvantages when compared to other power generating technologies. The advantages include the ability to deploy products in many sizes and configurations, install products almost anywhere in the world, provide reliable power for many applications and reduce air, water and noise pollution. Yet other energy sources have advantages which may result in electric utilities, grid companies or other off-takers to enter PPAs or other electricity purchase arrangements with companies specializing in those energy sources rather than us or other companies specializing in solar power.
 
Electric Vehicle (EV) Business
 
The electric vehicle industry is expected to be one of the fastest growing sectors over the next decade. While current penetration for electric vehicles is low, key segments of focus like the medium and light-duty vehicle segments are set to grow rapidly, driven by policy changes, incentives supporting zero-emission transportation and corporate mandates prompting large fleets to go electric.
 
Demand for medium duty electric commercial vehicles is catered to by a handful of companies that are a mix of drivetrain developers and ground up OEMs. Key drivetrain developers offering electric vehicles built on conventional internal combustion chassis similar to Phoenix products, include Motiv Power Systems, Lightning eMotors, Xos Trucks and SEA Electric. Ground-up medium duty electric vehicle manufacturers include GreenPower Bus, Lion Electric, Bollinger Motros, Rivian and Workhorse. Additionally, Type A electric school bus manufacturers competing directly with Phoenix include Lion Electric, Microbird (a division of Bluebird) and Collins. Large traditional OEMs like Freightliner, Peterbilt and Mitsubishi have also begun rolling out their all-electric Class 4 – 6 electric trucks in the US market. However, with the industry being in a nascent phase, only a few of the above manufacturers have successfully deployed a large number of vehicles with customers. Phoenix has carved itself a unique position in the market, with the highest number of class 4 electric cutaway shuttle buses and work trucks deployed to date. Our industry collaborations, market experience and customer relationships enable Phoenix to be well positioned to cater to the growing demand for electric medium-duty vehicles.
 
Our Business of Residential Roofing and Solar Installations business and Australia Distribution Business
 
As PV and energy storage technology advances and the average system costs decrease, in many cases the residential or small business owners of solar systems have effectively achieved grid parity for their systems. Aided by smart meter and virtual power plant technologies such systems can be an attractive alternative to electricity grid in many localities. We expect traditionally strong residential solar markets such as California and Australia to continue to grow, while we expect new growth from markets to emerge such as Florida, Texas and US Northeast. As the overall market grows we expect our costs of sales to decrease and our revenue and profitability to increase.
 
Hemp and CBD Business
 
Hemp and CBD are also relatively new industries that sprung up due to the legalization of recreational marijuana in many states across the United States. Being one of the first energy companies to venture into this industry, our competitive advantage in this area is being able to supplement energy needs of CBD and Hemp production from our own energy grids or solar farms. This will offset a significant portion of the costs required for production that can potentially help us to price more competitively against other companies in the industry. However, the CBD and Hemp industry is still in its early stages of development. The demand of these products have not solidified and the growth of the industry is not as strong as its recreational marijuana counterpart.
 
Business of Alfalfa and Other Related Agriculture Products
 
Our in-depth research into this market has shown that there is a growing demand for Alfalfa grass, especially in Eastern countries like China. Alfalfa grass is commonly used as stock feed for farmed animals like cows. Our history of operations in China has helped us to gain partners and grow a solid customer base over the years. Our knowledge of the Chinese market will also prove to be valuable in this venture.

Suppliers
 
There are numerous suppliers of PV modules in the solar power industry, and we have adopted a supplier-neutral approach. For both our EPC service business and global project development business, we select the suppliers based on whether we could obtain high-quality PV modules and balance-of-system components at favorable prices and payment terms. For both our EPC service and global project development business, we procure our PV modules from a broad range of suppliers including Trina Solar Limited, JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd., Xiexin Integration Technology Co., Ltd., JA Solar Holding Co., Ltd., LG Electronics, and Chint, among others.
 
Our major suppliers of our alfalfa business and CBD and hemp is the local growers near our hay processing facilities in the state of Arizona and also CBD & hemp processing facility in the state of California.
 
In March 2021, we began delivering our third generation EVs, featuring our new, Romeo Power, Inc. modular battery packs, giving customers choices among 31KwH, 63KwH, 94KwH, 125KwH, and 156KwH batteries. Our ZEUS 300 EVs are built on the Ford F-450 chassis, with Romeo Power battery and Dana TM4 SumoTM MD motors, and BTC Power battery chargers. While the relationships with our key suppliers remain strong, we conduct evaluation of all suppliers on regular basis based on their quality, reliability, cost effectiveness, warranty standards, shipping standards and set up mitigation plan accordingly.
 
SJ Australia purchases its products from the best in class PV manufacturers that offer products with strong market demand that, generally, allow us to sell the products at higher gross margins. Our leading brands in each product category include, for inverters, Fronius and SMA; for solar panels, Trina and JA, for battery storage systems, Tesla; and for BOS and mounting, Tigo, SwitchDin, Clenergy, and Mibet. SJ Australia actively reviews its product portfolio to discontinue products with low volume, low margin, or poor performance records. SJ Australia enters into agreements with its suppliers during the ordinary course of business.
 
SJ US purchases materials from leading distributors in the construction and PV industries. We also purchase key solar components, such as panels and batteries from suppliers in Asia and in the US. SJ US plans to offer its Solar4America private-label as its standard product, with third party products offered as premium choices for consumers. SJ US enters into agreements with its suppliers during the ordinary course of business.
 
Customers and Marketing
 
We have historically provided EPC and O&M services, a line of business we are still engaged in. We are also selling electricity to the grid under our IPP model as well as selling solar projects under our BT model. Customers of our EPC services include independent power developers and producers as well as commercial and industrial companies. For our global project development business, we sell electricity to power companies and other electricity off-takers, including government-owned utility companies, operating in the United States, Greece and Italy under our IPP model. Purchasers of our BT projects included utility companies, independent power developers and producers, commercial and industrial companies as well as investors in the solar business. Further, customers of our Australia distribution business include residential ones, towards which we distribute PV modules, balance of system components, solar monitoring systems and inverters.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2021, there was no sale of PV solar systems. The figures for sales of PV solar components saw an upwards trend.

As one of the early movers in the medium-duty electrification market, Phoenix Motorcars has built a reputation as one of the leading manufacturers in the segment. Our range of vehicles includes all-electric shuttle buses, flatbed trucks, utility trucks, box trucks, service van and custom bodies on a class-4 electric chassis and is used by customers across a wide range of applications including cities, transit agencies, airports, utility agencies, contractors, campuses and other commercial fleets. Phoenix Motorcars has particularly good awareness among shuttle bus customers and has the highest number of class-4 shuttle buses deployed. Further Phoenix also partnerships with industry leaders like Forest River, the largest shuttle bus manufacturer in the country and Creative Bus Sales, the largest bus dealership network to jointly sell and service the shuttle bus product. Being a sunrise industry, most of Phoenix’s fleet customers are first time EV users and Phoenix provides end-to-end electrification solutions to support their efforts. This includes not just providing vehicles, but also supporting with route planning, charging infrastructure planning, charging equipment and telematics solutions for in-service vehicles.
 
Seasonality
 
Demand for solar power products tends to be weaker during the winter months partly due to adverse weather conditions in certain regions, which complicate the installation of solar power systems. Our operating results may fluctuate from period to period based on the seasonality of industry demand for solar power products. Certain aspects of our operations are also subject to seasonal variations. For example, we may schedule significant construction activities to connect solar projects to the grids prior to a scheduled decrease in FIT rates in order to qualify for more favorable FIT policies.
 
Likewise to hemp and CBD business, demand and our operating results for hemp and CBD products fluctuate from period to period based on the seasonality of industry demand for solar power products.
 
The electric Vehicles business is not seasonal, but application and decision timelines of key incentive programs like the California HVIP program and the annual Federal Transit Administration’s LowNo program impact the timing of purchase orders for applicable customer segments.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain the types and amounts of insurance coverage that we believe are consistent with customary industry practices in all the countries where we operate. Our insurance policies cover employee-related accidents and injuries, property damage, machinery breakdowns, fixed assets, facilities and liability deriving from our activities, including environmental liability. We maintain business interruption insurance for interruptions resulting from incidents covered by insurance policies. We have not had any material claims under our insurance policies that would either invalidate our insurance policies or cause a material increase to our insurance premiums. We cannot assure you, however, that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from all risks that may arise or in amounts sufficient to prevent any material loss.
Regulations
 
We operate in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S., Japan, the U.K, Greece, Italy and Australia. We are therefore subject to complex laws, regulations and policies promulgated by the governments and government-run utilities of these jurisdictions, including FIT regulations, clean energy incentive rules and programs, laws and regulations that apply to all power producers, regulations that specifically apply to solar power project operators, EPC service providers as well as solar kit distributors, tax regulations and intellectual property laws, among others. Likewise, our hemp and CBD businesses are subject to various laws, regulations and guidelines by governmental authorities relating to, among other things, the manufacture, marketing, management, transportation, storage, sale, pricing and disposal of cannabis, U.S. hemp and cannabis-based products, and also including laws, regulations and guidelines relating to health and safety, insurance coverage, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment.
Legal Proceedings 
 
From time to time, we are involved in various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. While we cannot predict the occurrence or outcome of these proceedings with certainty, we do not believe that an adverse result in any pending legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are a party, individually or in the aggregate, would be material to our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations other than the following:

SINSIN Disputes 
 
There is dispute between the Company and SPI China (HK) Limited on one hand (hereinafter collectively, “SPI”) and SINSIN Europe Solar Asset Limited Partnership and SINSIN Solar Capital Limited Partnership on the other hand (hereinafter collectively, “SINSIN”) with respect to a share sale and purchase agreement dated September 9, 2014 (“SPA”) entered into by and between SINSIN, as vendors, and SPI, as purchasers, in relation to all of the shares in Sinsin Renewable Investment Limited, a company registered in Malta (for purpose of this section, “SRIL”). The SPA is governed by Maltese law and any disputes thereunder shall be referred to arbitration in Malta. SRIL is the direct and/or indirect owner of four (4) Greek companies under the names “JASPER PV MACEDONIA ENERGIAKI SOCIETE ANONYME”, “ORION ENERGIAKI SOCIETE ANONYME PHOTOVOLTAICON ERGON”, “ASTRAIOS ENERGIAKI SOCIETE ANONYME PHOTOVOLTAICON ERGON”, “PHOTOVOLTAICA PARKA VEROIA I SOCIETE ANONYME” (hereinafter collectively, “4 SPVs”). The 4 SPVs collectively own a number of photovoltaic parks in Greece having a total power output of 26.57 MW.
 
 Proceedings were initiated both in Greece and Malta in relation to this dispute.
 
Proceedings in Greece
 
In particular, the following judicial proceedings were initiated in Greece and are pending as of the date of this annual report:
 
A.       SINSIN’s Injunction Petition against the 4 SPVs dated January 26, 2018, with General Submission No 8118/2018, which was heard on the March 20, 2018, before the Athens One-Member First Instance Court and on which Judgement No 4212/2018 was issued on June 25,2018.
 
This Interim Measures Judgment ordered, inter alia, the following:
 
(A)       It suspends the force of the extraordinary General Meetings of the shareholders of the 4 SPVs dated December 19, 2017 on the appointment of their members of Board of Directors, until the issuance of a final judgment on the lawsuit filed by SINSIN on March 14, 2018 for the annulment of the extraordinary General Meetings of the shareholders of the 4 SPVs dated December 19, 2017.
 
(B)       It appoints an interim management of the 4 SPVs, consisting of two members elected by SINSIN (Dejun Ye and Fan Yang) and one member elected by the 4 SPVs (Hoong Khoeng Cheong), with the following, exclusively defined, competences: (a) to represent judicially and extra-judicially the 4 SPVs before any public authority and court, (b) to manage the bank accounts of the 4 SPVs, in order to, exclusively and solely, proceed with the payment of existing and current obligations of the 4 SPVs towards third parties, arising from their regular management (liabilities towards the State, employees, social security institutions, private creditors, banks), excluding the payment of any price of the shares that were transferred from SINSIN to SPI pursuant to the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014, (c) to collect the proceeds of the 4 SPVs, especially from selling electric energy from the photovoltaic parks of the 4 SPVs to the Operator of Electricity Market (“LAGIE”), which (proceeds) should be subsequently deposited to the bank accounts of the 4 SPVs, with the exclusive purpose being the payment of the above under element b΄ obligations of the 4 SPVs (i.e., not for the payment of the purchase price of the shares transferred by SINSIN to SPI pursuant to the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014.)
 
(C)       It allows the petitioners to register with the Greek General Commercial Registry (“GEMI”) the appointed interim management of the 4 SPVs with the above competences.
 
B.       SINSIN’s and Mr. Dejun Ye’s lawsuit against the 4 SPVs dated March 14, 2018, with General Submission No. 25276/2018 (the “Annulment Lawsuit”). By virtue of the Annulment Lawsuit, the petitioners request the annulment of the December 19, 2017 General Assemblies’ Resolutions of the 4 SPVs, which appointed a Board of Directors elected by their shareholders SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited, companies belonging to SPI.

SPI and their subsidiaries opposed the above-mentioned petition. SPI and their subsidiaries SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited filed an Additional Intervention in the above pending trial under General No. 40772/2018 in favor of the 4 SPVs requesting the rejection of the Annulment Lawsuit.
 
By virtue of its Decision No 2318/2019, the Athens Multimember Court of First Instance suspended the issuance of a definitive judgment on SINSIN’s petition until the issuance of a final decision on the case pending before the Malta arbitration tribunal with respect to the SPA.
 
C.       By virtue of a petition under General Submission No 7294/2018 dated January 25, 2018 filed by SINSIN before the Athens Local Court against SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited, SINSIN lacking an enforcement title, requested the above Athens Local Court to allow them to proceed to an auction of the pledged shares of the 4 SPVs, in order to satisfy their claim amounting to EUR 38.3 million, plus interest and expenses, for the outstanding purchase price of the 4 SPVs shares under the above-mentioned share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014.
 
SRIL, Veltimo Limited and Photovoltaica Parka Veroia 1 Malta Limited opposed the above-mentioned petition.
 
The above petition was heard on October 23, 2018. The Athens Local Court issued Decision No. 350/2019, which suspended the issuance of a definitive judgment on SINSIN’s petition until the issuance of a final decision on the case pending before the Malta arbitration tribunal with respect to the SPA.
 
 Proceedings in Malta
 
In June 2018, the Company, as Claimant, filed arbitration proceedings in Malta against SINSIN as respondents for an alleged breach of a share sale and purchase agreement dated September 6, 2014 entered into by and between the respondents as sellers and the claimant as purchaser in relation to all of the shares in SRIL. The claimant is requesting the payment of damages from the respondents.
 
The respondents have filed separate arbitration proceedings in Malta against the Company, requesting payment of the balance of the purchase price due in terms of the share purchase agreement mentioned above (stated to be EUR38,054,000) together with interest. The Company contested these claims. Meanwhile, SINSIN obtained a precautionary garnishee order against the Company as security for its claims and had the same order served on SRIL with a view to freezing any payments that may be due by SRIL to SPI. In February, 2019, SINSIN also obtained the issue of a precautionary warrant of prohibitory injunction prohibiting SPI from selling or otherwise transferring its shares in SRIL. 
 
On October 29, 2020, awards were issued in both cases, pursuant to which the tribunal dismissed all of SPI’s claims and admitted SINSIN’s counterclaim for payment of the balance of the price of €38,054,000, with interest at 6% accruing from November 30, 2015, on half of this amount, and from June 20, 2016, on the other half. SINSIN’s claims for additional damages were rejected. Costs of the case filed by SPI ( case 5320/18) are to be borne by SPI, while the costs for case 5532/18 are to be borne 80% by SPI. On November 13, 2020, SPI filed Appeal Applications to appeal the awards with the Court of Appeal (Inferior Jurisdiction). The Appeal were eventually heard on 23 April 2021. By virtue of two judgements delivered contemporaneously on 12 November 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed both Appeals filed by SPI on the procedural ground of non-appealability of the Awards. Following consideration of the appeal judgements, the application for retrial was filed on the ground of wrong application of the law. The applications for retrial were filed on 29 November 2021 together with applications for the suspension of the execution of the Awards pending the determination of the retrial applications. The latter applications were accepted by the court pending the consideration of the applications for retrial. Following a hearing held on 16 March 2022 during which the parties were given the opportunity to make final submissions with regard to the application for retrial, on 30 March 2022 the Court of Appeal delivered its final judgement by virtue of which the applications for retrial of the Appeal were rejected. In consequence, the order for the suspension of the enforcement of the Awards was also lifted. While no further appeal or right of retrial exists in Malta, SPI is yet to obtain advice as to whether any other options are available to it to suspend the enforcement of the Awards. Meanwhile, SPI is also taking advice with regard to the time that will be required for SINSIN to complete the procedures necessary for the enforcement of the Awards in Malta and in Greece, and preliminary indications are that relevant procedures are unlikely to be completed during the course of 2022. Confirmatory advice in this regard is pending, however.

Shengrun Dispute
 
Solar Juice USA Inc. (“SolarJuice”), a subsidiary of the Company, submitted a complaint in the local court in the county of Santa Clara in the State of California on or about June 11, 2020 against Shengrun Int’l Industry Group, Inc., a California corporation (“Shengrun”) and Sophie Harrison, a resident of the State of California and the purported controlling person of Shengrun. In March 2019, SolarJuice and Shengrun entered into a real property purchase agreement pursuant to which SolarJuice shall purchase from Shengrun a real property located in Santa Clara in the State of California. Subsequently, SolarJuice made a down payment of $3,132,000 to Shengrun for the proposed transaction, and Sophie Harrison provided personal guarantee that if Shengrun does not convey the property to SolarJuice or if SolarJuice withdraws from the transaction, she would be personally liable for the return of the down payment to SolarJuice. As of the date hereof, the subject property has not been conveyed to SolarJuice, neither has Shengrun or Ms. Harrison refunded the down payment to SolarJuice. Counsel for SolarJuice on this matter reasonably expects that the court shall render a verdict against Shengrun and Ms. Harrison personally (as related to the personal guarantee) and in favor of SolarJuice. However, the counsel does not have the information to assess whether Shengrun or Ms. Harrison has the assets available for the governmental authorities or the Company to enforce such verdict.
 
AHP Dispute
 
The Company and its various subsidiaries are listed as defendants on a claim for fraudulent transfer pending before superior court of the state of Arizona.

Valta Solar Disputes
 
The Company is respondent on a claim for declaratory relief pending in arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. The action was instituted on November 30, 2020. The dispute relates to the purchase of a solar photovoltaic energy generation facility located in Kahuku, Oahu, Hawaii and certain amounts owed to the Company under the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement entered into with Valta Solar, LLC relating to that purchase. There is no claim for damages against the Company, only a request for prevailing party attorneys’ fees and costs. In addition, the Company has asserted a counterclaim for the purchase price under the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement. The parties to the litigation entered into a confidential settlement agreement on December 31, 2021. The arbitration is stayed pending completion of the terms of the settlement agreement.
 
The Company and its various subsidiaries are listed as defendants on a claim for false promise, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract pending before superior court of the state of California. The action was instituted on April 15, 2021. The dispute relates to the purchase of a solar photovoltaic energy generation facility located in Ocean View, Hawaii and Captain Cook, Hawaii. Valta Solar, LLC and the Company entered into a letter of Intent, giving Valta a six-month exclusive right to negotiate with the Company for the purchase of the Kona/Ocean View projects. The transaction was never consummated. The parties to the litigation entered into a confidential settlement agreement on December 31, 2021.

Sulus Dispute
 
The Company is respondent on a claim pending in arbitration before ADR Services, Inc. SPI Solar, Inc., agreed to purchase from Sulus LLC certain solar photovoltaic Projects under a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (“MIPA”) dated July 15, 2019. The MIPA contained a project-by-project purchase price escalation clause conditioned upon each Project meeting certain requirements and being awarded into Oregon’s Community Solar Program. Sulus LLC alleges that four Projects, Belvedere Solar LLC, Manchester Solar LLC, Dover Solar LLC and Clayfield Solar LLC, have met the MIPA conditions for the price escalation, and that two Projects, Cork Solar LC and Waterford Solar LLC, still may meet the price escalation conditions. For the four Projects alleged to meet the conditions, Sulus LLC alleges additional compensation is due, and for the two Projects that Sulus LLC alleges may meet the conditions, Sulus LLC estimates additional compensation is due as well. SPI Solar, Inc., denies the allegations, that the MIPA conditions have not been met, and specifically that any of the Projects have yet been awarded into Oregon’s Community Solar Program. It is also SPI Solar, Inc.’s position that the time for the Projects to meet the conditions for the price escalation in the MIPA has passed. On December 13, 2021, an order from the arbitrator was issued and awarded the full amount to Sulus LLC. The cross petitions to enter judgment on the award and to vacate it were timely filed by Sulus LLC and the Company, respectively. It is our opinion that the underlying arbitration was wrongly decided. However, because the grounds to vacate a private arbitration award are limited, we believe that the outcome before the circuit court is uncertain. The legal process is ongoing with resolution expected during the calendar year 2022.
 
NAAC Dispute 
 
The Company is currently involved in a potential lawsuit against Native American Agricultural Company (“NAAC”) regarding our newly set up CBD and hemp business. The Company was required to make a down payment of $324,125 to NAAC on or before July 31, 2019, and the Company timely made this payment. Subsequently, however, NAAC failed to comply with or perform the Agreement dated as of July 24 2019 entered into by and between CBD and Hemp Group Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Hemp Biotechnology, Inc. and NAAC. First, in August 2019, representatives of the Company visited the farm where NAAC was growing the hemp. The conditions of the plants and growing operations appeared to be deficient and not up to industry standards. Second, NAAC failed to provide the required Milestone Report and Financial Reports. Finally, NAAC failed to deliver any of the hemp plants by November 30, 2019, or at all, and refused and failed to return Company’s down payment and to make whole for the damages the Company has suffered. As such, the Company believes NAAC was in default under the Agreement. The Company sent two demand letters to NAAC on October 25, 2019 and November 25, 2019 respectively without any response from NAAC. Mr. Da Mu Lin and Mr. Yonglei Zhang provided personal guarantee to guaranty the full performance and contractual obligations of NAAC. In March 2022, the Company has filed the complaint against Mr. Da Mu Lin and Mr. Yonglei Zhang for fraud in the inducement, unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.
 
However, an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a specific interim period or year.

Economic Substance Law
 
Since January 1, 2019, the Cayman Islands adopted certain laws and regulations in response to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)Forum on Harmful Tax Practices, which sets the global standard that requires companies to have substantial activities in a jurisdiction (also known as “economic substance”).To date, the Cayman Islands have passed or adopted the International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) Act, (as varied by the Regulations which are defined below and includes any revision thereof or amendment thereto from time to time, the “ES Law”), the International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) (Prescribed Dates) Regulations, 2018, the International Tax Co-Operation (Economic Substance) (Amendment of Schedule) Regulations, 2019 and the International Co-Operation (Economic Substance) (Amendment of Schedule) (No. 2) Regulations. 2019 (collectively referred to as, the “Regulations”), and the updated related guidance was published on July 13, 2020.
 
A relevant entity conducting any relevant activity must satisfy the economic substance test (the “ES Test”) as set out in the ES Law. Failure to comply with requirements of the ES Law may result in substantial fines and/or imprisonment.
 
Considering SPI Energy is a tax resident of the in US, the Company has determined that it is not a Relevant Entity for the purposes of the ES Law.
 
U.S. Federal Income Taxation
 
Introduction
 
The following discussion is a summary of U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the ordinary shares. This discussion applies only to holders that hold the ordinary shares as capital assets. This discussion is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to specific holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships and the partners therein, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, U.S. expatriates, persons who have acquired the ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar or persons that own (or are deemed to own) 5% or more of our stock. This discussion does not address the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on net investment income or any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations or, other than to the limited extent set forth below, any U.S. federal estate or gift tax considerations.
 
As used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of the ordinary shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United States persons or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.
 
As used in this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of the ordinary shares that is not a partnership (or entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and not a U.S. Holder.
 
Treatment of the Company as a U.S. Corporation for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes
 
Even though we are organized as a Cayman Islands exempted company, due to the application of Section 7874(b) of the Code, we are treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and all purposes under the Code.

U.S. Holders
 
Distributions
 
We do not currently anticipate paying distributions on our ordinary shares. In the event that distributions are paid, however, the gross amount of such distributions generally will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income as dividend income on the date of receipt to the extent that the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits as so computed, it will be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares and, to the extent the amount of such distribution exceeds such adjusted tax basis, will be treated as gain from the sale of such ordinary shares.
 
Subject to certain conditions, including a minimum holding period requirement, dividends received by individuals and other non-corporate U.S. Holders, generally will be subject to reduced rates of taxation, and dividends paid by us will be eligible for the “dividends received” deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends received from U.S. corporations.
 
Sale or Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares
 
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon a sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized from such sale or disposition and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such ordinary shares. Such gain or loss generally will be a capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss (taxable at a reduced rate for individuals and other non-corporate U.S. Holders) if, on the date of sale or disposition, such ordinary shares were held by such U.S. Holder for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
 
Non-U.S. Holders
 
Distributions
 
Distributions treated as dividends (see “—U.S. Holders—Distributions” above) paid to a Non-U.S. Holder are treated as income derived from sources within the United States and generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of such dividend, or at a lower rate provided by an applicable income tax treaty.
 
Even if a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a lower treaty rate, U.S. federal withholding tax will be imposed at a 30% rate (rather than the lower treaty rate) on dividend payments to a Non-U.S. Holder, unless (i) the Non-U.S. Holder has furnished a valid U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E or other documentary evidence establishing such holder’s entitlement to the lower treaty rate with respect to such payments, and (ii) in the case of actual or constructive dividends paid to a foreign entity, (a) if such entity is, or holds the ordinary shares through, a foreign financial institution, any such foreign financial institution (x) has entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities information about its accountholders (including certain investors in such institution), (y) satisfies an exemption from the obligation to enter into such an agreement, or (z) satisfies the terms of an applicable intergovernmental agreement, and (b) if required, such entity has provided the withholding agent with a certification identifying its direct and indirect U.S. owners.
 
If a Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.
 
Sale or Other Disposition
 
Any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares by a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless (i) the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition, and certain other conditions are met, or (ii) in the case of the sale or disposition of ordinary shares on or after January 1, 2019, the requirements described in item (ii) in the second paragraph under “—Distributions,” above, are satisfied. Each Non-U.S. Holder is encouraged to consult with its own tax advisor regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on its investment in ordinary shares and the potential for a refund or credit in the case of any withholding tax.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 
Payments of dividends or of proceeds on the disposition of ordinary shares to U.S. Holders may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless the U.S. Holder (i) is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and demonstrates this fact, or (ii) provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Non-U.S. Holders may be required to provide documentary evidence establishing they are not subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Payments of dividends to Non-U.S. Holders and the amount of U.S. federal withholding tax imposed on such dividends must generally be reported annually to the IRS. A similar report will be sent to Non-U.S. Holders. Copies of these reports may be made available to tax authorities in a holder’s country of residence.
 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis.
 
U.S. Federal Estate Tax
 
Ordinary shares owned or treated as owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as specifically defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of death will be included in the individual’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes and may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise.
