Introduction



Blonder Tongue, with its subsidiary R. L. Drake Holdings, LLC (“Drake”), is a technology research and development (“R&D”) company with U.S.-based manufacturing, that delivers a wide range of products and services to major telecommunications, cable and fiber optic service delivery operators, as well as broadcasters and media production companies. For over 70 years, Blonder Tongue Labs and Drake Digital products have provided the latest technology for telecom company Central Offices (COs), cable operator headends, broadcaster studios (together “Telecom”), as well as to lodging/hospitality, multi-dwelling units/apartments (“MDU”) and a range of business to business (“B-B”) customers at a wide range of locations including university campuses, healthcare/hospitals, fitness centers, government facilities, military bases, prisons, airports, sports stadiums/arenas, entertainment venues/casinos, retail stores, and other small-medium businesses. These applications are also variously described as small and medium sized businesses in commercial, institutional, or enterprise environments, and will be referred to herein collectively as “SMB”. The customers we serve also include business entities distributing and installing private data delivery, broadband and video networks in these environments, including the world’s largest cable television operators, telecommunications providers and satellite providers, as well as integrators, architects, engineers of the next generation of Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) streaming video service providers.



The Company continues to be focused on the needs of an expanding group of customers, providing high quality, ultra-high reliability technology products to meet their needs and supporting those products following deployment. For over 70 years Blonder Tongue has provided innovative solutions based on continually advancing technology. Since its founding, Blonder Tongue has continued to keep abreast of evolving technologies, from analog to digital television, Hybrid-Fiber Coax (“HFC”) networks with Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) edge devices, High Definition (“HD”) and Ultra HD (“4K”) and (“UHD”) video encoding and transcoding, IPTV processing and distribution, and most recently with the introduction of multiscreen Adaptive Bit Rate (“ABR”) technologies and high-speed data delivery and reception technologies.



The cable and telecommunications markets have reacted quickly to consumer demands for additional services by integrating multiple technologies into existing networks, providing consumers with high-speed internet access in addition to enhanced video offerings. Today, video offerings have expanded from traditional broadcast linear delivery to the living room TV to live streaming to any device in your home or on the go. Traditional TV content is now available in any format to be viewed on tablets, mobile phones, computers or gaming consoles. SMB and IPTV service providers are migrating their video-on-demand (“VOD”) architecture to IPTV, and a multiscreen ecosystem. Service operators and SMB businesses are upgrading their networks to have the capability to deliver 4K video resolution content to TVs and adding the capability of IPTV streaming to additional, normally small screens, thereby expanding viewer access to HD content on any IP-connected devices. The infrastructure requirements to enable IP streaming with a wide variety of resolutions and ABR bit rates provides the Company with an opportunity to market and sell its expanded IP streaming encoders and digital product lines.



Both the IPTV and SMB markets are forecast to grow over the next few years. The IPTV market was valued at $72.24 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $194.21 billion by 2026; a CAGR of 17.89%. The SMB market segments that the Company serves have been focused on the migration from HFC to IPTV networks. The Company has expanded its video product line portfolio to address the growth of IP streaming. The Company has collaborated with large telecommunications operators and with leading cable television (“CATV”) Multiple System Operators (“MSOs”) to produce new cost-effective video encoder and transcoder products for IP support of both traditional broadcast and Public, Education and Government (“PEG”) video content. The company has also been involved recently in initiatives for regional content acquisition for backhaul, ingest and redistribution from centralized facilities using modern IP, IPTV and CDN video distribution architectures, these technologies taken together are referred to as Over The Top or “OTT”. In 2018, the Company introduced the NeXgen Gateway (“NXG”) digital video signal processing platform to specifically address the service provider challenges of migrating from traditional CATV HFC based topologies and technologies to Internet Protocol (“IP”) and IPTV based topologies and technologies. As the industry has begun to adopt UHD, 4K, and High Efficiency Video Coding (“HEVC”) encoding, the Company has begun to produce products to support these emerging requirements. IPTV growth worldwide is projected to result in 398 million subscribers by 2026. NXG sales were $1,924,000 in 2021 and $705,000 in 2020, respectively.

In January 2020, the Company began implementing a strategic plan to improve operating results and increase shareholder value. This plan consists of:




● | Rationalizing operating expenses to anticipated revenue and income levels
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focusing R&D on short-term high-confidence opportunities with compelling ROI 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding sales and marketing efforts directly to service operators 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Streamlining manufacturing operations and simplifying product offerings, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing gross margins 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company has entered into and/or renewed several agreements through which it has acquired rights to use and incorporate certain proprietary technologies in its digital encoder, transcoder and NXG lines of products, including:




1. | Widevine / Google LLC, DRM License Agreement for content partners and OEMs (Google LLC). 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Verimatrix ViewRight IPTV and ViewRight IPTV Professional License to Distribute, License to Integrate and Client Integration Agreement. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Implementation and System License Agreement with Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation (“Dolby Labs”) for Dolby Digital Plus Professional Encoder, 5.1 and 2 channel licensed technology. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | License Agreement with LG Electronics as a Pro:Idiom content Protection System Manufacturer. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Ownership from the Motion Picture Experts Group of an MPEG-2 4:2:2 Profile High Level Video Encoder IP core. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Widevine / Google LLC License Agreement grants the Company the right to manufacture, label and sell professional Digital Rights Management (“DRM”) enabled products that include certain Widevine DRM technologies.



The Verimatrix ViewRight IPTV, ViewRight IPTV Professional License to Distribute, License to Integrate and Client Integration Agreement grants the Company the right to integrate the Company’s products with Verimatrix ViewRight IPTV and ViewRight IPTV Professional DRM technologies and to sell and distribute the resulting integrated products to Service Operator customers that hold Verimatrix licenses to deploy the associated DRM technologies.



The Dolby® Labs License Agreement grants the Company the right to manufacture, label and sell professional digital encoder products and consumer digital decoder products and to use the Dolby trademarks. This technology has a number of improvements aimed at increasing quality at a given bit rate compared with legacy Dolby Digital (AC-3). Most notably, it offers increased bit rates, support for more audio channels, improved coding techniques to reduce compression artifacts, and backward compatibility with existing AC-3 hardware.



The LG Electronics license agreement provides the Company with certain technology necessary for the provision of Pro:Idiom encryption and decryption devices for the hospitality industry. Almost all of the high value content owners require that service providers protect the content by employing this technology. Consequently, content can be transferred through and among these devices only if incorporating this technology.



The Pro:Idiom digital technology platform provides the hospitality market with a robust, secure DRM system, ensuring rapid, broad deployment of HD television (“HDTV”) and other high-value digital content to licensed users in the lodging industry. Lodging industry leaders such as World Cinema Inc. have licensed the Pro:Idiom DRM system. A growing number of content providers have demonstrated their acceptance of Pro:Idiom by licensing their HD content for delivery by Pro:Idiom licensees.



The MPEG-2 Encoder IP core has a unique compression engine capable of creating HD MPEG-2 real-time encoding of a single channel of 1080i/720p/480i video. The use of this real-time encoding technique enables the Company to provide broadcast MPEG-2 HD and SD encoding. MPEG-2 is widely used as the format of digital television signals that are broadcast by terrestrial (over-the-air), cable, and direct broadcast satellite TV systems.

The H.264/AVC is a video compression standard that enables a compelling solution for growing IP video services. The H.264 HD Encoder core has the capability to cut the bandwidth requirement for digital video delivery in half when compared against MPEG-2 encoders. This essentially facilitates the transmission of twice the number of programs in a given bandwidth. The use of this H.264 encoding technology enables the Company to provide high quality video at higher resolutions like 720p, 1080i and 1080p. H.264 is a widely used format for transmitting high quality digital television signals over IP and Wi-Fi networks. The Company started shipping the H.264 capable encoders in 2012.



The H.265/HEVC technology is a video compression standard that enables IP and IPTV video services to be better prepared for transmission and streaming over even narrower and less robust networks as compared to both MPEG-2 and H.264 technologies. HEVC is and is expected to be primarily used by current and future internet based and private IP based over-the-top video streaming services and in the near future for satellite and terrestrial transmissions. The Company began to ship HEVC capable encoders and transcoders in 2020.



Secure Reliable Transport (“SRT”) technology is a video and IP network oriented forward error correction (“FEC”), security and reliability application level protocol designed to allow for high confidence transmission of compressed video and audio content over the open internet or over privately owned IP networks. SRT has been standardized by the SRT Alliance, consisting of a group of international participating companies. The Company completed its implementation of SRT and began shipping SRT capable products supporting video encoder, transcoder and IP network interfaces in 2021.



The Advanced Encryption Standard (“AES”) technology is a US National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) standard for the protection of electronic data, including data based content such as digitized audio and video transmissions. Blonder Tongue Laboratories has broadened the use of and implementations of AES technology across a wide range of product lines and use cases over the course of 2020 and 2021.



MPEG-DASH and HLS are the two primary Adaptive Bit-Rate (“ABR”) technologies used in internet, IPTV and Wi-Fi based video delivery in the world today, enabling multi-screen delivery and optimization of video quality to the available bandwidth of an internet connection to television, phone, tablet or other viewing locations. The Company completed initial ABR technology and product implementations in 2021.



In 2019, the Company initiated a consumer premise equipment (“CPE”) sales initiative. The products were primarily comprised of Android-based IPTV set top boxes targeted to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 telecommunications and fiber optics based service providers. Total CPE product sales, including product accessories and replacement parts, were $1,120,000 in 2021 and $4,165,000 in 2020.



The Company’s manufacturing is located primarily in its facility in Old Bridge, New Jersey (the “Old Bridge Facility”) with a small portion of overall product production supported by key contract manufacturers located in Ohio, Taiwan, South Korea and the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company currently manufactures the large majority of its digital products, including the latest NXG, Clearview, Aircaster and Drake series product lines, as well as other digital signal processing product models at its Old Bridge, New Jersey Facility. Since 2007 the Company has been manufacturing certain high- volume, labor intensive products, including certain of the Company’s analog products, in the PRC, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement that governs the production of products that may from time to time be the subject of purchase orders submitted by (and in the discretion of) the Company. The Company does not currently anticipate the transfer of any additional products to the PRC for manufacture. Since 2019 the Company also has been manufacturing certain high-volume, labor intensive products in Taiwan and South Korea. This product mix represents a small percentage of the Company’s revenue but allows the Company to benefit from relatively favorable tariff policies. Since 2021, the Company has begun outsourcing a small percentage of product-specific manufacturing to a contract manufacturer in Ohio. Manufacturing products at the Company’s Old Bridge Facility and in Ohio, the PRC, Taiwan and South Korea enables the Company to realize cost reductions and, with regard to Ohio, Taiwan and South Korea, favorable tariff treatment while maintaining a competitive position and time-to-market advantages.



The Company was incorporated in November, 1988, under the laws of Delaware as GPS Acquisition Corp. for the purpose of acquiring the business of Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, which was founded in 1950 by Ben H. Tongue and Isaac S. Blonder to design, manufacture and supply a line of electronics and systems equipment principally for the private cable industry. Following the acquisition, the Company changed its name to Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. The Company completed the initial public offering of its shares of common stock in December, 1995. The address of the Company’s principal executive offices is One Jake Brown Road, Old Bridge, New Jersey 08857, and its telephone number at that location is (732) 679-4000.



Strategy 



Telecom



The primary end locations of the Company’s products have evolved to focus on Telco COs, cable operator headends, and local content ingest locations for Telco, cable and fiber optic based service operators. We provide a wide range of products to meet the special needs of these applications, and we serve many types of customers, from large Telco and cable companies to distribution channels, integrators and private contractors. We sell to companies installing or distributing video and data delivery products including:

● | Telephone and fiber optics telecommunications operators (both large and small) that design, package, install and in most cases operate, upgrade and maintain the systems they build; cable system operators (both large and small) that design, package, install and in most instances operate, upgrade and maintain the systems they build; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Television broadcasters and video production facilities that create signals for redistribution and require digital encoding, transcoding, transmission and encryption/security technology; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Telephone, fiber optics, and cable-based telecommunications operators who deploy their services in the Lodging, Hospitality and Assisted Living Markets; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SMB system operators that operate, upgrade, and maintain the systems that are in their facilities, or contractors that install, upgrade and maintain these systems in a wide variety of applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The key to proactively responding to the evolving needs of the foregoing Telecom environment is to build a suite of product solutions that are optimized for the operator’s existing infrastructure, as well as future strategy. Operators look for the following features when selecting technology:




● | Versatility for Now, providing multiple source inputs and different output formats, including simultaneous IPTV, QAM, and NTSC analog television capability. OTT technology support, off-air local program ingest, locally generated content, and national broadcasts can all be viewed on televisions via coax, as well as on desktops, phones and tablets, and other connected devices via an IP network. This allows operators to expand the reach of their video without having to run additional wiring throughout a facility and optimize the use of existing infrastructures. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flexibility for the Future, recognizing that even if an operator is not utilizing IPTV, QAM and NTSC analog outputs today, these features may be needed tomorrow. Operators seek to choose scalable technology that can keep up with advances in system architecture and allow them to best leverage existing data and Wi-Fi infrastructure, without overburdening it. This includes considerations for TV Everywhere (bring your own content/device) as well as Ultra-HD and 4K resolution television. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Affordability, identifying high-quality, cost-effective, innovative solutions with a strong performance-to-cost ratio, is the key to ensure that the service provider can offer a competitively priced package to their residential, business and enterprise customers by focusing on the features required and its management, including remote setup, monitoring and diagnostics through an IP interface and potentially providing a hot spare, hot swap or automatic failover capability. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The functions and features of the Blonder Tongue NXG, Clearview, Aircaster and Drake series product lines are specifically targeted to deliver comprehensive and cost-effective solutions to all the market needs described in the forgoing paragraphs.



A key component of the Company’s growth strategy is to leverage its reputation across a comprehensive product line, offering one-stop-shop convenience to the telco, cable, fiber optic, broadcast and professional markets and deliver products having a high performance-to-cost ratio. The Company has historically enjoyed, and continues to enjoy, a leading position in specific portions of the Telecom market segments that it serves.



SMB



The ongoing evolution of the Company’s product lines for the SMB marketplace and for service operators and integrators serving the SMB marketplace focus on the increased needs created in digital technology by digital video, IPTV, HDTV and 4K signals, and the transport of these signals over state-of-the-art broadband, ethernet, Wi-Fi and fiber optic networks. The Company has begun to renew R&D and new product efforts in this market segment recently as the SMB markets have begun recovery.
CPE



In 2019, the Company initiated a consumer premise equipment (“CPE”) sales initiative, comprised primarily of Android-based IPTV set top boxes to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cable and telecommunications service providers. This strategic initiative was designed to secure direct relationships with a wide range of service providers, and increase sales of the Company’s Telecom and SMB products by the BT Premier Distributors to those same service providers, during. In 2021, the Company determined to de-emphasize CPE products and strategy due to the initiative’s low gross margin. Total CPE product sales, including product accessories and replacement parts, were $1,120,000 in 2021 and $4,165,000 in 2020. and accounted for approximately 7% and 25% of the Company’s 2021 and 2020 revenues, respectively. CPE related contribution to net income has not had a material impact on the Company’s performance.

Markets Overview 



For the last 40 years, the television industry has been dominated by traditional cable operators, who subsequently expanded into high-speed internet, telephony, and wireless services and are currently estimated to have 46.5 million video subscribers in the U.S. market. The penetration of wireless and direct-broadcast satellite (“DBS”) (such as DIRECTV® and DISH Network®) in the video market, while reduced, still has a combined subscriber count of approximately 17.5 million. Telephone companies (i.e. Verizon) also compete with cable operators for services on a national level, delivering video, high-speed internet and telephony services direct to the home or to the curb with an estimate of over 6.5 million video subscribers.



With IPTV technology comes additional market pressures and opportunities. First, there is the matter of alternative TV services riding OTT on existing high-speed data infrastructures, where the delivered video is not part of the service provider’s own video content or service. Examples include Web-delivered video such as Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and Apple TV. Cable, satellite and telco service providers have been innovating to provide additional service offerings to compete with lower cost OTT television providers (subscribers exceeding 300 million globally). In addition, content providers such as Disney, NBC, HBO, SHOWTIME and CBS have deployed their own streaming services, without requiring a cable TV subscription. Streaming service subscribers are now larger in count than cable, DBS and telco TV subscribers. With the advent of “TV Everywhere”, where video is displayed not only on the traditional television, but also on personal computers and mobile devices, service providers are trying to tackle not only technological challenges associated with these offerings, but also content management and customer authentication. The idea that the consumer is at the center, and not the hardware or the network, is revolutionizing how video (and media) content is delivered.



The long-term implications of these developments are increased competition for the provision of services and a trend toward delivery of these services using IP technologies over the open internet, and IPTV technologies over private networks. This continuing major market transition has resulted in changing consumer expectations, placing the residential video delivery networks, business-to-business, lodging and institutional markets under pressure to install new infrastructure and upgrade existing networks. Each sub-market mentioned above has different network upgrade cycles, but to remain competitive the Company has been and must continue to increase its product offerings for digital television, IP and IPTV technologies, encoding, decoding and transcoding, and support of a wider range of digital media delivery applications.



Cable Television



Most cable operators, large and small, have built networks with various combinations of fiber optic and coax cable to deliver television, internet and telephone services on one drop cable. Cable television deployment of fiber optic trunk has been completed in all deployed cable systems. The HFC network architecture is employed to provide digital video, OTT, HDTV, IPTV, high speed internet, and digital telephone service. With the adoption of new technology developed by a newly combined SCTE and CableLabs® standards organization, the cable industry is using “edge” devices, node splitting and digital video switching to increase both services and subscriber capacity from each existing node as well as lowering the cost to create new nodes in their deployment architectures, to accommodate IPTV offerings in both residential and B-B market deployments. Further, the Company has recently announced a series of products and product derivatives tailored to aid a subset of cable service providers, running specific security technologies on their networks, to expand their IP television deployments to service their business customers as well as residential customers. All of these networks are potential users of our product offerings.



Assisted Living/MDU/Hospitality



Historically, in response to various privately-owned video distribution network property owners seeking additional revenue streams and their tenants and guests demanding increased in-room technology enabled services, telco and cable operators serving the hospitality market sought to provide more programs (especially in HD), and enhanced interactivity. Initially installed in higher-end properties and hospitality properties, HD conversion is continuing today to complete all properties including older Assisted Living and Nursing Homes, Hospitals, MDUs and also now smaller hotels and motels, all of which are being upgraded and outfitted with enhanced technology to provide a full suite of HD programs and video streaming services.



More recently, the competition among telco and cable providers to the Assisted Living, MDU and Hospitality industries has shifted from a previous emphasis on VOD, to providing an ever-increasing number of HD programs and the capability of offering streaming OTT television services. The Company believes that the demand for HD based headends that support free-to-guest service and OTT television, will continue to grow in the near term. The rate of growth is limited by the costs associated with replacing all televisions in a property with flat screen Pro:Idiom compatible televisions, the infrastructure required to support OTT television, authentication and system management issues. For several years, the Company has been providing a unique system solution to the largest hotel brands worldwide through the Company’s network of hotelier approved system integrator and operator customers. The system consists of DOCSIS 3.0 and 3.1 compliant cable modem termination systems (“CMTS”) and cable modems (“CM”) and is unique in that it is the only system approved by that hotelier that is able to provide a combination of the following services: linear TV, OTT, DOCSIS-based ethernet, and Wi-Fi from a common mini-CATV-type HFC-based infrastructure.

SMB-Small and Medium Sized Businesses 



The Company defines its target SMB markets to also include educational campus environments, correctional facilities, sports stadiums and airport terminals. All of these seemingly unrelated facilities contain private video and data distribution networks that are dependent on either locally generated or externally sourced video and/or data content. As the advanced technologies of distance learning, HDTV and IPTV permeate the market, institutional facilities are embracing these technologies to achieve site specific goals. The following are examples of the types of applications:




● | Public, Educational and Government (“PEG”) Town Hall Meetings, Religious Broadcasts, Local Sports 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-Office - Doctor, Dentist and Corporate Offices
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Campus & Stadium – Redistribution of content across large, complex properties and facilities
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Education and Entertainment 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distance Learning 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employee Facing- Training and Company Messaging 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hotel Lobby Events and Advertising 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company traditionally benefited from a very strong share of this market with its Analog Video Headend and Distribution Products. We anticipate that we will continue to be a leader in this market with our digital video solutions and our evolving IP and IPTV platforms.



International



The Company has authorized distributors and sales agents in various locations outside the United States, but the Company primarily manufactures products for sale in the USA and North America. Historically, international sales have not materially contributed to the Company’s revenue base. In 2021 the Company began providing small quantities of video encoder and transcoder equipment to service providers in Mexico. This line of business is not expected to have material impact on the Company’s overall performance.
Additional Considerations



The evolution of technology with respect to video, internet and telephone services continues at a rapid pace. Cable TV’s QAM video continues to compete with DIRECTV® and EchoStar’s DBS service and cable modems compete with digital subscriber lines and fiber-to-the-home offered by regional telephone companies. Telephone companies are building national fiber optic networks and are delivering video, internet and telephone services directly to the home over fiber optic cable, and digital telephone is being offered by cable companies and others in competition with traditional phone companies. The convergence of data and video communications continues, wherein computer and television systems merge. This merging of technologies is extending services and content delivery to mobile smart phone devices and tablet computers with over-the-air data delivery competing with cable-delivered services.



Larger MSOs have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning to all-digital platforms (and in most instances based upon the MPEG-4/H.264 codec technology). Satellite DBS television, digitally compressed programming and IP delivery require headend products, set-top decoding receivers, or digital terminal adapters, to convert the transmitted signals back to analog or HDMI format so that they may be viewed on television sets. The split of analog and digital offerings provided to customers varies as a function of the size of the operator and their deployment strategy. For example, the majority of private cable and other smaller service providers continue to deliver an analog television signal on standard channels to subscribers’ television sets using headend products at some distribution point in their networks or employ set-top boxes or digital terminal adapters at each television set.

Key Products



Blonder Tongue’s products can be separated according to function and technology. Five key categories account for the majority of the Company’s revenue–Encoders and Transcoders, NXG, Coax Distribution, CPE and Digital Modulation:

● | Encoder/Transcoder Products are used by a system operator for encoding and transcoding of digital video. Transcoders convert video files from one codec compression format to another to allow the video to be viewed across different platforms and devices. We offer a broad line of 4K/UHD, HD and SD, MPEG-2, MPEG-4/H.264, and HEVC/H.265 capable encoders and transcoders optimized for Telecom customers and environments. One example is a line of enhanced encoders optimized for the extreme demands of broadcasting live sports, another is a cost-effective MPEG-2/H.264 encoder for IP support of PEG channels tailored to receive and groom regional content and deliver it across the open internet to centralized locations for ingest into OTT / CDN and other distribution systems. Yet another is a new highly cost-effective bulk IP to IP digital video Transcoder that supports 24 channels of format and rate conversion in a single Rack Unit (1RU) size and corrects digital television compatibility issues. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The QPSK and 8PSK to QAM transcoders (QTM Series) are used for economically deploying or adding a satellite-based tier of digital or HDTV digital programming. The units transcode a satellite signal’s modulation from QPSK to QAM or from 8PSK modulation format to QAM format. Since QPSK and 8PSK are optimum for satellite transmission and QAM is optimum for fiber/coax distribution, precious system bandwidth is saved while the signal retains its digital information.



Encoders accept various input sources (analog and/or digital) and output digitally encoded 4K, UHD, HD or SD video in various output formats such as IP, QAM modulated, or Asynchronous Serial Interface (“ASI”). ASI is a streaming data format which carries the MPEG-2 Transport Stream. The IP output format allows operators to stream video over private data networks with greater reliability and content security. The QAM outputs can be used for digital video distribution over typical coax and HFC networks to serve a variety of Telecom environments (i.e. CO’s, headends, stadiums, broadcast and cable television studios, hospitals, university campuses, etc.). As a complement to this encoder line, Blonder Tongue also provides digital QAM multiplexers which take multiple inputs (ASI or 8VSB/QAM) and delivers a single multiplexed QAM output, thereby optimizing the HD channel lineup by preserving bandwidth. The Company’s QAM output MPEG encoders support low latency and superior motion optimization for content such as fast-paced sporting events, which is ideal for live events within a stadium or arena. The Company’s new Clearview transcoder product line supports high density highly cost-effective bulk re-encoding functions to support a wide range of service operator use-cases such as creating digital television universal reception of signals, professional Dolby® audio encoding and format conversions, or conversion of broadcast to IPTV expected video formats. The Company’s Encoder/Transcoder Products accounted for approximately 50% and 26% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall increase of $3,618,000 year-over-year.




● | NXG IP Digital Video Processing and Headend Products were introduced by the Company in 2018 and were a culmination of the Company’s product development efforts of an advanced next-generation-enterprise series of products and solutions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The NXG is a powerful, two-way, forward-looking digital video signal processing platform and series of modular add-on products that are ideal for delivering the next generation of entertainment services for residential and enterprise applications, including IPTV format conversions and simulcast use cases and is actively deployed in education, MDU, healthcare, business parks, campuses, institutions, hospitality, cruise ships, professional sports stadiums and government facilities. The goals of the NXG product line is to addresses the service provider challenges of (a) migrating from traditional CATV transmission, such as fiber and coaxial cable, to fully IP-based transmission and delivery, and (b) migrating from traditional content protection, such as Commscope/Arris DigiCipher®, Cisco PowerKEY®, Verimatrix® CAS, and LG Pro:Idiom®, to IP-based digital rights management (“IP-DRM”) - content protection systems of the future, such as Adobe DRM®, Verimatrix-M®, Google Widevine®, PlayReady®, and Zenith/LG IP Pro:Idiom® technologies. In order to accomplish those goals, NXG was designed to be an anything-in to anything-out solution. Based on key customer guidance and the Company’s research and development effort, NXG is a 100% fully modular, passive-back-plane-based product that enables the service providers to (a) easily and seamlessly accomplish the migration described in the forgoing, and (b) cost effectively and seamlessly address what may become any future, unforeseen, prospective transmission, and content protection migrations. Unlike many competing products, in NXG, all “active” electronic components reside in their respective modules. There are no active components in either the rack-chassis or backplane which brings the benefits of ultra-high reliability, flexibility and future adaptability to as yet unknown use-cases. In addition, the Company’s plan is for the functionality of all of the standalone key signal processing products described in both the foregoing and following paragraphs are to be, over time, migrated and subsumed as modular optional features supported by the NXG product line. In 2021 the Company released and began producing the NXG Edge version of the NXG product line to target lower-functionality and lower-cost advanced encryption edge QAM types of use cases. The Company’s NXG Products accounted for approximately 12% and 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall increase of $1,219,000 year-over-year.

● | Coax Distribution Products are used to transport signals from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home, apartment unit, hotel room, office or other end-point location along a coax distribution network. Among the products offered by the Company in this category are broadband amplifiers, directional taps, splitters and wall outlets. In cable television systems, the coax distribution products are either mounted on exterior utility poles or encased in pedestals, vaults or other security devices. In SMB systems the distribution system is typically enclosed within the walls of the building (if a single structure) or added to an existing structure using various techniques to hide the coax cable and devices. The non-passive devices within this category are designed to ensure that the signal distributed from the headend is of sufficient strength when it arrives at its final destination to provide high quality audio/video images. The Company’s Coax Distribution Products accounted for approximately 8% and 10% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall decrease of $337,000 year-over-year.

● | Digital Modulation Products are used by a system operator for acquisition, processing, compression, and management of digital video. The headend is the center of a digital television system. It is the central location where multiple programs are received and, through additional processing, allocated to specific channels for digital distribution. Blonder Tongue continues to expand its Digital Modulation Product offerings to meet the evolving needs of its customers, which is expected to continue for years to come. IP interfaces have been added to a wide range of products to help in the migration to IPTV. One such example is the AQT8-B, a multichannel 8VSB/QAM-IP transmodulator that receives up to 64 programs of off-air broadcast signals over 8 different frequencies and transmodulates them for output on both coax and IP distribution networks. Other lines of digital products provided by Blonder Tongue and Drake include our Edge QAM devices, Satellite Quadrature Phase Shift Key (“QPSK”) and Eight Phase Shift Key (“8PSK”) to QAM transmodulators. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company’s Aircastertm ATSC, QAM, and IP trans-modulator series of products (“AQT8”) allow the user to create a customized line up from off-air and/or cable feeds for coax IP distribution. The customizable IP output contains multiple programs with a combination of single and multiple transport streams, from multiple RF input sources. The unique MPEG-2 transport systems information tables associated with each of the selected input programs are transferred to the IP outputs. This means the virtual channel numbers and program names on the IP outputs can be the same as their RF program input sources. The Company’s AQT8 products enable the user to modify the metadata, including PSIP parameters, such as the Program ID, Program #, Short Name, Major Ch., and Minor Ch. Information, to provide a customized IP program delivery solution. The Aircaster AQT8 features Emergency Alert System (“EAS”) program switching through either an ASI or IP format EAS input and terminal block contacts for triggering.



Stand-alone Edge QAM devices accept Ethernet input and capture MPEG over IP transport streams, decrypt service provider conditional access or content protection, and insert proprietary conditional access, such as Pro:Idiom, into the stream. These streams are then combined and modulated on to QAM RF carriers, in most cases providing multiple streams on to one 6 MHz digital channel. Inputs to Edge QAM devices can come from satellite receivers, set-top boxes, network devices or video servers. The use of these devices adds flexibility for the service provider, in part, because all of this routing happens in one device. Scaling is accomplished via software and modules embedded inside the hardware. Since it is a true network device, the Edge QAM can be managed over a traditional Ethernet network or over the Internet.



Digital Modulation Product use continues in all of the Company’s primary markets, bringing more advanced technology to consumers and operators. The Company’s Digital Video Headend Products accounted for approximately 6% of the Company’s revenues in both 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall increase of $25,000 year-over-year.




● | DOCSIS Data Products give service providers, integrators, and premise owners a means to deliver data, video, and voice-over-coaxial in locations such as hotels and hospitality, MDU’s, and college campuses using IP technology. Among the products offered by the Company are CMTS and cable modems (“CM”). The Company’s DOCSIS Data Products accounted for approximately 5% and 13% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall decrease of $1,429,000 year-over-year.

● | SLA and Services includes Service Level Agreements (“SLA”), installation and support services, contracts on equipment advanced replacement, hands-on customer and end-user training, system design engineering, on-site field support, remote support, troubleshooting and complete system verification testing. These SLA and Services also include after hour and 24x7x365 support contracts. The Company began programs in 2020 and expanded in 2021 to promote and emphasize the value of services and agreements for services offering a range of service levels tailored to various customer’s business needs. The Company’s SLA and Services products accounted for approximately 3% and 1% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, with an overall increase of $279,000 year-over-year.

Miscellaneous products and services, filling customers’ needs for receiving off-air broadcast television and satellite transmissions prior to headend processing, satellite distribution, repair, and parts.



The Company will modify its products to meet specific customer requirements. Typically, these modifications are minor and do not materially alter either the product functionality or the ability to sell such altered products to other customers.



Research and Product Development



The markets served by Blonder Tongue are characterized by technological change, new product introductions, and evolving industry standards. To compete effectively in this environment, the Company must engage in ongoing research and development in order to (i) create new products, (ii) expand features of existing products to accommodate customer demand for greater capability, (iii) license new technologies, (iv) acquire products incorporating technology that could not otherwise be developed quickly enough using internal resources and (v) acquire complementary products incorporating technology from third parties allowing internal resources to focus on higher-value strategic areas of research and development. Research and development projects are often initially undertaken at the request of or in an effort to address the particular needs of the Company’s customers and customer prospects, with the expectation or promise of substantial future orders. Projects may also result from new technologies that become available, or new market applications of existing technology. In the new product development process, the vast experience of the Company’s engineering group is leveraged to ensure the highest level of suitability and widest acceptance in the marketplace. Products tend to be developed in a functional building block approach that allows for different combinations of blocks to generate new relevant products. Additional research and development efforts are also continuously underway for the purpose of enhancing product quality and lowering production costs. This building block philosophy of research and development was expanded on in the fourth quarter of 2018 with several new hardware designs each yielding a wide range of product derivative models based on a single common design, yielding the Company improved engineering cost efficiencies. For the acquisition of new technologies, the Company may rely upon technology licenses from third parties or customized derivative product development. The Company will also license technology if it can obtain technology more quickly, or more cost-effectively from third parties than it could otherwise develop on its own, or if the desired technology is proprietary to a third party. There were 16 employees involved in the technical product definition, technology systems architecture and research and development departments of the Company at December 31, 2021, distributed among the Company’s operating locations.

Marketing and Sales 



Blonder Tongue markets and sells its products for use in a wide range of IPTV and other Telecom and SMB markets, including with municipal fiber optic operators, traditional cable television, telco, MDU, lodging/hospitality, and institutional settings (schools, hospitals and prisons). The Company also sells into a multitude of niche SMB markets such as sports arenas and the cruise ship industry. Sales are made directly to customers by the Company’s internal sales force, as well as through Blonder Tongue Premier Distributors. The Company instituted its Premier Distributor Program in 2007, through which a limited group of larger distributors who stock a significant amount of the Company’s products in their inventory are given access to a special purchase incentive program allowing them to achieve volume price concessions measured on a year-to-year basis. Sales to the Company’s Premier Distributors accounted for approximately 27% and 26% of the Company’s revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively. These Premier Distributors serve multiple markets. Direct sales to telco operators, municipal fiber operators, cable operators and system integrators accounted for approximately 39% and 40% of the Company’s revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively.



The Company’s sales and marketing function is performed by its internal sales and marketing associates working in partnership and conjunction its Premier Distributors, as well as its smaller company integrator and distributor network. Should it be deemed necessary, the Company may retain independent sales representatives in particular geographic areas or targeted to specific customer prospects or target market opportunities. Sales and marketing make up 16% of the Company’s overall workforce, divided into central and regional coverage in Old Bridge, New Jersey, in Ohio and Florida, as well as .Pennsylvania, the Chicago and Atlanta areas.



The Company’s standard customer payment terms are net 30 days. From time to time, when circumstances warrant, such as a commitment to a large blanket purchase order, the Company will selectively extend payment terms beyond its standard payment terms to 60 days.



The Company has several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of its products. Blonder Tongue participates in industry trade shows and conferences and also maintains a robust website and direct on-line sales portal. The Company publishes technical articles in trade and technical journals, distributes sales and product literature and has an active public relations plan to ensure complete coverage of Blonder Tongue’s products and technology by editors of trade journals. The Company provides system design engineering services for its customers, maintains extensive ongoing communications with many original equipment manufacturer customers and provides one-on-one demonstrations and technical seminars to potential new customers. Blonder Tongue supplies sales and applications support, product literature and training to its sales representatives and distributors. Before the COVID pandemic began in March of 2020, the management and sales staff of the Company traveled extensively, identifying customer needs and meeting existing and potential customers. The Company anticipates resuming these activities at pre-pandemic levels as U.S. CDC guidelines allow.



Customers 



Blonder Tongue has a diverse customer base, which in 2021 consisted of approximately 113 active accounts. Approximately 58% and 37% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were derived from sales of products to the Company’s five largest customers. Stellar Private Cable, Advanced Media Technologies and North American Cable Equipment accounted for approximately 20%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s revenues in 2021. No customers accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenues in 2020. None of these customers are obligated to purchase a material amount of products or to provide the Company with a material level of binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period. There can be no assurance that sales to these entities, individually or as a group, will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period; however, the Company currently anticipates that the three customers mentioned above. will continue to account for a significant portion of the Company’s revenues in future periods. See disclosure below in “Risk Factors – Any substantial decrease in sales to our largest customers may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition” for further details.



Since 2010, the Company has held multi-year contracts with key distributors in its Premier Distributor Program. Many of the Company’s smaller business customers, with whom the Company had formerly dealt on a direct basis, now purchase the Company’s products from our Premier Distributors.

In the Company’s direct sales to system integrators, the complement of our significant customers tends to vary over time as the most efficient and better financed integrators grow more rapidly than others. Any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of the Company’s significant customers, the financial failure of any of these entities, or the Company’s inability to develop and maintain solid relationships with the integrators that may replace the present significant customers, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.



The Company’s revenues are derived primarily from customers in the continental United States; however, the Company also derives some revenues from customers in other geographical markets, primarily Canada and to a much more limited extent, in developing countries. Sales to customers outside of the United States represented approximately 4% and 3% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. All of the Company’s transactions with customers located outside of the United States have historically been denominated in U.S. dollars. As such, the Company has had no foreign currency transactions from which it derives revenues. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies have certain inherent risks associated with them due to currency fluctuations. See “Risk Factors” below for more detail on the risks associated with foreign currency transactions.



Manufacturing and Suppliers



Blonder Tongue’s primary manufacturing operations are presently located at the Old Bridge, New Jersey Facility, which also serves as the Company’s headquarters. The Company has developed, implemented and maintains a Quality Management System, that has been certified as conforming to all requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 international standard. The Company recently completed an audit and renewed its ISO 9001:2015 certification in December 2021. The Company’s manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and consist principally of the programming, assembly, and testing of electronic assemblies built from fabricated parts, printed circuit boards and electronic devices and the fabrication from raw sheet metal, of chassis and cabinets for such assemblies. Management continues to implement improvements to the manufacturing process to increase production volume and reduce product cost, including logistics modifications on the factory floor to accommodate increasingly fine pitch surface mount electronic components. The Company is capable of manufacturing assemblies of 16-layer printed circuit boards with thousands of components, including placement of 0.030x0.030mil ball grid arrays and 0201 packaged sized components, utilizing its advanced state-of-the-art automatic placement equipment as well as automated optical inspection and testing systems. Investments by the Company in these advanced manufacturing technologies is consistent with and part of the Company’s strategy to provide its customers with high performance-to-cost ratio products. The Company also maintains engineering and technical support staff in Ohio, Ft. Wayne, Indiana, Florida and in the Atlanta, GA area.



Since 2007, the Company has been manufacturing certain high volume, labor intensive products, including a portion of the Company’s analog products overseas in the PRC, and since 2019 in Korea and Taiwan. A key contract manufacturer in the PRC produces a portion of these products (all of which are proprietary Blonder Tongue designs) as may be requested by the Company from time to time (in the Company’s discretion) through the submission of purchase orders, the terms of which are governed by a manufacturing agreement. Although the Company does not currently anticipate the transfer of any additional products to overseas companies for manufacture, the Company may do so if business and market conditions make it advantageous to do so. In connection with the Company’s initiatives in Korea, Taiwan and the PRC, the Company may have limited foreign currency transactions and may be subject to limited various currency exchange control programs related to its overseas operations.



Outside contractors supply standard components, printed circuit boards and electronic subassemblies to the Company’s specifications. The Company purchases electronic parts that it classifies into three groups: (i) products which do not have a unique source, (ii) products that have a limited number of suppliers and (iii) products which have a sole source. Products which do not have a unique source are generally available with limited supply disruptions. Products that are available from a limited number of suppliers may be subject to temporary shortages because of general economic conditions and the demand and supply for such component parts. Products which have a sole source are subject to longer term shortages and in some cases not available at all in the short term, with certain deliveries not expected until 2023. If the Company were to experience a temporary shortage of any given electronic part, the Company believes that alternative parts could be obtained, or system design changes implemented. There can be no assurances that obtaining alternative parts or system design changes can be done successfully or on a cost-effective basis. An inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of certain of these components could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results. The Company does not have an agreement with any sole source supplier requiring the supplier to sell a specified volume of components to the Company. See “Risk Factors” below for more detail on the risk associated with sole supplier products.

Blonder Tongue maintains a quality assurance program which monitors and controls manufacturing processes, and extensively tests samples throughout the process. Samples of component parts purchased are tested, as well as its finished products, on an ongoing basis. The Company also tests component and sub-assemblies throughout the manufacturing process using commercially available and in-house built testing systems that incorporate proprietary procedures. The highest level of quality assurance is maintained throughout all aspects of the design and manufacturing process. The extensive in-house calibration program assures test equipment integrity, correlation and calibration. This program ensures that all test and measurement equipment that is used in the manufacturing process is calibrated to the same in-house reference standard on a consistent basis. When all test and measurement devices are calibrated in this manner, discrepancies are eliminated between the engineering, manufacturing and quality control departments, thus increasing operational efficiency and ensuring a high level of product quality. Blonder Tongue performs final product tests prior to shipment to customers. In 2008, the Company was certified to perform Underwriters Laboratories (UL) witness testing of products to UL International Standard 60950.



Competition



All aspects of the Company’s business are highly competitive. The Company competes with international, national, regional and local manufacturers and distributors, including companies larger than Blonder Tongue that have substantially greater resources. A small subset of manufacturers who are suppliers to the Company sell directly as well as through distributors into the franchise and private cable marketplaces. Because of the convergence of the cable, telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological developments, new competitors may seek to enter the principal markets served by the Company. Many of these potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and other resources than Blonder Tongue. The Company expects that direct and indirect competition may increase in the future. Additional competition could result in price reductions, loss of market share and delays in the timing of customer orders. The principal methods of competition are product differentiation, product reputation, performance, quality, price, terms, service, technical support and administrative support. The Company is a major competitor in many of the markets that it serves and differentiates itself from other companies by consistently offering innovative products, providing excellent technical service support and delivering extremely high reliability products and high performance-to-cost ratio (high value) products.
Intellectual Property



The Company currently holds several United States and foreign patents, including certain technologies within the NXG platform and certain technologies within its DOCSIS data products. No other patents are considered material to the Company’s present operations, since they do not relate to high volume applications. Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the telecommunications and cable television industry, the Company believes that its market position as a technology supplier derives primarily from its ability to timely develop a consistent stream of new products that are designed to meet its customers’ needs and that have a high performance-to-cost ratio.



The Company owns a United States trademark registration for the word mark “Blonder Tongue®” and “Aircaster®” and also on a “BT®” logo. Drake owns a United States trademark registration for the word mark “DRAKE®”.



Since 2008, the Company has obtained and renewed licenses for a variety of technologies in concert with its digital encoder line of products. The licenses are from a number of companies including from Zenith, a subsidiary of LG Electronics (expires December 2022). These standard licenses are all non-exclusive and many require payment of royalties based upon the unit sales of the licensed products. With regard to the licenses expiring in 2022, the Company expects to renew these standard licenses on similar terms to those presently in force. For additional information regarding these licenses, see “Introduction” starting on page 1.



The Company relies on a combination of patents, contractual rights and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technologies and know-how. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to protect its technologies and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know-how independently. Therefore, existing and potential competitors may be able to develop products that are competitive with the Company’s products and such competition could adversely affect the prices for the Company’s products or the Company’s market share. The Company also believes that factors such as the technological and creative skills of its personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining its competitive position. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to constant development of new technologies and evolution of existing technologies, many of which are the subject of existing third-party patents and new patents are issued frequently.

Regulation



Private cable, while in some cases subject to certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licensing requirements, is not presently burdened with extensive government regulations. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated many aspects of franchise cable system operation and opened the door to competition among cable operators and telephone companies in each of their respective industries.
Environmental Regulations



The Company is subject to a variety of Federal, State and local governmental regulations related to the storage, use, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals if and when used in its manufacturing processes. The Company did not incur in 2021 and does not anticipate incurring in 2022, material capital expenditures for compliance with Federal, State and local environmental laws and regulations. There can be no assurance, however, that changes in environmental regulations will not result in the need for additional capital expenditures or otherwise impose additional financial burdens on the Company. Further, such regulations could restrict the Company’s ability to expand its operations. Any failure by the Company to obtain required permits for, control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject the Company to substantial liability or could cause its manufacturing operations to be suspended.



The Company has authorization to discharge wastewater under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System/Discharge to Surface Waters General Industrial Stormwater Permit, Permit No. NJ0088315. This permit will expire May 31, 2022 and is automatically renewed upon payment of the annual fee. The Company intends to renew this permit.



Employees



As of February 28, 2022, the Company employed approximately 84 people, including 39 in manufacturing, 14 in research and development, 3 in quality assurance, 19 in sales and marketing, and 9 in a general and administrative capacity. Substantially all of these employees are full time employees. Twenty-one of the Company’s employees are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, Local 2066, which has a labor agreement with the Company that is scheduled to expire in February 2023.
