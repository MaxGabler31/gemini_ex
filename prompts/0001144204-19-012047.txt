ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History
 
EFT Holdings, Inc. (formerly EFT Biotech Holdings, Inc., HumWare Media Corporation, GRG, Inc., Ghiglieri Corporation and Karat Productions, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 1992. Since our acquisition of EFT Biotech, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“EFT Biotech”), in November 2007, we have followed the same course of business as we do today, that is, the sale of nutritional, personal care, automotive, house care and other products outside of the United States, primarily in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“Hong Kong” herein) and People’s Republic of China (“China” herein).
Background
 
Through our website, www.eftb.us, we sell substantially all of our products in Hong Kong and China to customers who are the end users of our products, to whom we refer as “Affiliates”, located in those jurisdictions. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference herein. No sales of our products are made in the United States. Our company is a holding company and we conduct our business through our subsidiaries and, unless otherwise noted, any reference to our operations includes the operations of our subsidiaries.
 
Our corporate structure is depicted in the diagram set forth below.

Trends and Developments
 
Sales Declines. Since 2012, our sales revenues have declined from year to year, from $13,536,120 for 2012 to $250,840 for 2017. This long-term decline is attributable, primarily, to unjustified actions taken and slanderous statements made by certain third parties in China that damaged our established goodwill within our network of established Affiliates. We have been unable to seek redress against these persons, due to their being denizens of China.
 
Impairment of Land and Building. At March 31, 2017, we determined that the fair value of our building in Taipei, Taiwan, had decreased significantly, due to weakness in the Taiwanese real estate market. In accordance with such determination, an asset impairment loss of $5,615,398 was recorded for the year ended March 31, 2017.
 
Impairment of Water Plant. At March 31, 2017, we had determined that the fair value of our water plant in Heilongjiang Province, China, had decreased significantly. In accordance with such determination, an asset impairment loss of $634,969 was recorded for Fiscal 2017. No similar item was recorded during Fiscal 2016.
Beverage Segment. By the end of 2012, through our subsidiary, Heilongjiang Tianquan Manor Soda Water Ltd. (“Tianquan Soda Water”), we had completed construction of a production facility to produce bottled natural soda water in Baiquan, Heilongjiang Province, China. Production of our bottled water product began in April 2013, but, shortly thereafter, production was suspended indefinitely, due to issues with the production facility and the institution of a lawsuit against Tianquan Soda Water by a contractor involved in the construction of the production facility.
 
During the last quarter of Fiscal 2017, our management determined not to re-start bottling operations at the Tianquan Soda Water production facility and our management has begun to take actions necessary for the sale of the Tianquan Soda Water production facility. No prediction can be made regarding the timing of the sale of the plant or if any such sale will ever occur.
 
Management’s Ongoing Analysis. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2017, our management began an analysis of several business options that could allow our company to re-establish itself as a respected sales organization in the China market. This analysis process is ongoing and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Our Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses
 
We believe our company has the following competitive strengths:
 
• our lines of excellent products;
 • our sales and marketing contacts in Hong Kong SAR, China and other countries in the region; and
 • our low overhead.
 
We believe our company has the following competitive weaknesses:
 
• our once-excellent good will with our Affiliates has suffered severely in the wake of injurious actions taken and erroneous statements made by certain third parties;
 • the process of re-establishing our good will is difficult; and
 •          our lack of capital.
 
Products
 
Online Segment.
 
Nutritional. Our nutritional products are non-pharmaceutical nutritional products. They are ingestible through oral liquids, oral sprays, tablets and/or tea. Our oral sprays are delivered through very fine mist sprayed directly into the mouth. Our containers used to deliver our nutritional products are small, compact and easy to carry.
 
Each of our nutritional products is all natural, made from pure ingredients and designed to address specific objectives of the user. Each nutritional product has been formulated to address a specific need, symptom and/or condition. We make no claims as to the products’ curing any medical condition or preventing any medical ailment. Our nutritional products have not been tested nor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as is the case with all non-prescription products.

Beverage Segment.
 
Bottled Water. By the end of 2012, through our subsidiary, Tianquan Soda Water, we had completed construction of a production facility to produce bottled natural soda water in Baiquan, Heilongjiang Province, China. Production of our bottled water product began in April 2013, but, shortly thereafter, production was suspended indefinitely, due to issues with the production facility and the institution of a lawsuit against Tianquan Soda Water by a contractor involved in the construction of the production facility.
 
During the last quarter of Fiscal 2017, our management determined not to re-start bottling operations at the Tianquan Soda Water production facility and our management has begun to take actions necessary for the sale of the Tianquan Soda Water production facility. No prediction can be made regarding the timing of the sale of the plant or if any such sale will ever occur.
 
Additional Product Information. We do not have a return policy and we do not offer refunds. However, we do provide a limited warranty for our products. The specific warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold, but, generally, include replacement of defective products during the six-month period following a sale. Historically, our warranty expenses have not been material.
Manufacturing
 
Nutritional, Personal Care, Automotive Care and House Care Products (Online Segment). Our nutritional, personal care, automotive care and house care products are manufactured and packaged under our brands by third parties located in the United States. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or product supply agreements with any of our manufacturers. Rather, we engage these manufacturers only on short-term, oral agreements. Our management believes that our operating under oral agreements with our manufactures does not present undue risk to our company, as compared to a circumstance in which we engaged our manufacturers by written agreements.
 
We order our products directly from manufacturers on an “as needed” or “expected need” basis. Raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are readily available and are not in short supply. Further, we are not a party to any agreement for the purchase or delivery of raw materials.
 
None of our manufacturers accounts for a significant portion of our business and any one of these manufacturers could be replaced on short notice, should such an action be required.
 
Bottled Soda Water Product (Beverage Segment). By the end of 2012, through our subsidiary, Tianquan Soda Water, we had completed construction of a production facility to produce bottled natural soda water in Baiquan, Heilongjiang Province, China. Production of our bottled water product began in April 2013, but, shortly thereafter, production was suspended indefinitely, due to issues with the production facility and the institution of a lawsuit against Tianquan Soda Water by a contractor involved in the construction of the production facility.
 
During the last quarter of Fiscal 2017, our management determined not to re-start bottling operations at the Tianquan Soda Water production facility and our management has begun to take actions necessary for the sale of the Tianquan Soda Water production facility. No prediction can be made regarding the timing of the sale of the plant or if any such sale will ever occur.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
Sales. Historically, substantially all of our sales have been made in Hong Kong and China. We are currently attempting to reverse a six-year decline in sales caused by actions of certain third parties located in China. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2017, our management began an analysis of several business options that could allow our company to re-establish itself as a respected sales organization in the China market. This analysis process is expected to be completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.

However, we have begun to implement initial strategies for re-establishing our sales volumes. These efforts are focused on internet marketing strategies that target customers in Hong Kong and China, the markets in which we believe our line of products enjoys the greatest acceptance. In conjunction with these internet marketing strategies, we are attempting to revive our once-vibrant word-of-mouth customer referral system.
 
We sell our line of products exclusively through our website, www.eftb.us, to our Affiliates, who are our customers, or the end users of our products. We do not make sales of any of our products in the United States.
 
We distinguish between first-time customers and Affiliates, inasmuch as Affiliates are paid commissions for referrals of new customers. To become an Affiliate, a customer must be referred by another Affiliate and make an initial minimum purchase of $450, including shipping and handling charges. Affiliates are not required to make any purchases beyond their initial purchases, nor are Affiliates required to pay membership fees, resell products, recruit new customers or attend any Affiliate meetings. In Hong Kong and China, we offer our Affiliates free educational classes that offer further information concerning our products and new and interesting ways of using our products.
 
During the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we received 178 and 183 orders, respectively, and, as of March 31, 2017, we had received a total of 1,259,185 orders, from our Affiliates, and no Affiliate accounted for a significant portion of our sales volume.
 
We pay Affiliates a commission on products ordered from us by new customers and Affiliates attributable to them. The commission we pay is equal to approximately 58% of the total dollar amount of each order. We account for these commissions as a reduction of the sales price of our products and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as such. All commissions earned by Affiliates are held by us in book entry form. Affiliates are able to apply their respective commissions to pay for their new orders of products. By employing this commission system, our management believes that we achieve a reduction in operating expense and eliminate cumbersome accounting procedures, such as issuing checks and reconciling bank statements.
 
Distribution. Once full payment in U.S. Dollars for an order is received, the ordered products are shipped directly from one of our distribution centers located in either Hong Kong or China to the party who placed the order.
Insurance
 
We maintain such insurance policies as our management deems appropriate, given the current level of operations of our company.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, including packaging and label design, business know-how, including product delivery systems (spray), and product formulations as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our products. Our policy is to establish, enforce and protect our intellectual property rights using the intellectual property laws.
 
We use the “EFT” name, a trademark owned and licensed to us by EFT Assets Limited (“EFT Assets”). EFT Assets is owned by Wendy Qin, who served as a director of one of our subsidiaries, EFT International Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation, until March 2015. Ms. Qin is the sister of our President, Jack Jie Qin. Under the agreement with EFT Assets, as renewed effective April 1, 2017, we are required to pay a minimum annual royalty to EFT Assets of $500,000 for the first year of the renewed agreement, and a minimum annual royalty to EFT Assets of $200,000 for each of the remaining nine years of the term of the agreement. The required annual royalty payment increases, should we obtain certain levels of gross sales, as follows: 5% of the first $30 million of gross sales; 4% of the $10 million of gross sales in excess of $30 million; 3% of the $10 million of gross sales in excess of $40 million; 2% of the $10 million of gross sales in excess of $50 million; and 1% of the $10 million of gross sales in excess of $60 million. For each of the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we were obligated to pay EFT Assets the amount of $500,000 as a royalty. However, we have not paid such royalties in full, and the unpaid amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements.
 
We do not currently hold any patents, registered trademarks or copyrights.

Government Regulation
 
We do not make sales of products in the United States and are not subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 Further, government approval is not currently necessary for the sale of any of our products and the marketing and sale of our products are not subject to governmental regulation in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Research and Development
 
We have not and do not engage in any research and development activities, nor do we contemplate spending any material amount on such activities in the foreseeable future.
Seasonality
 
Our business is not seasonal in nature.
 
Employees
 
Currently, we have three full-time employees at our executive offices in City of Industry, California, two full and part-time employees at our Kowloon, Hong Kong, office, no full and part-time employees at our Taipei, Taiwan, office, and no employees at our Tianquan Soda Water production facility. We adjust the number of employees from time to time, in accordance with the demands of our business.
 
None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations to be good.
