Overview of Our Business
 
We are engaged in the business of providing consulting services and education for blockchain technology and for the building of technological infrastructure and enterprise blockchain technology solutions. During 2021 we generated revenues and incurred expenses solely through these consulting operations. In February 2022 we acquired bitcoin mining equipment and entered into an arrangement with a third party to host and operate the equipment. The mining equipment will mine bitcoin and the Company expects to monetize the bitcoin mined from its equipment starting in the first quarter of 2022.
Strategic Acquisitions
 
In furtherance of the development of our blockchain consulting services, we may seek from time to time additional strategic acquisitions of assets and / or majority and minority equity interests in entities and technology with characteristics such as (i) established, protectable and scalable revenues; (ii) substantial market share; (iii) established brand equity and customer loyalty; (iv) proprietary technology with competitive advantages; (v) quality personnel, and (vi) strategic access to international markets. Similarly, we may seek to acquire additional assets that complement our business or otherwise enter into strategic relationships as a means to grow our business operations and revenues.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our service marks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our products and services. Our policy is to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks.
Market Overview
 
Blockchain
 
The blockchain is a decentralized database or digital “ledger” of transactions across a peer-to-peer network of computers or “nodes” that use the underlying infrastructure of the Internet to validate and process valuable transactions. While using the blockchain, participants can transfer information across the Internet without the need of a central third party. In a financial transaction, the buyer and seller interact directly without the need for verification by a trusted third-party intermediary. The actual record of the transaction is pseudonymous, but the identifying information is encrypted, preventing personal information from being shared.
 
The benefits of blockchain include the following:
 

● | Fraud reduction: Blockchain technology has the potential to positively disrupt most industries since it can work for nearly every type of transaction that involves value, including money, property, and goods. From a business perspective, the technology may be leveraged for process improvement, helping to reduce human error, prevent fraud, and streamline data storage. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Transparency: Financial organizations may use the blockchain to store records digitally and leverage the technology for any type of transaction that needs to be verified by a trusted third party. 
● | Security: Transactions may include transferring digital or physical assets, verifying chain of custody, and protecting intellectual property. In an era with increasing cybercrime and strict regulatory requirements, blockchain offers a highly fraud-resistant technology that can protect and authenticate almost any type of transaction. 
● | Efficiency: Both Permissioned and Public blockchains offer significant improvements in efficiency to retail and business implementations by reducing cost and time in the duplicate databases and ledgers that companies and intermediaries must maintain in the absence of a shared, trusted and immutable system.

Competition
 
We have a number of competitors, ranging in size, consisting primarily of other similar consulting firms. We believe our main competitors are ConsenSys, Natsoft Corporation, Quest Global Technologies, and CGI Inc. In addition, global audit and assurance firms typically provide consulting services. Additionally, there are numerous additional other companies that indirectly compete with us in the educational space.
Governmental Regulations
 
Various uses of blockchain technology are subject to regulation by various governmental entities such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission (“CFTC”), Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) and governmental bodies in other countries. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain business (NASDAQ, NYSE, FINRA, state securities commissions).
 
Blockchain aimed regulations are evolving with agencies investigating businesses and their practices, gathering information, and generally trying to understand the risks and uncertainties in order to protect investors in these businesses. Regulations will likely increase, in many cases, although it is presently not possible to know how they will increase, how regulations will apply to the Company’s businesses, or when they will be effective. Various bills have also been proposed in congress for adoption-related to the Company’s business which may be adopted and have an impact on it. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, the Company may become subject to new laws and further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, although the Company is not currently trading in digital assets and has no intention to trade in digital assets.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 10 full-time employees. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
