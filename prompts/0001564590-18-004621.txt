Merger of Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.
 On January 4, 2018, Inotek Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“Inotek”) and privately held Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (“Private Rocket”) completed a business combination in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of September 12, 2017, by and among Inotek, Rome Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Inotek (“Merger Sub”), and Private Rocket, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Rocket, with Private Rocket surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Inotek. This transaction is referred to as the “Reverse Merger.” Immediately following the Reverse Merger, Inotek changed its name to “Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” In connection with the closing of the Reverse Merger, our common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol “RCKT” on January 5, 2018.
 The Reverse Merger will be accounted for as a reverse merger under the acquisition method of accounting. After reviewing the relative voting rights, the composition of the board of directors and the composition of senior management of the combined company after the Reverse Merger, it was determined that Private Rocket will be treated as the accounting acquirer and Inotek will be treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes under the acquisition method of accounting.
 Overview
 Prior to the Reverse Merger, Inotek was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for ocular diseases, including glaucoma. After failing to meet the primary endpoints in its first pivotal Phase 3 trial of trabodenoson monotherapy (“MATrX-1”) and its Phase 2 trial of trabodenoson in a fixed-dose combination therapy with latanoprost (“FDC”), Inotek voluntarily discontinued its development of trabodenoson in 2017. 
 Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “Rocket”), is a multi-platform biotechnology company focused on the development of first-in-class gene therapies for rare and devastating pediatric diseases. Rocket has two lentiviral vector (“LVV”) programs currently undergoing clinical testing targeting Fanconi Anemia (“FA”), a genetic defect in the bone marrow that reduces production of blood cells or promotes the production of faulty blood cells, and three additional LVV programs targeting other rare genetic diseases. In addition, Rocket has an adeno-associated viral vector (“AAV”) program for which it expects to file an investigational new drug (“IND”) application in the next 12 months, which will permit the commencement of human clinical studies thereafter. Rocket has full global commercialization and development rights to all of its product candidates under royalty-bearing license agreements, with the exception of the CRISPR/Cas9 development program (described below) for which Rocket currently has only development rights.
 Rocket’s two leading LVV and AAV technology platforms are each being designed in collaboration with leading academic and industry partners. Through its gene therapy platforms, Rocket aims to restore normal cellular function by modifying the defective genes that cause each of the targeted disorders.
 Gene Therapy Overview
 Genes are composed of sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”), which code for proteins that perform a broad range of physiologic functions in all living organisms. Although genes are passed on from generation to generation, genetic changes, also known as mutations, can occur in this process. These changes can result in the lack of production of proteins or the production of altered proteins with reduced or abnormal function, which can in turn result in disease.
 Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach in which an isolated gene sequence or segment of DNA is administered to a patient, most commonly for the purpose of treating a genetic disease that is caused by genetic mutations. Currently available therapies for many genetic diseases focus on administration of large proteins or enzymes and typically address only the symptoms of the disease. Gene therapy aims to address the disease-causing effects of absent or dysfunctional genes by delivering functional copies of the gene sequence directly into the patient’s cells, offering the potential for curing the genetic disease, rather than simply addressing symptoms.
 For the development of Rocket’s gene therapy treatments, Rocket is using a modified non-pathogenic virus. Viruses are particularly well suited as delivery vehicles, because they are adept at penetrating cells and delivering genetic material inside a cell. In creating Rocket’s viral delivery vehicles, the viral (pathogenic) genes are removed and are replaced with a functional form of the missing or mutant gene that is the cause of the patient’s genetic disease. The functional form of a missing or mutant gene is called a therapeutic gene, or the “transgene.” The process of inserting the transgene is called “transduction.” Once a virus is modified by replacement of the viral genes with a transgene, the modified virus is called a “viral vector.” The viral vector delivers the transgene into the targeted tissue or organ (such as the cells inside a patient’s bone marrow). Rocket has two types of viral vectors in 
 1

development, LVV and AAV. Rocket believes that its LVV and AAV-based programs have the potential to offer a significant therapeutic benefit to patients that is durable (long-lasting).
 The gene therapies can be delivered either (1) ex vivo (outside the body), in which case the patient’s cells are extracted and the vector is delivered to these cells in a controlled, safe laboratory setting, with the modified cells then being reinserted into the patient, or (2) in vivo (inside the body), in which case the vector is injected directly into the patient, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue at a targeted site, with the aim of the vector delivering the transgene to the targeted cells.
 Rocket believes that scientific advances, clinical progress, and the greater regulatory acceptance of gene therapy have created a promising environment to advance gene therapy products as these products are being designed to restore cell function and improve clinical outcomes, which in many cases include prevention of death at an early age. The recent FDA approval of Novartis’s treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) indicates that there is a regulatory pathway forward for gene therapy products.
 Pipeline Overview
 LVV Programs. Rocket’s LVV-based programs utilize third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors to target selected rare diseases. Currently, Rocket is developing LVV programs to treat FA, Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (“LAD-I”), Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (“PKD”), and Infantile Malignant Osteopetrosis (“IMO”). Brief descriptions of these conditions and the Rocket programs for each is set forth below.
Fanconi Anemia (FA)
 Rocket’s LVV-based programs utilize third-generation, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors to correct defects in patients’ hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”), which are the cells found in bone marrow that are capable of generating blood cells over a patient’s lifetime. Defects in the genetic coding of hematopoietic stem cells can result in severe, and potentially life-threatening anemia, which is when a patient’s blood lacks enough properly functioning red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body. Stem cell defects can also result in severe and potentially life-threatening decreases in white blood cells resulting in susceptibility to infections, and in platelets responsible for blood clotting, which may result in severe and potentially life-threatening bleeding episodes. Patients with FA have a genetic defect that prevents the normal repair of genes and chromosomes within blood cells in the bone marrow, which frequently results in the development of AML (acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer), as well as bone marrow failure and congenital defects. The average lifespan of an FA patient is estimated to be 30 to 40 years. The prevalence of FA in the US/EU is estimated to be about 2,000.
 Rocket currently has the following two LVV-based programs targeting FA:
 
 
• | RP-L101. RP-L101 is a program that Rocket in-licensed from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington (“Hutch”). RP-L101 is currently being studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial that is treating FA patients at Hutch under an IND sponsored by Hutch. Rocket is entitled to the data from this clinical study and has the commercial rights to the drug being studied under this IND.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RP-L102. RP-L102 is a program that Rocket in-licensed from CIEMAT (Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y Tecnológicas), which is a leading research institute in Madrid, Spain. RP-L102 is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial treating FA patients with a modified process under an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (“IMPD”) sponsored by CIEMAT. Rocket is entitled to the data from this clinical study and has the commercial rights to the drug being studied under this IMPD.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rocket expects to announce clinical data from its LVV-based programs targeting FA during the next 12 to 18 months, with the next update expected in the second quarter of 2018.  Rocket expects to advance an LVV-based program targeting FA to the pivotal trial stage in 2019.
 Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (“LAD-I”)
 LAD-I is a genetic disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, resulting in a form of immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiencies are conditions in which the immune system is unable to protect the body effectively from foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Starting from birth, people with LAD-I frequently develop serious bacterial and fungal infections. Life expectancy in individuals with LAD-I is often severely shortened. Due to repeat infections, affected individuals may not survive past infancy.
 2

Rocket currently has one LVV-based program targeting LAD-I, RP-L201. RP-L201 is a preclinical program that Rocket in-licensed from CIEMAT. This program is currently being developed through an ongoing collaboration with CIEMAT, with a rolling IMPD expected to be filed in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (“PKD”)
 PKD is an inherited lack of the enzyme “pyruvate kinase,” which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells, which in turn causes a form of anemia that can range in severity from mild (asymptomatic) to severe (resulting in childhood mortality or the requirement for frequent, lifelong blood transfusions). The pediatric population is the most commonly and severely affected subgroup of patients with PKD, and pediatric patients often undergo splenectomy (removal of the spleen) and experience jaundice and chronic iron overload.
 Rocket currently has one LVV-based program targeting PKD, RP-L301. RP-L301 is a preclinical program that Rocket in-licensed from CIEMAT. This program is currently being developed through an ongoing collaboration with CIEMAT, with a rolling IMPD expected to be filed in the next 12 months. 
 Infantile Malignant Osteopetrosis (“IMO”)
 IMO is a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density and bone mass secondary to impaired bone resorption. Osteopetrosis is a disorder of bone development in which the bones become thickened. Normally, small areas of bone are constantly being broken down by special cells called osteoclasts, then made again by cells called osteoblasts. In osteopetrosis, the cells that break down bone (osteoclasts) do not work properly, which leads to the bones becoming thicker and not as healthy. IMO is a severe form of osteopetrosis that typically presents in the first year of life and is associated with severe manifestations leading to death within the first decade of life without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”), a procedure in which a person receives blood-forming stem cells from a genetically similar, but not identical donor. For patients who do receive a bone marrow transplant, results have been limited, with frequent graft failure or rejection (graft-versus-host-disease (“GVHD”)) and other severe complications. Untreated, IMO patients may suffer from a compression of the bone-marrow space, which results in bone marrow failure, anemia and increased infection risk due to the lack of production of white blood cells. Untreated IMO patients may also suffer from a compression of cranial nerves, which transmit signals between vital organs and the brain, resulting in blindness, hearing loss and other neurologic deficits.
 Rocket currently has one LVV-based program targeting IMO, RP-L401. RP-L401 is a preclinical program that Rocket in-licensed from Lund University, Sweden. This program is currently being developed through an ongoing collaboration with Lund University, with an IMPD expected to be filed upon completion of IND/IMPD-enabling studies.
 AAV-based Program
 Rocket’s AAV-based program involves the direct injection of the viral vector into the patient, rather than modifying the patient’s cells ex-vivo. In Rocket’s preclinical studies of its AAV-based program to date, this method of therapy has displayed substantial tropism, which is the ability to hone in on the organs most afflicted by the underlying disorder, with the aim of modifying cellular function to enable the production of sufficient quantities of a missing protein to restore proper function to the afflicted cells.
 Rocket is currently developing RP-A501, which is an AAV-based program for an undisclosed rare disease. This program is currently in preclinical development, with IND-enabling studies ongoing. Rocket expects to announce preclinical data and the indication for this program in the second half of 2018 and to file an IND for this program in the next 12 months.
 CRISPR/Cas9-based program
 In addition to its LVV and AAV programs, Rocket also has a program evaluating CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing for FA. This program is currently in the discovery phase. CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing is a different method of correcting the defective genes in a patient, where the editing is very specific and targeted to a particular gene sequence. “CRISPR/Cas9” stands for Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (“CRISPR”) Associated protein-9. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used to make “cuts” in DNA at specific sites of targeted genes, making it potentially more precise in delivering gene therapies than traditional vector-based delivery approaches. CRISPR/Cas9 can also be adapted to regulate the activity of an existing gene without modifying the actual DNA sequence, which is referred to as gene regulation.
 The chart below shows the current phases of development of Rocket’s programs and product candidates:

Strategy
 Rocket seeks to bring hope and relief to patients with devastating, undertreated, rare pediatric diseases through the development and commercialization of potentially curative first-in-class gene therapies. To achieve these objectives, Rocket intends to develop into a fully-integrated biotechnology company. In the near- and medium-term, Rocket intends to develop its first-in-class product candidates, which are targeting devastating diseases with substantial unmet need. In the medium- and long-term, Rocket expects to develop proprietary in-house analytics and manufacturing capabilities, commence registration trials for its currently planned programs and submit its first biologics license applications (“BLAs”), and establish its gene therapy platform and expand its pipeline to target additional indications that Rocket believes to be potentially compatible with its gene therapy technologies. In addition, during that time, Rocket believes that its currently planned programs will become eligible for priority review vouchers from the FDA that provide for expedited review. Rocket has assembled a leadership and research team with expertise in cell and gene therapy, rare disease drug development and commercialization.
 Rocket believes that its competitive advantage lies in its disease-based selection approach, a rigorous process with defined criteria to identify target diseases. Rocket believes that this approach to asset development differentiates it as a gene therapy company and potentially provides Rocket with a first-mover advantage.
 Gene Therapy Background
 Genes are the individual protein-encoding units that are located in the chromosomes within the majority of cells that comprise living things. Genes are composed of sequences of DNA and encode for the proteins that perform a broad range of physiologic functions within living organisms. Gene mutations are abnormalities—alterations in the correct sequence of DNA molecules.
 Some diseases are known to result directly from gene mutations. Diseases that are caused by mutations in a single gene are known as monogenic diseases. Monogenic diseases are those genetic abnormalities that are the most amenable to gene therapy, since correction of the mutated gene in a sufficient cell population may result in correction of the disorder.
 Gene therapy is the use of genetic material (most frequently DNA) to treat a disorder by delivering a correct copy of a gene into a patient’s cells. The healthy, functional copy of this gene can enable the cell to function correctly. If a sufficient number of cells within the affected organ or tissue are able to function properly as a result of this therapy, then the disorder may be reversed.
 In gene therapy, DNA that encodes for a corrected gene and its associated protein is packaged within a “vector”, which is often a virus that has been modified so that it can insert its DNA into specific cells but cannot replicate or cause infections. This vector is used to transfer the DNA to the affected cells within the body. Treatment of blood-based disorders frequently relies on introduction of the vector to blood stem and progenitor cells (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (“HSPCs”)) after they have been removed from the body and separated from other blood or bone marrow cells. This is known as ex vivo transduction. Following ex vivo transduction, the corrected HSPCs must then be reinfused into a patient in a way that allows them to grow inside the bone marrow, so that they can replenish a patient’s hematopoietic (blood) system with cells that express a corrected (healthy) version of the protein that caused the disease. For Rocket’s current gene therapy programs, hematopoietic stem cells are transduced with LVV containing the gene of interest.
 When therapeutic vectors are directly injected into the body (either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body), this is known as in vivo gene therapy. As is the case with ex vivo gene therapy, in vivo gene therapy is effective if the vector is able to enter the appropriate cell population in sufficient number, and is able to insert the corrected gene into these cells’ DNA. If the 
 4

corrected gene is transferred and subsequently expressed by the cell machinery, the missing or defective protein can be produced and the underlying disorder may be corrected. Gene therapy of monogenic diseases is considered an approach by which the underlying cause of a disease may be treated.
 Essential Terminology.
 Set forth below is an abbreviated index of certain key terms and optimal ranges of values used in the discussion of LVV and AAV gene therapies.

Term | Definition | Optimal Ranges 
LVV Therapy (hematopoietic disorders) 
CD34+ cell(s) | Hematopoietic Stem Cell (most CD34+ cells are not true stem cells, but this continues to be the most clinically useful measure) | Will depend on underlying disorder, generally > 1 million CD34+ cells/kg. 
Vector copy number (VCN) [product] | The average number of gene copies per infused stem cell (as determined by DNA analysis; this is an average ratio, not a precise value) | 2.0 (“normal” value)0.5 to 2 has been target in some LVV clinical studies(5.0 considered maximum) 
Vector copy number (VCN) [in vivo, post-treatment] | The average number of gene copies per peripheral blood or bone marrow cell (as determined by DNA analysis; this is an average ratio, not a precise value) | Will depend on underlying disorder, but many disorders may be correctable with in vivo VCNs << 1.0
AAV Therapy 
Vector copy number (VCN) [in vivo, post-treatment] | The average number of gene copies per cell in the organ of interest (as determined by DNA analysis; this is an average ratio, not a precise value) | Will depend on underlying disorder, but many disorders may be correctable with in vivo VCNs << 1.0

Development Programs
 Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A (FANCA):
 Fanconi Anemia Overview
 FA, a rare and life-threatening DNA-repair disorder, generally arises from a mutation in a single FA gene. An estimated 60-70% of cases arise from mutations in the Fanconi-A (“FANCA”) gene, which is the focus of the current Rocket programs.
 FA results in bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, myeloid leukemia and other malignancies, often during the early years and decades of life. Bone marrow aplasia, which is bone marrow that no longer produces any or very few red and white blood cells and platelets leading to infections and bleeding, is the most frequent cause of early morbidity and mortality in FA, with a median onset before 10 years of age. Leukemia is the next most common cause of mortality, ultimately occurring in about 20% of patients later in life. Solid organ malignancies, such as head and neck cancers, can also occur, although at lower rates during the first two to three decades of life.
 Although improvements in allogeneic (donor-mediated) HSCT, currently the most frequently utilized therapy for FA, have resulted in more frequent hematologic correction of the disorder, HSCT is associated with both acute and long-term risks, including transplant-related mortality, GVHD, a sometimes fatal side effect of allogeneic transplant characterized by painful ulcers in the GI tract, liver toxicity and skin rashes, as well as increased risk of subsequent cancers. Rocket’s gene therapy programs in FA are designed to enable a minimally toxic hematologic correction using a patient’s own stem cells during the early years of life. Rocket believes that the development of a broadly applicable autologous gene therapy can be transformative for these patients.
 Current Therapy
 Allogeneic HSCT may be curative for the hematologic manifestations of FA and is currently considered a standard-of-care in FA. However, HSCT is limited in that not all patients have a suitable donor and there is associated short term mortality and potential for acute and chronic GVHD with HSCT, especially in patients who do not receive an allograft from a sibling-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor. 100-day mortality following allogeneic HSCT continues to be in the 10-15% range due to infection, 
 5

graft failure and other complications. In a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant 2013 publication, a retrospective analysis detailed results from 795 FA patients receiving HSCT from 1972 to 2010 in which Grade 2-4 Acute GVHD was reported in 19-36% of patients and Chronic GVHD was identified in 16-20% of patients.
 HSCT likely increases the already high risk of subsequent solid tumor malignancies for patients with FA, most notably squamous carcinoma of the head and neck (“SCCHN”). Based on the findings in one series of data, HSCT was associated with a 4-fold increase in SCCHN risk relative to FA patients who did not receive a transplant, with cancers developing at an earlier age.
 Other therapies utilized for FA include androgens, corticosteroids and hematopoietic growth factors, although the benefits of these therapies are considered modest and transient for the majority of patients. Side effects may also be considerable. For androgens, for example, these include masculinization, short stature, hepatitis, liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Because of the severity of the disease and limitations with existing standards-of-care, additional, minimally-toxic therapies are urgently needed in FA, especially if these can be administered with reduced short- and long-term toxicity relative to allogeneic HSCT.
 Rationale for Gene Therapy in FA
 Gene therapy has been considered a compelling investigative therapeutic option in FA since the genetic basis of the disorder was characterized, and has been the subject of studies in both preclinical models and in several clinical studies. In addition to the monogenic nature of each patient’s disease, Rocket believes there are two critical factors that will lead Rocket’s gene therapy programs into the next generation of promising therapy:
 
 
1. | The ability of HSCT to cure the hematologic component of FA is proof-of-principle that gene therapy will work in FA. If a sufficient number of hematopoietic stem cells with a correct (non-FA) gene are able to engraft in the bone marrow of an FA patient, the blood component of FA can be eradicated, including both the risk of bone marrow failure and of leukemia. Rocket believes that gene therapy with a patient’s own gene-corrected blood stem cells will work in a similar manner, but likely with fewer side effects than those resulting from an allogeneic transplant and with reduced long-term treatment cost burden.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Somatic mosaicism in up to 15% of FA patients leads to stabilization and correct blood counts, in some cases for decades. We believe this demonstrates that a modest number of gene corrected HSCs can repopulate a patient’s blood and bone marrow with corrected (non-FA) cells. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. | Improved vector design, stem cell selection methods, cell harvest and transduction procedures have the potential to substantially improved the quality of autologous gene therapy cell products; many of these improvements have been included in Rocket’s Hutch and CIEMAT programs. As a result, Rocket believes that there is reliable potential to confer disease correction at levels comparable to allogeneic transplant. For example, stem cell selection methods at both Hutch and CIEMAT have increased both CD34+ cell yield and purity, while retaining select non-CD34+ populations that may be essential for successful engraftment of gene-corrected cells in the bone marrow.

Clinical Development Programs RP-L101 and RP-L102
 Efforts underway at Rocket partners Hutch (developing RP-L101) and CIEMAT (developing RP-L102) have incorporated the recommendations of an international working group that convened November 2010 with the intent of consolidating medical and scientific findings and optimization of future gene therapy clinical study design, with programs designed to overcome FA-specific gene therapy challenges. Rocket partners have demonstrated the ability to successfully mobilize and harvest target numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (“HSPCs”) generally acknowledged to be required for successful therapy. This has been accomplished through the selection of younger patients, and mobilization with both granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor drug products, which are both FDA-approved drugs that increase the number of bone marrow-derived stem cells circulating in the blood. Improvements to cell processing, such as reduced transduction time requirements, optimized transduction conditions, and modified HSPC selection processes, have also led to substantive improvements in cell recovery and in vivo VCN.
 As of March 1, 2018, three patients have received infusion of gene-corrected stem cells with RP-L101 (Hutch) and five patients have received gene-corrected stem cells with RP-L102 (CIEMAT). No cytotoxic conditioning has been used to date. No serious, unexpected side effects have been seen to date in all eight patients.
 As of March 1, 2018, Rocket has data for four of the five patients who have received gene-corrected stem cells with RP-L102 (CIEMAT). These four patients have had stable blood counts during the months subsequent to investigational therapy, despite decreases noted during the months and years preceding gene therapy. Additionally, in vivo VCN (gene markings) in these four patients have been evident in peripheral blood cells during the months subsequent to therapy, with progressive increases noted over time in each patient. 
 6

After the first patient was treated at Hutch, modifications to transduction conditions have yielded improved product VCN data, with transduction products from patients 2 and 3 achieving product VCN levels of 1.83 and at least 0.67, respectively.
 Improvements in the clinical and cell-processing components of Rocket’s FA trials are expected to yield more robust and readily-identifiable disease-reversal, both for the RP-L101 and RP-L102 programs. These improvements include selection of younger patients and identification of blood count profiles that are indicative of adequate stem cell populations capable of mobilization and engraftment in numbers sufficient for reversal of the disorder.
 
In contrast to the high doses of cytotoxic conditioning required for allogeneic transplant in most bone marrow disorders, Rocket’s expectation is that the selective growth advantage of gene-corrected HSPCs in FA will enable the use of non-cytotoxic conditioning agents, low-dose cytotoxic agents, or quite possibly no conditioning agents to facilitate engraftment.
 The engraftment of gene-corrected cells is likely to reduce the incidence of bone marrow failure. In addition, gene-corrected cells are likely to diminish the replicative stress in FA bone marrow, which has been increasingly implicated as a likely driver of the development or bone marrow failure or leukemia.
 Low dose non-myeloablative cytotoxic conditioning agents (using lower than standard chemotherapy doses in order to help decrease cell death and prevent the number of normal blood-forming cells from decreasing in the bone marrow) or non-genotoxic antibody-based conditioning agents to facilitate engraftment of corrected stem cells will also be explored. In addition to transduction enhancers, these modifications will be further evaluated in preclinical and/or clinical programs.
 Regulatory Status
 In the United States, the FA program is in the clinical-stage with an IND in place with the FDA since 2011. Three patients have been treated to date, and enrollment continues. The FA program in the European Union is in the clinical-stage with an IMPD in place with the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products. Five patients have been treated to date, and enrollment continues. Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) have granted orphan drug designation (“ODD”) for the “Lentiviral vector carrying the Fanconi anemia-A (FANCA) gene for the treatment of Fanconi anemia type A.”
 Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency-I (LAD-I):
 Overview of LAD-I
 LAD-I is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of white blood cell adhesion and migration, resulting from mutations in the ITGB2 gene encoding for the Beta-2 Integrin component CD18. Deficiencies in CD18 result in an impaired ability for neutrophils (a subset of infection-fighting white blood cells) to leave blood vessels and enter into tissues where these cells are needed to combat infections. As is the case with many rare diseases, true estimates of incidence are difficult; however, several hundred cases (both living and deceased) have been reported to date.
 Most LAD-I patients are believed to have the severe form of the disease. Severe LAD-I is notable for recurrent, life-threatening infections and substantial infant mortality in patients who do not receive an allogeneic HSCT. Mortality for severe LAD-I has been reported as 60-75% by age two in the absence of allogeneic HCST.
 Current Therapy
 Allogeneic HSCT is the only known curative therapy, with survival rates of approximately 75% in recent studies. Allogeneic HSCT in LAD-I has been associated with frequent severe GVHD, including chronic GVHD and high rates of subsequent non-bacterial infections (most notably cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other viral and systemic fungal infections).
 Because LAD-I is the result of mutations in a single gene (ITGB2), Rocket is developing RP-L201 to enable a potentially curative therapy utilizing patients’ own HSPCs, without the dependency on the rapid identification of an appropriate donor required in allogeneic HSCT therapy. It is anticipated that autologous therapy with RP-L201 will also enable definitive correction of this life-threatening disorder with reduced short- and long-term toxicity relative to allogeneic HSCT.
 Rationale for Gene Therapy in LAD-I
 Rocket believes there are two key reasons why gene therapy could have a transformative role in the treatment of LAD-I: (1) the existence evidence that even modest correction of the expression of the genetic mutation will increase patient survival in severe form of the disease, and (2) consistent and robust improvements in transduction and cell processing. Of note, proprietary transduction protocols currently yield product VCNs ≥ 1 and transduction efficiencies of  > 50%. In addition, with the addition of either of two 
 7

transduction enhancing agents, at least a doubling of product VCN has been demonstrated in preliminary experiments. Studies evaluating combinations of transduction enhancers are underway.
 Rocket believes that combined with a relatively straightforward cell harvest procedure in LAD-I and the likely modest CD18 expression required for clinical impact, RP-L201 can yield a gene therapy product that confers disease resolution comparable to allogeneic HSCT, and without the severe HSCT-associated acute and chronic toxicities.
 Preclinical Proof of Concept
 Preclinical results have indicated correction of LAD-I in mouse models, including restoration of neutrophils’ ability to adhere to endothelial surfaces and migrate from blood vessels towards inflammatory sources. Specifically, gene correction has been shown to restore functional CD18 expression in a CD18 hypomorphic mouse (CD18HYP) model, in which a mouse is conferred a CD18 gene mutation resulting in impaired inflammatory responses, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), and hepatosplenomegaly (swelling of the liver and spleen).
Regulatory Status
 In the EU, the LAD-I program has been discussed with the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health in a pre-IMPD submission meeting in 2017. This program has been granted ODD by the EMA and by the FDA.
 The program is in preclinical stage of development, with a rolling IMPD expected to be filed in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD):
 Overview of PKD
 Red blood cell PKD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the pyruvate kinase L/R (“PKLR”) gene encoding for a component of the red blood cell glycolytic pathway. PKD is characterized by chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, a disorder in which red blood cells do not assume a normal spherical shape and are broken down, leading to decreased ability to carry oxygen to cells, with anemia severity that can range from mild (asymptomatic) to severe forms that may result in childhood mortality or requirement for frequent, lifelong red blood cell (“RBC”) transfusions. The pediatric population is the most commonly and severely affected subgroup of patients with PKD, and PKD often results in splenomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the spleen), jaundice and chronic iron overload which is likely the result of both chronic hemolysis and RBC transfusions. The variability in anemia severity is believed to arise in part from the large number of diverse mutations that may affect the PKLR gene. Estimates of disease incidence have ranged between 3.2 and 51 cases per million in the white U.S. and EU population. Industry estimates suggest at least 2,500 cases in the U.S. and EU have already been diagnosed despite the lack of FDA-approved molecularly targeted therapies.
Current Therapy
 Therapy for PKD is largely supportive, comprised of RBC transfusions and splenectomy for patients who require frequent transfusions. Chronic RBC transfusions alleviate anemia symptoms, but are associated with increased morbidity, predominantly from iron overload which may result in cirrhosis, which is a loss of liver cells and irreversible scarring of the liver, and cardiomyopathy, a chronic disease of the heart muscle that leads to a larger and bulky but inefficient heart, if not diligently managed. Iron chelation, is often considered essential to offset the iron overload associated with chronic hemolysis and RBC transfusions. Iron chelation entails continuous oral or injected therapy, often for the duration of a patient’s lifetime and has been associated with diminished quality of life.
 Splenectomy may confer a benefit in PKD, frequently yielding increased hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 1-3g/dL and a reduction in transfusion requirements. However, some patients do not benefit from this procedure, and it is estimated that a substantial proportion of PKD patients remain transfusion-dependent despite splenectomy. Splenectomy does not eliminate hemolysis, iron overload or the need for iron chelation. It also confers an increased susceptibility to serious bacterial infections, and potentially increases the risk of other PKD-associated or other complications such as venous thromboembolism and aplastic or hemolytic crises.
 Allogeneic HSCT has been performed successfully for a small number of PKD patients, with reported correction of the clinical and laboratory features of the disorder. Although reports of HSCT in PKD suggest that correction of the genetic defect in hematopoietic stem cells may be curative of the disorder, HSCT requires identification of an appropriate HLA-matched donor, is associated with considerable short- and long-term complications including transplant-related mortality and is not considered a standard-of-care in PKD.

Rationale for Gene Therapy in PKD
 Patients with heterozygous PKLR mutations have 50% of normal enzyme activity and are phenotypically normal. This suggests that it is not necessary for a therapy to achieve normal enzyme levels to have a clinically meaningful effect. In PKD-affected mice transplanted with normal marrow, the presence of 10% normal marrow was sufficient to restore normal red blood cells. Rocket has conducted experiments in which bone marrow cells from healthy mice are transplanted into PKD affected mice and these results suggest that significant improvement in PKD may be achieved with 20% correction of bone marrow, and complete clinical resolution is likely achiev
ed when the percentage of bone marrow gene-corrected cells is in the 20-40% range. An additional study showed that a PKD-affected dog treated with an ex vivo gene therapy was rendered transfusion independent with a normalization of lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”), despite only partial gene correction.
 Of note, proprietary transduction protocols in PKD now yield product VCNs of 2, with VCNs increasing to ≥ 4 with the addition of transduction enhancers. Rocket expects that mobilization and harvesting procedures will be relatively straightforward for PKD patients.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept
 Rocket expects that mobilization and harvesting procedures will be relatively straightforward for PKD patients. Preclinical results have demonstrated that RP-L301 corrects multiple components of the disorder in a PKD mouse model, including increases in hemoglobin (in both primary and secondary transplant recipients), reduction in reticulocytosis, which is an increase in immature red blood cell production, correction of splenomegaly and reduction in hepatic erythroid clusters and iron deposits.
 Regulatory status
 In the EU, the PKD program has been discussed with the EMA via a Scientific Advisory meeting in 2016. This program has been granted EMA orphan drug disease designation and FDA orphan drug disease designation. The program is in the preclinical stage of development, with a rolling IMPD expected to be filed in the next 12 months.
 Infantile Malignant Osteopetrosis (IMO):
 Overview of Infantile Malignant Osteopetrosis
 IMO represents the autosomal recessive, severe variants of a group of disorders characterized by increased bone density and bone mass secondary to impaired bone resorption. IMO typically presents in the first year of life and is associated with severe manifestations leading to death within the first decade of life in the absence of allogeneic HSCT, although HSCT results have been limited to-date and notable for frequent graft failure, GVHD and other severe complications.
 Approximately 50% of IMO results from mutations in the TCIRG1 gene, resulting in cellular defects that prevent osteoclast bone resorption. As a result of this defect, bone growth is markedly abnormal. It is estimated that IMO occurs in 1 out of 250,000-300,000 within the general global population, although incidence is higher in specific geographic regions including Costa Rica, parts of the Middle East, the Chuvash Republic of Russia, and the Vasterbotten Province of Northern Sweden.
 IMO is characterized by increased bone mass and density, multiple deformities and a propensity for fractures in patients surviving infancy. Skull deformities include macrocephaly and frontal bossing. Thoracic size may be decreased. Bone sclerosis impinges cranial nerve and spinal foramina with resulting neurologic abnormalities, including hydrocephalus, progressive blindness and auditory impairment. Compression of bone marrow space results in bone marrow failure with compensatory hepatosplenomegaly and increased infection risk secondary to neutropenia.
 Current Therapy
 Allogeneic HSCT is potentially curative, but notable for considerable rates of engraftment failure, GVHD, pulmonary and hepatic complications. In a recent multicenter retrospective series, long-term survival rates for HSCT recipients with IMO were approximately 60% for matched-sibling recipients, and 40% for those with mismatched or unrelated allografts.
 Preclinical Proof-of-Concept
 Because osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, correction of the TCIRG1 gene in hematopoietic stem cells will enable development of functional, bone-resorbing osteoclasts, as has been demonstrated in preclinical models. Preclinical results demonstrate that gene correction of HSPCs from IMO patients is feasible, and that these HSPCs can engraft in 
 9

immunocompromised mice. Osteoclasts from these mice demonstrate increased bone resorption in vitro, as measured by increased calcium and collagen fragment CTX-I.
 Additional preclinical experiments have demonstrated correction of an osteopetrotic (IMO) phenotype displayed by the oc/oc mouse model, in which even limited engraftment of wild-type murine bone marrow cells (including 4-5% wild-type engraftment) has been associated with reversal of the osteopetrosis phenotype.
 Regulatory status
 This program is currently in preclinical stages of development and additional preclinical studies are planned.
 AAV-Targeted Program:
 RP-A101 is in preclinical development as an in vivo therapy of an undisclosed neuromuscular and cardiovascular disorder that is estimated to have a prevalence of 15,000 to 30,000 in the US/EU. This is a monogenic disorder that presents with severe clinical manifestations in childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, and is frequently fatal within several years of presentation in the absence of a curative organ transplant procedures.
 Preliminary preclinical studies have indicated that clinically feasible AAV doses can restore functional levels of protein in knockout mouse models, and that gene/protein restoration are associated with marked histologic improvement in the organs in which the disorder causes extensive morbidity and mortality. The figure below shows abnormal tissue in a diseased knockout mouse in the middle (placebo treated), with the AAV gene therapy-treated knockout mouse on the right having tissue comparable to the wild type (i.e. normal) mouse on the left.
 

FIGURE: Representative electron microscopy tissue images from animal model of undisclosed AAV program. Left panels indicate wild-type (normal) animals; middle panels indicate diseased animals treated with control (EGFP) vector; and right panels indicate RP-A101 mediated restoration of architecture and resolution of additional abnormalities.
 Rocket’s AAV program is designed to enable a single-injection definitive therapy for this devastating disease, in which there exists no reliably curative treatment option.
 Regulatory Status
 RP-A101 is currently in preclinical development. A FDA pre-pre-IND meeting occurred in January 2018, and Rocket anticipates filing an IND in the next 12 months.
 CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in Fanconi Anemia:
 Gene editing by means of CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases continues to be a promising investigational mechanism involving direct correction of a specified gene mutation. Gene editing has been feasible with increasing efficiency in cultured FA lymphoblast cell lines and in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from FA patients. Editing in FANCA HSPCs has conferred a proliferation advantage versus uncorrected in-vitro stem cells, conferred resistance to mitomycin-C, which is a chemotherapeutic medicine that fights cancer by interrupting DNA function in rapidly dividing cells, and enabled assembly of FA DNA repair cellular elements.

 Intellectual property
 Rocket strives to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of its business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Rocket also relies on trade secrets relating to its proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain its proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of Rocket’s business. Rocket additionally intends to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 Rocket’s commercial success may depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to its business; defend and enforce its patents; preserve the confidentiality of its trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Rocket’s ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing its future products may depend on the extent to which Rocket has rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, Rocket cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of its pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by Rocket in the future, nor can Rocket be sure that any of its existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting its commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 Rocket has in-licensed numerous patent applications and possesses substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Rocket’s proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to gene expression vectors and methods of using the same for gene therapy. As of March 1, 2018, Rocket’s patent portfolio includes four in-licensed patent families relating to its product candidates and related technologies, discussed more fully below. Specifically, Rocket has in-licensed two pending international patent applications, filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), relating to Rocket’s disclosed product candidates, one pending PCT application relating to an undisclosed product candidate, and pending patent applications in the U.S., Europe and Japan relating to devices, methods, and kits for harvesting and genetically-modifying target cells.
 Fanconi Anemia
 Rocket’s Fanconi Anemia program includes two in-licensed patent families. The first family includes a pending PCT application with claims directed to polynucleotide cassettes and expression vector compositions containing Fanconi Anemia complementation group genes and methods for using such vectors to provide gene therapy in mammalian cells for treating Fanconi Anemia. This application was exclusively in-licensed from CIEMAT, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica En Red, (“CIBER”), Fundacion Instituto de investigacion Sanitaria Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, (“FIISFJD”), and Fundacion Para la Investigacion Biomedica del Hospital Del Nino Jesus, (“FIBHNJS”). Rocket expects any patents in this family, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The second family includes pending U.S., Japanese, and European patent applications related to a portable platform for use in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell-based gene therapy. This patent family was exclusively in-licensed from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Rocket expects any patents in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (PKD)
 Rocket’s PKD patent portfolio includes a pending PCT application with claims directed to polynucleotide cassettes and expression vector compositions containing pyruvate kinase genes and methods for using such vectors to provide gene therapy in mammalian cells for treating pyruvate kinase deficiency. This application was exclusively in-licensed from CIEMAT, CIBER, and FIISFJD. Rocket expects any patents in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 Rocket’s objective is to continue to expand its portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect Rocket’s gene therapy product candidates and manufacturing processes. From time to time, Rocket may also evaluate opportunities to sublicense its portfolio of patents and patent applications that it owns or exclusively licenses, and Rocket may enter into such licenses from time to time. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which Rocket files, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 11

The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, Rocket expects to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering Rocket’s product candidates and their methods of use.
 Rocket may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect its technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Rocket seeks to protect its proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. Rocket also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of its premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. While Rocket has confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and Rocket may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, Rocket’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that Rocket’s consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for Rocket, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

 Rocket may terminate this agreement at any time by providing Hutch with 180 days advance notice. The agreement will expire upon the expiration, lapse, abandonment or invalidation of the last claim of the licensed patent rights to expire, lapse or become abandoned or unenforceable in all countries worldwide.
 License Agreements with CIEMAT
 In March 2016, Rocket entered into a license agreement with CIEMAT, CIBER, and FIISFJD, (collectively, “CIEMAT”), granting Rocket worldwide, exclusive rights to certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property relating to lentiviral vectors containing the human PKLR gene solely within the field of treating pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD). Under the terms of the agreement, Rocket is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more products or processes covered by the licensed intellectual property, introduce such products or processes into the commercial market and then make them reasonably available to the public (b) develop or commercialize at least one product or process covered by the licensed intellectual property in at least one country for at least two uninterrupted years following regulatory approval, and (c) use the licensed intellectual property in an adequate, ethical and legitimate manner. In exchange for the license, Rocket is obligated to pay CIEMAT an up-front payment, royalty payments based on net sales of products or processes involving any of the licensed intellectual property, developmental and regulatory milestone payments, and sublicense revenue payments. Rocket is responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents at Rocket’s expense, in cooperation with CIEMAT. Rocket also has the first responsibility to enforce and defend the licensed patents against infringement and/or challenge, in cooperation with CIEMAT. For five years following the effective date of the license agreement, Rocket has a right of first refusal to license any improvements to the licensed intellectual property obtained by CIEMAT at market value. Rocket is obligated to license (without charge) to CIEMAT for non-commercial use any improvements to the licensed intellectual property that Rocket creates.
 As consideration for the licensed rights, Rocket paid CIEMAT an initial upfront license fee of €0.03 million (approximately $0.03 million) which was expensed as research and development costs. Rocket is obligated to make aggregate milestone payments of up to €1.4 million (approximately $1.5 million) to CIEMAT upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. With respect to any commercialized products covered by the PKD license, Rocket is obligated to pay a low to mid-single digit percentage royalty on net sales, subject to specified adjustments, by Rocket or its sublicensees or affiliates. In the event that Rocket enters into a sublicense agreement with a sublicensee, Rocket will be obligated to pay a portion of any consideration received from such sublicensees in specified circumstances.
 Rocket may terminate this agreement at any time by providing CIEMAT with 90 days advance notice. The license is in effect for a duration for each of the countries defined in this agreement for as long as a license right exists that covers the licensed product or process in such country, or until the end of any additional legal protection that should be obtained for the license rights in each country.
 In July 2016, Rocket entered into a license agreement with CIEMAT granting Rocket worldwide, exclusive rights to certain patents, know-how, data and other intellectual property relating to lentiviral vectors containing the Fanconi Anemia-A gene solely within the field of human therapeutic uses of VSV-G packaged integration component lentiviral vectors for Fanconi Anemia type-A gene therapy.

The license is in effect for a duration for each of the countries defined in this agreement for as long as a license right exists that covers the licensed product or process in such country, or until the end of any additional legal protection that should be obtained for the license rights in each country.
 
Contract Research and Collaboration Agreement with Lund University and J. Richter
 In August 2016, Rocket entered into a research and collaboration agreement with Lund University and Johan Richter, M.D., Ph.D. under which Dr. Richter grants to Rocket an exclusive, perpetual, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain intellectual property rights of Dr. Richter relating to lentiviral-mediated gene transfer to treat Osteopetrosis. In exchange for the license, Rocket is obligated to make an up-front payment, certain clinical and commercial milestone payments, royalty payments (on net sales of products covered by a valid claim within the licensed intellectual property) and sublicense revenue payments to Dr. Richter. Under the terms of the agreement, Lund University and Dr. Richter are obligated to perform contract research for Rocket regarding the use of lentiviral-mediated gene transfer to treat Osteopetrosis. Intellectual property resulting from the contract research created by Dr. Richter is included in the license described above and also subject to an option for Rocket to purchase ownership of such rights. Intellectual property created by Lund University in conducting such research is non-exclusively licensed to Rocket for non-commercial use and also subject to an option for Rocket to purchase or license such intellectual property under commercially reasonable terms. Rocket is obligated to pay for the contract research according to an agreed budget in quarterly installments in advance.

Rocket is obligated to make aggregate payments of up to €1.4 million (approximately $1.5 million) to Licensors upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. With respect to any commercialized products covered by the LAD-I license, Rocket is obligated to pay a mid-single digit percentage royalty on net sales, subject to specified adjustments, by Rocket or its sublicensees or affiliates. In the event that Rocket enters into a sublicense agreement with a sublicensee, Rocket will be obligated to pay a portion of any consideration received from such sublicensees in specified circumstances.
 Rocket may terminate this agreement at any time by providing Licensors with 90 days advance notice. The license is in effect for a duration for each of the countries defined in this agreement for as long as a license right exists that covers the licensed product or process in such country, or until the end of any additional legal protection that should be obtained for the license rights in each country.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the field of gene therapy, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products and novel therapies. While Rocket believes that its experience and scientific knowledge provides it with competitive advantages, Rocket faces potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, new market entrants and new technologies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat the indications targeted by Rocket’s pipeline that have not yet been conceived. Any product candidates that Rocket successfully develops and commercializes will compete with existing therapies such as bone marrow transplantation and new therapies that may become available in the future. Rocket believes that the key competitive factors affecting the success of Rocket’s product candidates, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, pharmaco-economic value, tolerability and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental authorities and other third-party payors. In addition, Rocket intends to develop single treatment curative therapies for clinical indications that address mortality or high morbidity, which could differentiate Rocket from potential competitors developing alternative competitive therapies that may require chronic or repetitive treatment.  
 Other early-stage companies may also compete through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of companies developing gene therapies. These companies also compete with Rocket in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Rocket’s programs.
 Rocket anticipates that it will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and therapeutic modalities enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Rocket’s commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if Rocket’s potential competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer adverse effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that Rocket may develop. Rocket’s potential competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than Rocket may obtain approval for its products. 
 Manufacturing
 Rocket’s gene therapy platform has two main components: the production of LVV vectors and AAV vectors and the target cell transduction process, which results in drug product. Rocket does not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of its product candidates. Rocket currently relies on third-party manufacturers to produce the plasmids, vectors, cell banks and final drug product for its clinical trials. Rocket manages such production with its vendors on a purchase order basis in accordance with applicable master service and supply agreements. Rocket has not yet entered into long-term agreements with these manufacturers or any other third-party suppliers, as it is customary in the industry to enter into commercial supply agreements upon either achievement of proof-of-concept or as a company approaches registration trials. Rocket, however, intends to procure quantities on a purchase order basis from redundant and multiple sources for Rocket’s clinical and commercial production to mitigate risk. If any of Rocket’s existing third-party suppliers should become unavailable to Rocket for any reason, Rocket believes that there are a number of potential replacements, although Rocket might experience a delay in its ability to obtain alternative suppliers. Rocket also does not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of its product candidates if they become registered. With respect to commercial production of Rocket’s product candidates in the future, Rocket plans to outsource production of the active pharmaceutical (drug substance) ingredients as well as final drug product manufacturing (drug product) if they are approved and registered for marketing authorization by the applicable regulatory bodies.
 15

Rocket expects to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced in a cost effective manner at contract manufacturing facilities. However, should a supplier or manufacturer on which Rocket has relied to produce a product candidate provide Rocket with a faulty product or such product is later recalled, Rocket would likely experience delays and additional costs, each of which could be significant.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Regulation and Marketing Approval
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and biologics under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), the regulations promulgated under both laws and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions and non-approval of product candidates. These sanctions could include, among other things, the imposition by the FDA of a clinical hold on trials, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications or related supplements, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Such actions by government agencies could also require us to expend a large amount of resources to respond to the actions. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, post-approval monitoring, advertising, promotion, sampling and import and export of our products. Rocket’s drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process, and Rocket’s biologics, including its gene therapy product candidate, through the BLA process, before they may be legally marketed in the United States.
 Within the FDA, the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products and has published guidance documents with respect to the development these types of products. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), or other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND, which allows clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use or uses conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), which are international ethical and scientific quality standards meant to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and that the integrity of the data is maintained;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA in the case of a drug or BLA in the case of a biologic;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and of selected clinical trial sites to assess compliance with GCP requirements; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA approval of an NDA or BLA which must occur before a drug or biologic can be marketed or sold.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with 
 16

manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
 Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 IND and Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, an initial IND, which contains the results of preclinical testing along with other information, such as information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed protocol, must be submitted to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the drug product or the conduct of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical hold. A clinical hold may also be imposed at any time while the IND is in effect. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin or re-commence. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence or continue.
 Where a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (“OBA”), pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”). Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”), a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations, at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA website and may be accessed by the public.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA, BLA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary.
 A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted must review and approve the clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed written consent must also be obtained from each trial subject. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor, may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements.
 For purposes of an NDA or BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: Trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the product appears effective and has an acceptable safety profile, and provide sufficient information for the design of Phase 3 trials, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
multiple clinical trial sites. They are intended to further evaluate dosage, effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling and approval by the FDA. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations, GCP requirements and their protocols in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
 An investigational drug product that is a combination of two different drugs in a single dosage form must comply with an additional rule that requires that each component make a contribution to the claimed effects of the drug product and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling of the drug product. This typically requires larger studies that test the drug against each of its components. In addition, typically, if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with our products, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.
 Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates or new drugs for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved up to a maximum of two years. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 The NDA and BLA Approval Process
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical or preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators that meet GCP requirements.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the End-of-Phase 1 or 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meetings to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to conduct an initial review to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA has agreed to specific performance goals on the review of NDAs and BLAs and seeks to review standard NDAs for new molecular entities in 10 months 
 18

from the 60-day filing date (typically 12 months from submission of the NDA). The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. After the FDA completes its substantive review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the drug will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the NDA or BLA will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, non-clinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the NDA or BLA. Additionally, notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied for continuing drug approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. In addition, the FDA has authority to require sponsors to conduct post-marketing trials to specifically address safety issues identified by the agency. See “Post-Marketing Requirements” below.
 The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the NDA or BLA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the NDA or BLA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “Dear Doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases distribution and use restrictions, referred to as “elements to assure safe use,” or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA or BLA approval, and in some cases the approval date may be delayed. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution or use, or post-marketing trial requirements. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, including safety labeling or imposition of a REMS, the requirement to conduct post-market studies or clinical trials or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval for our products, or obtaining approval but for significantly limited use, would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future United States or foreign governmental action.
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a portion of a product’s U.S. patent term that was lost during clinical development and regulatory review by the FDA may be restored by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between 
 19

the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided that the sponsor acted with diligence. Patent term restorations, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 Market Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain competing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a drug product that contains the protected active moiety. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, or supplement, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the same conditions of approval as the innovator drug. This three-year exclusivity protects only the conditions of approval associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications with different conditions of approval. For example, if three-year exclusivity protected a new extended-release dosage form, the exclusivity would not block approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the original immediate-release version of the drug. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data.
 Post-Marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, or off-label use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may, in their independent professional medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers typically may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, who may or may not grant approval or may include a lengthy review process.
 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”), a part of the FDCA.
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacturing is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. NDA holders using 
 20

contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such product or may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 In addition, the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are subject to annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, also known as Phase 4 testing, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval via a REMS that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, withdrawal of approval, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government healthcare program administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers, and other entities. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all of part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, our products, once approved, may not obtain market acceptance unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drug products and medical services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
 In particular, our success may depend on our ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement through Medicare Part D plans for our products that obtain regulatory approval. The Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. In general, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors have flexibility regarding coverage of Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class, with certain exceptions. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive regulatory approval. However, any negotiated prices for 
 21

our future products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be discounted, thereby lowering the net price realized on our sales to pharmacies. Moreover, while the Part D program applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-government payors.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates, once approved. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
 In the United States, among other things, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation and enforcement by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. Our current and future business activities, including for example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with healthcare regulatory laws, as applicable, which may include the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy and security regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended, physician payment transparency laws, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act 
 22

(collectively, the “ACA”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future business activities, including our sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with ophthalmologists and optometrists might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us.
 Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent. This statute has been interpreted to prohibit presenting claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been found liable under the Federal Civil False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a civil False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the Federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the Federal Civil False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the Federal False Claims Act.
 Additionally, HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, as discussed below, a similar federal requirement under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of individuals and organizations. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other and from HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 23

We plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the law and program requirements to which we will or may become subject because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs.
 Changes in law or the interpretation of existing law could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Affordable Care Act and Other Reform Initiatives
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted. The ACA includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
  
• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in exchange for state Medicaid coverage of most of the manufacturer’s drugs. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents to 23.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs used in orphan indications. In addition, because 340B pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. The ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic agents to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA included the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exception, to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” provided, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to CMS for the first reporting period (August 1, 2013—December 31, 2013) by March 31, 2014, and were required to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the completeness and accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. The information reported was made publicly available on a searchable website in September 2014.

• | The ACA established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board which has the authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to improve quality of care and lower program costs of Medicare, Medicaid and the Children’s

Health Insurance Program, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation through 2019.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the details regarding the implementation of the ACA are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the ACA would have on our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Union, our products will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained, and the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trial regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved by two distinct bodies in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”) and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). In addition, all serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a revision process mainly aimed at making more uniform and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing the transparency of clinical trials.
 European Union Drug Review Approval
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining an MAA. There are two types of MAAs: (1) the Community MAA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), a body of the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and (2) the National MAA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only authorized marketing in that Member State’s national territory and not the EEA as a whole.
 The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MAA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MAA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MAA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MAA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MAA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MAA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 25

In addition, in the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”) is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced therapy medicinal products. The role of the CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for a gene therapy medicinal candidate that is submitted to the EMA. The development and evaluation of a gene therapy medicinal product must be considered in the context of the relevant European Union guidelines, and the EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines.
