ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, August 18, 1992. Prior to the Acquisition (as defined below), we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Acquisition, we have ceased to be a “shell company” and will continue as a publicly traded company under the name StemGen, Inc. The existing business operations of D3esports, Inc. will continue as our wholly subsidiary.

On January 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we completed and closed the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) under an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Reorganization Agreement”), entered into by and among by and among (i) StemGen, Inc.(“StemGen”); (ii) D3esports, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“D3esports”); (ii) and the shareholders of D3esports (“Sellers”) pursuant to which D3esports became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of D3esports in exchange for 39,631,587 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 7,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. As a result of the Acquisition, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of D3esports, became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger notwithstanding it is legally a reverse acquisition. For accounting purposes, D3esports is the acquiring entity. Current and comparative consolidated financial statements include the accounts of D3esports since inception (May 1, 2018) and StemGen from the date of acquisition (January 29, 2019) (collectively, the “Company”). 

D3esports was formed on May 1, 2018 and is based in Angleton, TX. D3esports plans to hold monthly time trial format competitions through an eSports platform that allows professional race car drivers and eSport athletes (gamer enthusiasts) to compete for a real experience in a race car and points that can be used to purchase products and services through our partners and
