ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

General
 We are a Texas corporation formed in 1984 that is engaged in developing biologics for the treatment of human and animal diseases. Our current focus is research aimed at the treatment of human disease indications, particularly influenza, hepatitis C, thrombocytopenia, and other indications using natural human interferon alpha that is administered in a proprietary low dose oral form.
 
We currently own or license five issued patents, three in the U.S., and one in Taiwan, all related to the low-dose oral delivery of interferon and we own one issued patent on our dietary supplement, Maxisal®.  In our history, we have completed more than 100 pre-clinical (animal) and human studies on the safety and efficacy of low-dose orally administered interferon.  On October 31, 2013, Amarillo Biosciences, Inc., (ABI) filed a voluntary petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, for protection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. code.  The Company successfully reorganized both organizationally and financially and exited bankruptcy in January of 2015.
 
In addition to the core technology discussed in the first paragraph of this section, ABI is currently working at instituting new revenue streams along with the core technology thus expanding the Company's current focus into a diversified business portfolio.
 
Current Status
 The Company completely reorganized and was restructured into three business units: the Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Consumer Product Divisions. Historically, the Company has focused on R&D involving low-dose, orally administered lozenges containing interferon-alpha as a treatment for a variety of conditions. Under the leadership of Dr. Stephen T. Chen, ABI began its new life with a valuable intellectual property portfolio including five issued patents and a trademark.  Additionally, ABI has a library of almost thirty years of scientific and clinical data on the human and animal applications of low dose oral interferon. Through the Pharmaceutical Product Division along with technology and know-how available in the collection of intellectual property as well as the proprietary research history, ABI will out-license, or leverage, its core technology and form partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to develop new discoveries and commercialize the resulting products.
  

An integral part of the ABI Operating Plan is to create multiple revenue streams through the implementation of programs (including but not limited to in-licensing) of medical and health care products and processes. The Medical Division and Consumer Products Division will facilitate the enhancement of those revenue streams. These programs will be the catalyst which allows ABI to enter markets in Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, and other Asian countries for the distribution of these new medical and health care products. Already, the Medical Division is preparing to deploy unique metabolic treatment centers in Taiwan beginning sometime in the third quarter of 2018. These health care clinics will provide novel therapies for the management of diabetes and other endocrine diseases to relieve the negative impact and complications of human metabolic disorders. Therapies and treatments provided by the clinics are intended to reduce human suffering and manage health care costs through reduction in the need for expensive medical procedures and medications ultimately resulting in the decrease of the number and frequency of costly emergency room visits and subsequent patient hospital admissions.  It is also anticipated that a reduction in the length of the hospital stays would occur. Likewise, the Consumer Product Division is presently working on multiple endeavors. First, this ABI division will offer a unique proprietary liposomal delivery system for nutraceuticals and food supplements such as Vitamin C, Glutathione, CoQ10, Curcumin/Resveratrol, DHA, and a Multi-Vitamin. Additionally, the liposomal delivery system can be topically used to administer quality skin care products. Next, Consumer Products has commenced negotiations to import and distribute to the Asian markets a unique natural resource product which can be modified for human, animal, or agricultural applications.
 The overall operating strategy is for ABI to create a world-wide network of strategic alliances capitalizing on advanced and emerging technologies in order to engineer a diversified enterprise having a major impact on every aspect of the healthcare and life sciences industries; and assemble an exhaustive pipeline of technologically-advanced, cutting edge products and services with which to compete in the American and Asian markets. To support this strategy, ABI has opened a branch office, its Asian Operations Center (AOC) in order to increase the Company's presence in Taiwan and to access growing Asian markets.
 
Core Technology 
 Injectable interferon is FDA-approved to treat some neoplastic, viral and autoimmune diseases.  Many patients experience moderate to severe side effects, causing them to discontinue injectable interferon therapy. Our core technology is a natural human interferon alpha that is delivered into the oral cavity as a lozenge in low (nanogram) doses. The lozenge dissolves in the mouth where interferon binds to surface (mucosal) cells in the mouth and throat, resulting in stimulation of immune mechanisms.  Orally delivered interferon has been shown to activate hundreds of immune system genes in the peripheral blood.  Human studies have shown that oral interferon is safe and effective against viral and autoimmune diseases. Oral interferon is given in concentrations 10,000 times less than that usually given by injection. The Company's low dose formulation results in almost no side effects, in contrast to high dose injectable interferon, which causes adverse effects in at least 50% of recipients.
 
The Company also has a dietary supplement product, Maxisal® that is useful in the symptomatic relief of dry mouth.
 Governmental or FDA approval is required for low dose oral interferon.  Our progress toward approval is discussed under each specific indication, below.
 We believe that our technology is sound and can be commercialized.  Due to occurrences in the interferon market over the past several years, we have been unsuccessful at such commercialization.
  

Interferon Supply
 The Company's long-time human interferon producer is no longer able to provide the essential supply of interferon.  Without the interferon, the Company is unable to continue its research, conduct clinical trials, and ultimately unable to commercialize a product.  Options available to ABI to find a suitable interferon source include:  (1) locating a laboratory/production facility that could follow the same path and development model for natural human interferon which was viable for the Company in the past; (2) restart the process from the original cell line and develop the natural human interferon in the laboratory on a commercial level; or (3) select the best source of recombinant interferon which can be developed for the Company's goals.  The Company is exploring its options to determine the optimal choice of interferon supplies to commercialize the products.
 
Regardless of which interferon source is selected, numerous studies and clinical trials will have to be performed.  Although repeating the studies will be both costly and time consuming, the Company will be able to use the thirty years of data that has been previously generated from the numerous studies performed using the original natural human interferon source.  Rather than having to start from the very beginning, the Company will be able to make good use of its history, past results, and data library to employ previously successful developmental models and minimize the trial-and-error searching present in commercial research.
 
While the pharmaceutical industry is creating and marketing new and effective anti-viral medications, ABI believes that there is still sufficient time to develop and commercialize low dose interferon for treatment of such diseases as Influenza, Chronic Cough in COPD, Hepatitis B, C, and D, Sjogren's Syndrome, and Thrombocytopenia caused by other diseases and as a side effect of treatment of other diseases.  The Company also has the opportunity to capitalize on its new access to the Far Eastern markets to explore sources of raw materials, capital, production facilities, and new customers.
 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 Since inception, the Company has worked to build an extensive patent portfolio for low-dose orally administered interferon. This portfolio consists of patents with claims that encompass method of use or treatment, and/or composition of matter and manufacturing. As listed below, we presently own or license five issued patents, including one patent on our dietary supplement.

Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is an expanding and rapidly changing industry characterized by intense competition. We believe that our ability to compete will be dependent in large part upon our ability to successfully operate the newly reorganized business, bring in new business lines, continue recapitalization, redevelop and test our products and continually enhance and improve our products and leverage our core technologies. In order to do so, we must effectively utilize and expand our research and development capabilities and, once developed, expeditiously convert new technology into products and processes, which can be commercialized. Competition is based primarily on scientific and technological superiority, technical support, availability of patent protection, access to adequate capital, the ability to develop, acquire and market products and processes successfully, the ability to obtain governmental approvals and the ability to serve the particular needs of commercial customers.  Corporations and institutions with greater resources than us, therefore, have a significant competitive advantage. Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents for treatment of human and animal disease. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Almost all of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources and experience than us. Our competitors may succeed in developing products or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our products.  We also expect that the number of competitors and potential competitors will increase as more interferon alpha products receive commercial marketing approvals from the FDA or analogous foreign regulatory agencies. Any of these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing, marketing and distributing its products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
United States Regulation
 Before products with health claims can be marketed in the United States, they must receive approval from the FDA. To receive this approval, any drug must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials that demonstrate the product candidate's safety and effectiveness for each indicated use. This extensive regulatory process controls, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution of pharmaceutical products.
 
In general, before any ethical pharmaceutical product can be marketed in the United States, the FDA will require the following process:
 

• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


1 This patent expired subsequent to the Balance Sheet Date of December 31, 2017.  Although the patent has expired, the science behind the patent continues to render the Company's technology as viable technology for the application to and the treatment of Fibromyalgia.
  


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators; 
• | Submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA; and 
• | FDA approval of an NDA, or of an NDA supplement (for subsequent indications or other modifications, including a change in location of the manufacturing facility).

 
Substantial financial resources are necessary to fund the research, clinical trials, and related activities necessary to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. At such time as ABI undertakes to commercialize any of its products, all necessary preclinical testing, clinical trials, data review, and approval steps will be judiciously executed to insure that the product satisfies all regulatory requirements at all levels.
 
505(b)(2)
 ABI has historically followed and will continue to follow the traditional approval process for New Drugs as set out in Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If an alternative path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products is scientifically and economically feasible and beneficial to the Company and the public, ABI may choose to follow this alternative path as established by section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This section of the Act permits the applicant to rely on certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product as some of the information required for approval and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.  The process of approval under 505(b)(2) will be followed as judiciously as 505(b)(1) or any regulation.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. ABI may choose to seek approval for a product satisfying the definition of and Orphan Drug if that product can be used to treat such an indication.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration or rigidity of the regulatory review and approval process.
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of products in foreign countries. Whether or not the Company obtains FDA approval for a product, the Company must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before the Company can commence clinical trials or market the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of investigational drugs or approval of new diseases for existing products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. It is not possible to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
  

Research and Development
 During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not incur any research and development expenses. An integral part of the reorganization process has been to refocus and realign research and development activities.  If a satisfactory replacement source of interferon is located and will serve the goals of the Company, adequate funds to conduct research and development will be allocated.  These research activities include revitalization of the Company's core technology.  Additionally, any number of other attractive technologies might be investigated.
Employees
 The Company has 3 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. Of these employees, 2 are executive officers and 2 work in administrative and research and development capacities; although no costs of these employees are currently allocated to research and development. Consultants in business and research development are also engaged as needed.  Additionally, on January 1, 2018, a full-time employee began work in the capacity of the Branch Manager and Business Development Director for the ABI Branch Office in Taiwan.  The Taiwan Branch Office serves the Company's Asian markets.  Prior to this date, the aforementioned individual executed these positions on a consulting basis.
