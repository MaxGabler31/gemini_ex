ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Meridian Bancorp, Inc. 
 Meridian Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in 2014. The Company owns all of East Boston Savings Bank’s stock and directs, plans and coordinates East Boston Savings Bank’s business activities. The Company is the successor to East Boston Savings Bank’s previous holding company, Meridian Interstate Bancorp, Inc. (“Old Meridian”), and was formed as a result of a second-step mutual-to-stock conversion (the “Conversion”) of Meridian Financial Services, Incorporated, (the “MHC”), the top tier mutual holding company of Old Meridian. The Conversion was completed in 2014 at which point, the MHC and Meridian Interstate Funding Corporation were merged into Old Meridian (and ceased to exist), and Old Meridian merged into the Company.
 On December 29, 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Meetinghouse Bancorp, Inc. (“Meetinghouse”), the holding company for Meetinghouse Bank, a Massachusetts stock co-operative bank, with two full-service branches that were then merged into East Boston Savings Bank. The Meetinghouse acquisition added $120.4 million in total assets at fair value, including $75.7 million in loans and $93.8 million in deposits. The Company paid total cash consideration of $17.8 million, or $26.00 for each outstanding share of Meetinghouse common stock.  
 East Boston Savings Bank 
 East Boston Savings Bank (the “Bank”) is a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank, founded in 1848, that conducts its business from 37 full-service locations, one mobile branch and three loan centers in the greater Boston metropolitan area. We offer a variety of deposit and loan products to individuals and businesses located in our primary market, which consists of Suffolk, Norfolk, Middlesex and Essex Counties, Massachusetts. We attract deposits from the general public and use those funds to originate one- to four-family real estate, multi-family and commercial real estate, construction, commercial and industrial, and consumer loans, which we primarily hold for investment. Our lending business also involves the purchase and sale of loan participation interests.

Market Area
 We consider the greater Boston metropolitan area to be our primary market area. While our primary deposit-gathering area is concentrated in the greater Boston metropolitan area, our lending area encompasses a broader market that includes most of eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, and portions of southeastern New Hampshire, Maine and Rhode Island. We conduct our operations through our 37 full-service offices, one mobile branch and three loan centers located in the following Massachusetts counties, all of which are located in the greater Boston metropolitan area: Essex (six offices and two loan centers), Middlesex (eight offices), Suffolk (21 offices and one loan center) and Norfolk (two offices). The greater Boston metropolitan area is the 10th largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors, the Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging from services, manufacturing and wholesale retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care. The largest employment sector, however, is health care and social services, accounting for 14.5% of businesses in Massachusetts. Based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the unemployment rate for Massachusetts decreased to 2.7% in December 2018 as compared to 3.1% in December 2017. Home prices in Massachusetts rose at an annual rate of 7.9% in the third quarter of 2018 as compared to 5.8% for the third quarter of 2017. 
Competition 
 We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Several large holding companies operate banks in our market area. These institutions are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have greater resources. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Based on data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as of June 30, 2018 (the latest date for which information is available), the Bank had 1.27% of the deposit market share within the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts — New Hampshire metropolitan statistical area, giving us the 10th largest market share in our metropolitan statistical area out of 127 financial institutions in our metropolitan statistical area as of that date. 
 Our competition for loans comes from financial institutions in our market area and from other financial service providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as insurance services, trust services, wealth management and asset-based financing. 
 Lending Activities 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans were $2.622 billion, or 46.4%, of our total loan portfolio. The commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of $836.4 million of fixed-rate loans and $1.786 billion of adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2018. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities. At December 31, 2018, $258.1 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was owner occupied commercial real estate, and the remaining $2.364 billion was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. We intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in loans with other financial institutions. 
 We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans for terms and amortization periods up to 30 years, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five, seven or ten years and generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 25 to 30 years. We also include prepayment penalties on loans we originate. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 75% to 80% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated. In addition, borrowers are generally required by policy to have a minimum income to debt service ratio of 1.20x. We require independent appraisals or evaluations on all loans secured by commercial real estate from an approved appraisers list. We require most of our commercial real estate loan borrowers to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. Our policy is to review all commercial real estate loans over $1 million at least annually along with each of these loan’s commercial real estate borrower and, as applicable, each guarantor. The loan and its borrowers and/or guarantors are subject to an annual risk review verifying that the loan is properly risk rated based upon covenant compliance and other terms as provided for in the loan agreements. While this process does not prevent loans from becoming delinquent, it provides us with the opportunity to better identify problem loans in a timely manner and to work with the borrower prior to the loan becoming delinquent.

The following table provides information with respect to our commercial real estate loans by type at December 31, 2018:
 
 
 | Amount | | Percent | 
---------------------+------------------------+-----------+---------+------
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Accommodations | $ | 217,270 | | 8.3 | %
Industrial/Warehouse | | 557,244 | | 21.2 | 
Mixed use | | 145,398 | | 5.5 | 
Office building | | 864,649 | | 33.0 | 
Retail | | 520,735 | | 19.9 | 
Other | | 316,683 | | 12.1 | 
 | $ | 2,621,979 | | 100.0 | %

 
If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 The average outstanding loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio was $3.4 million as of December 31, 2018. We currently target new individual commercial real estate loan originations to owners and investors in our market area and generally originate loans to one borrower up to $75.0 million. We generally do not make commercial real estate loans outside our primary market areas. Our largest single commercial real estate relationship at December 31, 2018 totaled $80.6 million. These loans are secured by industrial/warehouse properties. Our next largest borrowing relationship at December 31, 2018 was for $72.5 million and is secured by industrial/warehouse properties. The third largest relationship was for $70.0 million at December 31, 2018 and is secured by office buildings. At December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms. 
 One- to Four-Family Residential Loans. Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, most of which serve as the primary residence of the owner. At December 31, 2018, one- to four-family residential loans were $647.4 million, or 11.4% of our total loan portfolio.  The one- to four-family residential portfolio consists of $83.8 million and $563.6 million of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, respectively, at December 31, 2018. We generally offer fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans with terms up to 30 years. Generally, our fixed-rate loans conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac underwriting guidelines and those with longer terms (more than 10 years) are originated with the intention to sell. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally adjust annually or every three years after an initial fixed period that ranges from three to ten years. Management has the intent and ability to hold the remaining fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the one or three year U.S. Treasury index. Depending on the loan type, the maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 2% per adjustment period and the lifetime interest rate caps range from 2% to 6% over the initial interest rate of the loan. Our residential loans generally do not have prepayment penalties. 
 Borrower demand for adjustable-rate compared to fixed-rate loans is a function of the level of interest rates, the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates, and the difference between the interest rates and loan fees offered for fixed-rate mortgage loans as compared to the interest rates and loan fees for adjustable-rate loans. The relative amount of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment. The loan fees, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans are determined by us on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. 
 While our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full either upon sale of the property pledged as security or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. We do not offer loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest-only, one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Additionally, our current practice is generally (1) to sell to the secondary market newly originated longer-term (terms of 10 years or greater) fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and (2) to hold in our portfolio shorter-term, fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. We sell residential real estate loans in the secondary market primarily with servicing released. We also sell loans to Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Bank Mortgage Partnership Finance Program and other investors with servicing retained.

We will make loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95% (100% for first time home buyers) with such value measured at origination; however, we generally require private mortgage insurance for loans with a loan-to-value ratio over 80%. We require all properties securing mortgage loans to be appraised by a licensed real estate appraiser. We generally require title insurance on all first mortgage loans. Borrowers must obtain hazard insurance, and flood insurance is required for loans on properties located in a flood zone. 
 In an effort to provide financing for first-time buyers, we offer fixed-rate 30-year residential real estate loans through the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency First Time Home Buyer Program. We offer mortgage loans through this program to qualified individuals and originate the loans using modified underwriting guidelines and loan conditions. 
 We also offer adjustable-rate loans secured by one- to four-family properties that are not owner-occupied. Non-owner-occupied one- to four-family residential loans generally can be made with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 75% with such value measured at origination. At December 31, 2018, these loans totaled $221.0 million. Non-owner-occupied residential loans can have higher risk of loss than owner-occupied residential loans, as payment on such loans often depends on successful operation and management of the properties. In addition, non-owner-occupied residential borrowers may be more willing to default on a loan than an owner-occupied residential borrower as the non-owner-occupied residential borrower would not be losing his or her residence. 
 Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, multi-family real estate loans were $1.011 billion, or 17.9% of our total loan portfolio. The multi-family loan portfolio consisted of $79.6 million of fixed-rate loans and $930.9 million of adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2018. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by apartment buildings. We intend to continue to grow our multi-family loan portfolio, while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in loans with other financial institutions. 
 We originate a variety of adjustable-rate, multi-family real estate loans for terms up to 30 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five, seven or ten years and generally are adjusted to a rate equal to a percentage above the corresponding U.S. Treasury rate or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate. Most of our adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 25 to 30 years. We also include prepayment penalties on loans we originate. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 75% to 80% of the property’s appraised value at the time the loan is originated. Borrowers are generally required by policy to have a minimum income to debt service ratio of 1.20x. We require most of our multi-family real estate loan borrowers to submit annual financial statements and/or rent rolls on the subject property. These properties may also be subject to annual inspections to support that appropriate maintenance is being performed by the owner/borrower. 
 If we foreclose on a multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on multi-family real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 The average outstanding loan size in our multi-family real estate portfolio was $2.0 million as of December 31, 2018. We currently target new individual multi-family real estate loan originations to owners and investors in our market area and generally originate loans to one borrower up to $75.0 million. 
 We generally do not make multi-family real estate loans outside our primary market areas. 
 Our largest multi-family real estate relationship at December 31, 2018 totaled $52.0 million and originated in 2016. Our next largest multi-family borrowing relationship at December 31, 2018 was for $46.7 million and the third largest multi-family borrowing relationship was for $44.8 million. Each relationship is secured by apartment buildings. At December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Construction Loans.  Historically, we have invested a significant portion of our loan portfolio in construction loans for commercial real estate, multi-family properties and one- to four-family residential developments.  Although well diversified with respect to price ranges and borrowers, our construction loans are significantly concentrated in the greater Boston metropolitan area.  At December 31, 2018, construction loans were $686.9 million, or 12.1% of our total loan portfolio. 
 7

We primarily make construction loans for commercial development projects, including apartment buildings, condominiums, small industrial buildings and retail and office buildings. Most of our construction loans provide for the payment of only interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 to 36 months, although some construction loans are renewed, generally for one or two additional years. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be paid in full. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% of the discounted appraised market value upon completion of the project. As appropriate to the underwriting, a “discounted cash flow analysis” is utilized. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will generally require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. 
 We also originate construction and site development loans to contractors and builders to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions. While we may originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions. We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. The maximum number of speculative loans (loans that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors, including the financial capacity of the builder, the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains. We have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of experienced small and mid-sized builders within our market area. 
 We regularly monitor the construction loan portfolio and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and increase or decrease this type of lending as we observe market conditions change.  We believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place have helped to mitigate some of the risks inherent in construction and land lending.
 The composition of our construction portfolio at December 31, 2018 is as follows. 
 
 
 | Amount | | Percent | 
--------------------------------------------+------------------------+---------+---------+------
 | (Dollars in thousands) | 
Condominium | $ | 135,672 | | 19.7 | %
One- to four-family residential real estate | | 39,759 | | 5.8 | 
Apartment | | 120,569 | | 17.6 | 
Commercial real estate | | 83,341 | | 12.1 | 
Mixed use | | 42,956 | | 6.3 | 
Accommodations | | 65,252 | | 9.5 | 
Retail | | 58,061 | | 8.5 | 
Office building | | 77,048 | | 11.2 | 
Land | | 42,829 | | 6.2 | 
Other | | 21,461 | | 3.1 | 
 | $ | 686,948 | | 100.0 | %

 
Our largest construction loan relationship at December 31, 2018 totaled $52.1 million. This relationship is secured by industrial/warehouse and office properties. The next largest construction borrowing relationship at December 31, 2018 was for $39.9 million and is secured by hotel properties. The third largest construction loan relationship was for $29.8 million. This relationship is secured by mixed use residential and commercial properties. At December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2018, commercial and industrial loans were $625.0 million, or 11.1% of our total loan portfolio, and we intend to increase the amount of commercial and industrial loans that we originate. A significant portion of our commercial and industrial loans consists of our direct purchase of tax-exempt bonds issued by non-profit organizations (primarily educational and health organizations) and manufacturers through programs sponsored by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the states of Maine and New Hampshire. We underwrite these bonds in substantially the same manner as our other commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2018, tax exempt bonds included in our commercial and industrial loan portfolio were $344.8 million, or 55.2% of our total commercial and industrial loans at that date. A portion of our commercial and industrial loans is secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. We make commercial and industrial loans primarily in our market area to a variety of professionals, sole proprietorships, nonprofit organizations and small businesses. However, the primary source of repayment for all of our commercial and industrial loans is income from the underlying business. As part of our relationship driven focus, we generally require our commercial and industrial borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which enhances our interest rate spread and overall profitability.

Commercial lending products include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial loans and lines of credit are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates are based on the Prime Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Initial rates on fixed-rate business loans are generally based on a corresponding U.S. Treasury or Federal Home Loan Bank rate, plus a margin. Commercial and industrial loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans, but may involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses and non-profit entities that operate in our market area and generally originate loans to one borrower up to $65.0 million. 
 When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities of the borrower, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, primarily real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. Depending on the collateral used to secure the loans, commercial loans are made in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. All of these loans are secured by assets of the respective borrowers. 
 Our largest single commercial and industrial loan relationship at December 31, 2018 totaled $60.9 million. This loan is secured by gross receipts. Our next largest borrowing relationship at December 31, 2018 was for $41.9 million and is secured by an assisted living facility. The third largest relationship was for $37.7 million at December 31, 2018 and is unsecured. At December 31, 2018, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms. 
 Home Equity Lines of Credit. We offer home equity lines of credit, which are secured by one- to four-family residences. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance owed on home equity lines of credit amounted to $50.1 million, or 0.9% of our total loan portfolio. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest with five to ten-year draws and 15 to 20 year terms that are indexed to the Prime Rate as published by The Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the month. Our home equity lines either have a monthly variable interest rate or an interest rate that is fixed for five years and then adjusts in years six and 11. We offer home equity lines of credit with cumulative loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80%, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loans and first mortgage loan. 
 The procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral to the proposed loan amount. The procedures for underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans apply equally to home equity loans. 
 Consumer Loans. We offer automobile loans, loans secured by savings or certificate accounts, credit builder, annuity and overdraft loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer loans were $11.0 million, or 0.2% of total loans. The procedures for underwriting consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is a primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, to the proposed loan amount. 
Loan Underwriting Risks 
 Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgage loans, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential loans.

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20x. An environmental phase one report is obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property the value of which is insufficient to assure full payment. 
 Construction Loans. Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations. All speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers. 
 Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, during the term of a construction loan, interest is funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. A discounted cash flow analysis is utilized for determining the value of any construction project of five or more units. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the strength of the housing market in our market areas. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial and industrial loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of real estate, accounts receivable, inventory or equipment. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. Further, any collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. 
 Consumer Loans. Consumer loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by assets that depreciate rapidly, such as motor vehicles. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and a small remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are likely to be adversely affected by various factors, including job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.

Loan Originations, Purchase and Sales
Loan originations come from a variety of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are current customers, business development by our relationship managers, walk-in traffic, our website, advertising and referrals from customers as well as our directors, business owners, investors, entrepreneurs, builders, realtors, existing customers and other professional third parties, including brokers. Loan originations are further supported by lending services offered through our internet website, direct mail, cross-selling, and employees’ community service. We also advertise in newspapers that are widely circulated throughout our market area and on local radio and television. We also participate in loans with others to supplement our origination efforts. We generally do not purchase whole loans. 
 We generally originate loans for our portfolio; however, we generally agree to sell to the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed-rate, 10- to 30-year one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our decision to sell loans is based on prevailing market interest rate conditions and interest rate risk management. We sell residential real estate loans in the secondary market primarily with servicing released. We also sell loans to Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Bank Mortgage Partnership Finance Program and other investors with servicing retained. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we originated $31.1 million and $42.7 million of residential real estate loans for sale, respectively, and sold $34.5 million and $45.0 million of residential real estate loans, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we were servicing $117.5 million of residential real estate loans for other financial institutions. In addition, we sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans to local financial institutions, primarily on the portion of loans exceeding our borrowing limits, or as is prudent in concert with recognition of credit risk. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Bank’s Board of Directors and management. The Bank’s Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Residential loans below $2.0 million require approval by members of senior management.  Residential loans in excess of $2.0 million must be authorized by the Bank’s Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. Commercial loans below $2.5 million require approval by members of senior management. Commercial loans from $2.5 million up to $3.5 million require approval by management’s loan committee, comprised of members of senior management, with at least two affirmative votes from executive officers. Commercial loans in excess of $3.5 million must be authorized by the Bank’s Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. Exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority, either an individual officer or the appropriate management or Board committee prior to commitment. All exceptions are reported to the Board of Directors monthly. 
Loans-to-One Borrower Limit and Loan Category Concentration 
 The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20% of our capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. At December 31, 2018, our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower was $122.6 million. At that date, our largest lending relationship consisted of 11 loans for $81.8 million and was secured by office and industrial buildings. These loans were performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2018. 
Loan Commitments 
 We issue commitments for fixed- and adjustable-rate loans conditioned upon the occurrence of certain events. Commitments to originate loans are legally binding agreements to lend to our customers provided there are no violations of any contractually established conditions. Generally, our commitments to originate loans expire after 60 days. Unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Our lines of credit usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we are committed. Our letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party, primarily to support borrowing arrangements.

Investment Activities 
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential mortgage-backed securities and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB”), certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities, including common stock and money market mutual funds. Our equity securities generally pay dividends. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock, which investment is based on the level of our FHLB borrowings. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2018. 
 At December 31, 2018, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of municipal bonds, investment-grade marketable equity securities and mortgage-backed securities. 
 Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish and maintain an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide a use of funds when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors and management are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Executive Committee reviews the status of our investment portfolio monthly. 
 Each reporting period, we evaluate debt securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) exists. OTTI is required to be recognized if (1) we intend to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For impaired debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as OTTI through earnings. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and non-credit-related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes. Effective January 1, 2018, marketable equity securities are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in net income.
 Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits, borrowings and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions. 
 Deposit Accounts. The substantial majority of our depositors reside in our market area. Deposits are attracted by advertising and through our website, primarily from within our market area through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer several commercial checking accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area and accept brokered deposits and deposits obtained through a listing service when it’s deemed cost effective. 
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. 
 Borrowings. We may utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to supplement our supply of investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2018, we had $335.5 million of available borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, including an available line of credit of $9.4 million at an interest rate that adjusts daily. All of our borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by investment securities and qualified collateral, including one- to four-family loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans held in the Bank’s portfolio.

Financial Services
We exited the financial services industry effective December 31, 2017. Prior to that time, we offered customers a range of non-deposit financial products, including mutual funds, annuities, stocks and bonds which are offered and cleared by a third-party broker-dealer. We received a portion of the commissions generated by sales to our customers. We also offered customers long-term care insurance through a third-party insurance company, which generated commissions for us. Our non-deposit financial products generated $212,000 and $255,000 of non-interest income during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Personnel 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 462 full-time and 87 part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our working relationship with our employees is good. 
Subsidiaries and Affiliates 
 The Bank’s subsidiaries include Prospect, Inc., which engages in securities transactions on its own behalf; EBOSCO, LLC which holds foreclosed real estate; and East Boston Investment Services, Inc., which is authorized for third-party investment sales and is currently inactive. 
Supervision and Regulation 
 General 
 The Bank is a Massachusetts-charted stock savings bank. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and by the Depositors Insurance Fund for amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. 
 The regulation and supervision of the Bank establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers and, for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the protection of the insurance fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 As a bank holding company, the Company is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the Company and the Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve Board. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company and the Bank. 
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to the Bank and the Company. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company.

Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision 
 The Bank, as a Massachusetts savings bank, is regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock or to undertake many other activities. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. 
 In 2015, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts adopted a law modernizing the Massachusetts banking law, which affords Massachusetts chartered banks with greater flexibility. 
 The powers that Massachusetts-chartered savings banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Lending Activities. A Massachusetts-chartered savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 
 Insurance Sales. Massachusetts banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Customers of the Bank are offered certain insurance products through a third party. 
 Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank’s deposits. Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may in addition invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in the Commonwealth which have pledged to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. At the present time, the Bank’s authority under Massachusetts law to invest in equity securities is constrained by federal law. See “—Federal Bank Regulation—Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions. 
 Dividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare from net profits cash dividends not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts savings bank with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banks, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. Net profits for this purpose means the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. 
 Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements, which are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under “—Federal Bank Regulation—Privacy Regulations,” that require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices. 
 Parity Regulation. A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law and regulations issued by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. In some cases, a Massachusetts bank is required to submit advanced written notice to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks prior to engaging in certain activities authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or out-of-state banks. 
 14

Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank’s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the bank’s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. 
 Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the Bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the Bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to the Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 
 Depositors Insurance Fund. All Massachusetts-chartered savings banks are required to be members of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks a risk-based assessment on deposits balances in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 Massachusetts has other statutes and regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below. 
 Federal Bank Regulation 
 Capital Requirements. Under applicable federal regulations, federally insured depository institutions, including state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (“state non-member banks”), such as the Bank, are required to comply with minimum capital requirements. The regulations require insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. 
 Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Institutions that have not exercised the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank elected to exercise its option to opt-out. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  
 15

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, along with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
 Legislation enacted in May 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of assets.  Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirement and electing to follow the alternative framework would be deemed to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The federal regulators have issued a proposed rule that would set the ratio at 9%.
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. Most recently, the agencies have established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Investment Activities. All state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured banks, including savings banks, are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state chartered banks may, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange or the NASDAQ Global Market and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100.0% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law, whichever is less. The Bank received approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to retain and acquire such equity instruments equal to the lesser of 100% of the Bank’s Tier 1 capital or the maximum permissible amount specified by Massachusetts law. Such grandfathered authority may be terminated under certain circumstances including a determination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that such investments pose a safety and soundness risk. 
 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks are permitted to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis to the extent that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 16

An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was classified as a “well capitalized” institution. 
 “Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Bank’s Regulation O place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Regulation O, loans to a director, executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% stockholder of a financial institution, and certain of their affiliated interests, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Regulation O also requires that, subject to an exception for certain bank-wide employee programs, loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms and conditions substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to persons who are not insiders. Regulation O also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Additional restrictions apply to loans to executive officers. 
 Enforcement. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including the Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance. 
 17

Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes deposit insurance assessments. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions of less than $10 billion in total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was required to seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November 2018. Insured institutions of less than $10 billion of assets will receive credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.  
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
 In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in the third quarter of 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 Privacy Regulations. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations generally require that the Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, the Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, a non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. The Bank’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was “Satisfactory.” 
 Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to the Bank. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. The Bank’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.”

Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Massachusetts savings banks are subject to a variety of federal and Massachusetts statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. 
 USA Patriot Act. The Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;

Federal Reserve System 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require for 2019 that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0% and the amounts greater than $124.2 million require a 10.0% reserve (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements.

Federal Home Loan Bank System
The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2018. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. The Bank reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. As of December 31, 2018, no impairment has been recognized. 
 At its discretion, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on the stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including the resolution of insolvent thrifts in the late 1980s and to contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. As a result of losses incurred, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston suspended and did not pay dividends in 2009 and 2010. However, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston resumed payment of quarterly dividends in 2011 and, for 2018, paid dividends with an annual yield of 5.56%. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future. Further, there can be no assurance that the impact of recent or future legislation on the Federal Home Loan Banks also will not cause a decrease in the value of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock held by the Bank. 
 Holding Company 
 The Company is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. 
 The Company is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy requirements for bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. The Company was in compliance with the consolidated capital requirements as of December 31, 2018. 
 20

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance which requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank holding company’s payment of dividends or repurchase of its stock under certain circumstances.  These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default. 
 The status of the Company as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 
 Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the Bank Holding Company Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. 
Federal Securities Laws 
 The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.

Change in Control Regulations 
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Taxation 
 The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. 
Federal Taxation 
 General. The Company reports its income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting. The federal income tax laws apply to the Company in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including the reserve for bad debts discussed below. The Company’s federal income tax returns have been either audited or closed under the statute of limitations through December 31, 2013. For its 2017 tax year, the Bank’s maximum federal income tax rate was 35%. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017, the Company’s federal income tax rate was reduced to 21% beginning January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company incurred a $7.1 million charge in 2017 related to the revaluation of its net deferred tax asset.
 Bad Debt Reserves. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for non-qualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and required savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. However, those bad debt reserves accumulated prior to 1988 (“Base Year Reserves”) were not required to be recaptured unless the savings institution failed certain tests. At December 31, 2018, $9.8 million of the Bank’s accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless the Bank makes a “non-dividend distribution” to the Company as described below. 
 Distributions. If the Bank makes “non-dividend distributions” to the Company, the distributions will be considered to have been made from the Bank’s un-recaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of its Base Year Reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the “non-dividend distributions,” and then from the Bank’s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in the Bank’s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of the Bank’s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in the Company’s taxable income. 
 The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if the Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the Company, approximately one and one-third times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves. 
 22

State Taxation. Financial institutions in Massachusetts are generally required to file combined income tax returns. The Massachusetts excise tax rate for savings banks is 9.0% of federal taxable income, adjusted for certain items. Taxable income includes gross income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, plus interest from bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state, including Massachusetts, less deductions, but not the credits, allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except for those deductions relating to dividends received and income or franchise taxes imposed by a state or political subdivision. Carryforwards and carrybacks of net operating losses and capital losses are not allowed. The Company’s state tax returns, as well as those of its subsidiaries, are not currently under audit. 
 A financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security corporation” under Massachusetts law provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding securities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (b) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security corporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is also a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 0.33% of its gross income. A security corporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its gross income. Prospect, Inc. is qualified as a security corporation. As such, it has received security corporation classification by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue; and does not conduct any activities deemed impermissible under the governing statutes and the various regulations, directives, letter rulings and administrative pronouncements issued by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
