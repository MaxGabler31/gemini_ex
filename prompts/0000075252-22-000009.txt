Item 1. Business 
General
Owens & Minor, Inc. and subsidiaries (we, us, our or the Company), a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a global healthcare solutions company that incorporates product manufacturing, distribution support and innovative technology services to deliver significant and sustained value across the breadth of the industry – from acute care to patients in their home. Our teammates serve healthcare industry customers in approximately 70 countries, by providing quality products and helping to reduce total costs across the healthcare supply chain by optimizing point-of care performance, freeing up capital and clinical resources and managing contracts to optimize financial performance. The description of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data included in this Form 10-K. 
 Founded in 1882, Owens & Minor was incorporated in 1926 and has operated continuously from its Richmond, Virginia headquarters. Through organic growth and acquisitions over many years, we significantly expanded and strengthened our company, achieving international scale in the healthcare market. Today, we have distribution, production, storage, customer service and sales facilities located across Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America and the United States.
On June 18, 2020, we completed the divestiture of our European logistics business, Movianto (the Divestiture), as well as certain support functions in our Dublin office, to Walden Group SAS (the Buyer) and EHDH (as Buyer’s guarantor) for cash consideration of $133 million. See Note 3, “Discontinued Operations,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for further information. Unless otherwise indicated, the following information relates to continuing operations. 
On January 7, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire Apria, Inc. (Apria) for $37.50 in cash per share of common stock, representing an equity value of approximately $1.45 billion, as well as the assumption of debt and cash for a total transaction value of approximately $1.6 billion. Apria is a provider of integrated home healthcare equipment and related services in the United States. The Agreement and Plan of Merger contains certain termination rights for the Company and Apria. In the event that Apria terminates the contract for a superior proposal, Apria will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $42.0 million. The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, is subject to customary closing conditions, including the Hart Scott Rodino Act and other regulatory approvals and the approval of Apria’s stockholders, and is expected to close during the first half of 2022.
Global Solutions
In our Global Solutions segment, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to healthcare providers and manufacturers. Our portfolio of medical and surgical supplies includes branded products purchased from manufacturers and our own proprietary products. We store our products at our distribution centers and provide delivery of these products, along with related services, to healthcare providers around the nation.
Our service offerings to healthcare providers include supplier management, analytics, inventory management, and clinical supply management. These value-add services help providers improve their processes for contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies and streamlining inventory. These services include our operating room-focused inventory management program that helps healthcare providers manage suture and endo-mechanical inventory, as well as our customizable surgical supply service that includes the kitting and delivery of surgical supplies in procedure-based totes to coincide with the healthcare providers' surgical schedule. 
In addition to services to healthcare providers, we offer a variety of programs dedicated to providing outsourced logistics and marketing solutions to our suppliers as well. These are designed to help manufacturers drive sales growth, increase market share and achieve operational efficiencies. Manufacturer programs are generally negotiated on an annual basis and provide for enhanced levels of support that are aligned with the manufacturer’s annual objectives and growth goals. We have contractual arrangements with manufacturers participating in these programs that provide performance-based incentives to us, as well as cash discounts for prompt payment. Program incentives can be earned on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
We operate a network of 44 distribution centers located throughout the United States, which are strategically located to efficiently serve our provider and manufacturer customers. A significant investment in information technology supports our business including warehouse management systems, customer service and ordering functions, demand forecasting programs, electronic commerce, data warehousing, decision support and supply-chain management. 
We customize product deliveries, whether the orders are “just-in-time,” “low-unit-of-measure,” pallets, or truckloads. We also customize delivery schedules according to customers’ needs to increase their efficiency in receiving and storing products. We use low-unit-of-measure automated picking modules in our larger distribution centers to maximize efficiency, and our distribution center teammates use voice-pick technology to enhance speed and accuracy in performing certain warehousing processes. We partner with a third party company to deliver most supplies in the United States. We also use contract carriers and parcel delivery services when they are more cost-effective and timely.
The majority of our distribution arrangements compensate us on a cost-plus percentage basis, under which a negotiated percentage mark-up is added to the contract cost of the product agreed to by the supplier and customer or Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). We price our services for other arrangements under activity-based pricing models. In these cases, pricing depends upon the type, level and/or complexity of services that we provide to customers, and in some cases we do not take title to the product (although we maintain certain custodial risks). As a result, this fee-for-service pricing model aligns the fees we charge with the cost of the services provided, which is a component of distribution, selling and administrative expenses, rather than with the cost of the product, which is a component of cost of goods sold.
Patient Direct expands our business along the continuum of care through delivery of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies. Patient Direct specializes in various patient care product lines including diabetes, ostomy, wound care, urology, incontinence and other. We receive payments for products sold through Patient Direct from managed care plans, the U.S. federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, private insurers and directly from patients. Patient Direct has a nationwide sales force, focusing on managed care and key referral sources, six centers of excellence aligned with specific product categories, and a nationwide network to optimize shipping distance and time.
Certain assets, liabilities and contracts of Fusion5 were sold on December 31, 2020. The sold assets and liabilities were not included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020. This business did not qualify as discontinued operations and, accordingly, its financial results were included in income from continuing operations during 2020 and 2021.
Global Products
Our Global Products segment manufactures and sources medical surgical products through our production and kitting operations. We provide medical supplies and solutions for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections across the acute and alternate site channels. 
Our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, Honduras, Mexico and Ireland. Our business has recognized brands across its portfolio of product offerings, including sterilization wrap, surgical drapes and gowns, facial protection, protective apparel, medical exam gloves, custom and minor procedure kits and other medical products. We use a wide variety of raw materials and other inputs in our production processes, with polypropylene polymers and nitrile constituting our most significant raw material purchases. We base our purchasing decisions on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Global commodity prices can affect pricing of certain raw materials on which we rely. In our Halyard product line, polypropylene polymers, which are oil based, and nitrile represent a significant component of our manufacturing costs. In addition, the prices of other raw materials we use, such as resins and finishing supplies, often fluctuate in response to changes in oil prices. 
We support customer sales through a dedicated global sales force and direct our primary sales and marketing efforts toward hospitals and other healthcare providers to highlight the unique benefits and competitive differentiation of our products. We work directly with physicians, nurses, professional societies, hospital administrators and GPOs to collaborate and educate on emerging practices and clinical techniques that prevent infection and speed recovery. These marketing programs are delivered directly to healthcare providers. Additionally, we provide marketing programs to our strategic distribution partners throughout the world. We operate four major distribution centers located in North America and Asia that ship multiple finished products to multiple customers, as well as other distribution sites that also have customer shipping capabilities, in order to optimize cost and customer service requirements. 
Our proprietary products are typically purchased pursuant to purchase orders or supply agreements in which the purchaser specifies whether such products are to be supplied through a distributor or directly. This segment may sell on an intercompany basis to our Global Solutions segment when we are the designated distributor, to other third-party distributors or directly to healthcare providers.
Our Customers 
We currently provide products and services to thousands of healthcare provider customers either directly or indirectly through third-party distributors. These customers include multi-facility networks of healthcare providers offering a broad spectrum of healthcare services to a particular market or markets as well as smaller, independent hospitals. In addition to contracting directly with healthcare providers at the Integrated Delivery Network (IDN) level, we also contract with GPOs as well as other types of healthcare providers including surgery centers, physicians’ practices and smaller networks of hospitals that have joined together to negotiate terms. We have contracts to provide distribution services to the members of a number of national GPOs, including Vizient, Premier, Inc. (Premier) and HealthTrust Purchasing Group (HPG). Below is a summary of these agreements: 
GPO | Year of Renewal or Extension | Term | Sales to Members as a % of Consolidated Net Revenue in 2021
Vizient | 2021 | 2 years | 34% 
Premier | 2021 | 5 years | 22% 
HPG(1) | 2021 | 8 months | 15% 

(1) The HPG contract was extended through April 2022. We expect this contract to be extended on a longer-term basis in early 2022.
We have our own independent relationships with most of our hospital customers through separate contractual commitments that may or may not be based upon the terms of our agreement with the GPO. As a result, the termination or expiration of an agreement with a particular GPO would not necessarily mean that we would lose the members of such GPO as our customers. Through our Patient Direct business, we also provide delivery of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies.
Our suppliers represent the largest and most influential healthcare manufacturers in the industry. We have long-term relationships with these important companies in the healthcare supply chain and have long provided traditional distribution services to them. In the Global Solutions segment, no sales of products from any individual suppliers exceeded 10% of our consolidated net revenue for 2021. 
Asset Management
In our business, a significant investment in inventory and accounts receivable is required to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers and provide high-quality service. As a result, efficient asset management is essential to our profitability. We continually work to refine our processes to optimize inventory and collect accounts receivable. 
Inventory 
We actively monitor inventory for obsolescence and use inventory days and other operational metrics to measure our performance in managing inventory. We are focused in our efforts to optimize inventory and continually consolidate products and collaborate with suppliers on inventory productivity initiatives. When we convert large-scale IDN customers to our distribution network, an additional investment in inventory in advance of expected sales is generally required. 
Accounts Receivable 
In the normal course of business, we provide credit to our customers and use credit management techniques to evaluate customers’ creditworthiness and facilitate collection. These techniques may include performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers based primarily on financial information provided by them and from sources available to the general public. We also use third-party information from sources such as credit reporting agencies, banks and other credit references. We actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk, days sales outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivable carrying costs. Our ability to accurately invoice and ship product to customers enhances our collection results and affects our DSO performance. As we diversify our customer portfolio, the change in business mix also affects our DSO. We have arrangements with certain customers under which they make deposits on account, either because they do not meet our standards for creditworthiness or in order to obtain more favorable pricing. 
Competition
 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Global Solutions competitors include two major nationwide manufacturers who also provide distribution services, Cardinal Health, Inc. and Medline Industries, Inc. In addition, we compete with a number of regional and local distributors, companies that distribute products to patients' homes and customer self-distribution models. Major outsourced logistics competitors serving healthcare manufacturers in the United States include United Parcel Service and FedEx Corporation.
The major competitors of our Global Products business include Cardinal Health, Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Hogy Medical, Multigate Medical Products, Mölnlycke Health Care and HARTMANN Group. In the United States, several of our distribution partners and GPOs are also competitors or are increasingly seeking to compete with us by direct sourcing their own products. We compete against reusable products, or low usage of infection prevention products, due in large part to limited awareness and education on infection prevention practices and products. The highly competitive environment requires us to seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. Our products face competition from other brands that may be less expensive than our products and from other companies that may have more resources than we do. Competitive factors include price, alternative clinical practices, innovation, quality and reputation. To successfully compete, we must demonstrate that our products offer higher quality, more innovative features or better value versus other products.
Research and Development
We continuously engage in research and development to commercialize new products and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of our existing products. In our Global Products business, we are focused on maintaining our market position by providing innovative customer-preferred product enhancements, with a particular focus on the operating room. Leveraging customer insights and our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities, we seek to continuously improve our product designs, specifications and features to deliver cost efficiencies while improving healthcare worker and patient protection. We continuously refresh our surgical drape and gown portfolio to ensure that our products are aligned with the latest medical and procedural standards. Our research team works with healthcare providers to develop and design exam glove and apparel portfolios that optimize comfort and fit and provide cost-effective infection prevention solutions for use throughout the hospital. We are also investing in new categories and solutions that complement our technical expertise and existing intellectual property. We are particularly focused on those new categories that we believe will leverage our existing scalable technology platforms as well as our sales and marketing expertise.
Intellectual Property
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to the growth of our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position.
On a regular basis, we review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property owned by others.
We have approximately 940 patents and patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to the technology used in many of our products. We utilize patents in our surgical and infection protection products and currently have approximately 140 issued patents in the U.S. and approximately 600 issued patents in countries outside the U.S. These patents generally expire between 2022 and 2040. We do not license any patents from third parties that are material to our business.
We also file patent applications for innovative product lines and solutions that result from our technical expertise. In order to protect our ongoing research & development investments, we have approximately 40 pending patent applications in the U.S. and approximately 170 pending patent applications in countries outside of the U.S.
With respect to trademarks, we have approximately 1,100 trademarks and trademark applications pending in the United States and other countries that are used to designate or identify our company or products. We have approximately 130 U.S. registration trademarks and approximately 840 registered trademarks outside of the U.S. We also have approximately 50 pending trademark applications in the U.S. and approximately 100 pending trademark applications outside of the U.S.
We distribute products bearing the well-known “Halyard” brand. Other well-known registered trademarks we use include: Aero Blue, Quick Check, Smart-Fold, One Step, Purple, Purple Nitrile, Purple Nitrile-Xtra, Lavender, Sterling, and Safeskin.
We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products, as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark.
Regulation
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products, as well as the provision of logistics and services in the healthcare industry are subject to comprehensive regulation by federal, state and local government agencies. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, globally, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices.
Our operations are impacted by trade regulations in many countries that govern the import of raw materials and finished products, as well as data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation) that require safeguards for the protection of healthcare and other personal data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) as well as laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. 
We must also comply with laws and regulations, including those governing operations, storage, transportation, manufacturing, sales, safety and security standards for each of our manufacturing and distribution centers, of the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and state boards of pharmacy, or similar state licensing boards and regulatory agencies. 
We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws directed at regulating reimbursement of our products and services under various government programs and preventing fraud and abuse. We maintain certain safeguards intended to reduce the likelihood that we will engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in violation of these restrictions. Legal department personnel review and approve written contracts, such as agreements with physicians, subject to these laws. Notwithstanding these measures, violations of these laws and regulations may still occur, which could subject us to civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe fines and penalties; the repayment of amounts previously paid to us; and even the termination of our ability to provide services under certain government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to local, country and European-wide regulations, including those promulgated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medical Devices Directive. In addition, quality requirements are imposed by healthcare industry manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies which audit our operations on a regular basis. Each of our manufacturing locations are licensed or registered with the appropriate local authority. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, as well as prevailing industry best practices, in the conduct of our business operations outside of the United States.
Since we market our products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action. Demand for many of our existing and new medical devices is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels. From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business, and the federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing reimbursement levels for medical expenses paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products, their ability to pay and the prices they are willing to pay.
Governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose substantial costs on us. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations.
Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to 
market newly developed and existing products. We believe we are in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations.
Human Capital Resources
Teammate Overview
At Owens & Minor, teammates are at the heart of everything that we do. Through their creativity, talent and hard work, our teammates allow us to offer exceptional products and services and provide the force that propels our mission to empower our customers to advance healthcare. Thus, we are committed to providing a culture and benefits necessary to attract and retain top talent. We are also committed to creating an environment that allows our teammates to perform at a high level, emphasizes a culture of safety and is conducive to professional and personal growth. 
At the end of 2021, we employed approximately 6,900 full- and part-time teammates in the U.S. and 10,400 teammates outside of the U.S. None of our domestic teammates are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”), but certain teammates outside the U.S. (OUS) are represented and covered by a CBA. Throughout our operations, we continue to have positive relationships with our teammates, as well as the unions and works councils that represent our OUS teammates.
We depend on our key personnel to successfully operate our business, including our executive officers, senior corporate management and management at our operating segments. We seek to attract and retain top talent for these critical roles by offering competitive base and incentive compensation packages (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits and opportunities for advancement and rewarding careers. We periodically review and adjust, if needed, our teammates’ total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives, and benefits) to ensure that our offerings are competitive within the industry and consistent with our performance. We have also implemented enterprise-wide talent development and succession planning programs designed to identify future and/or replacement candidates for key positions. In addition to compensation, we promote numerous charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs that not only support the communities we serve, but also provide experiences for teammates to promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment.
In order to take advantage of available opportunities and successfully implement our long-term strategy, we understand that we must be able to employ, train and retain the necessary skilled personnel. To that end, we support and utilize various training and educational initiatives, and we have developed Company-wide and project-specific teammate training and educational programs. Key programs focus on teammate safety, leadership development, health and wellness, work-life balance, talent management, diversity and inclusion, and teammate engagement. At Owens & Minor, we believe that diversity, inclusion, and teammate engagement are integral to our vision, strategy and business success, and we pride ourselves on sustaining a culture that respects teammates and values concern for others. We believe that fostering an environment that values diversity, inclusion and ethical conduct creates an organization that is able to embrace, leverage and respect differences among our teammates, customers and the communities where we live, work and serve. As a result, we created Teammate Resource Groups (TRGs) that provide resources and support for underrepresented identity groups to improve innovation, promote belonging, increase team alignment, and boost engagement. Our current TRGs include Black Heritage, Outreach, Mentorship and Enrichment, Asian Pacific Islanders Rising to Excellence, Hispanic Organization for Leadership and Achievement, LGBTQ+, Military and Veteran, Women Empowerment Network, and Women in Tech. In addition, we continue to expand our diversity and inclusion journey by conducting voice forums in an effort to celebrate different cultures. We also believe that our teammates are the face of Owens & Minor, and we expect every teammate to model our shared values and commitment to ethical business practices set forth in our Code of Honor. 
In 2021, we established the Owens & Minor Foundation, which is dedicated to further our commitment towards impactful investments to charitable and civic organizations in the communities we serve and will focus primarily in the three areas of environment, healthcare, diversity and inclusion.
We believe that our efforts to create an environment that is conducive to our values and teammate success have been rewarded. Our values reflect our commitment to our customers, our teammates, the environment and the communities where we live and work. They embody “IDEAL” behavior — Integrity, Development, Excellence, Accountability and Listening. All our teammates are responsible for embodying these values every day. We also hold our teammates to a high standard of performance, and we regularly evaluate teammates’ productivity against current requirements, future demand expectations and historical trends. From time to time, we may add, reduce or adjust resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands.
Our Board of Directors’ Role in Human Capital Resource Management
Our Board of Directors believes that human capital management, and the ability to attract, retain and develop key talent, is an essential component of our continued growth and success. Our Board also believes that effective human capital 
management is vital to maintaining a culture that reflects our core values and our shared commitment to excellence and ethical business practices.
Management regularly reports to the Our People & Culture Committee (previously the Compensation and Benefits Committee) of the Board of Directors on human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, teammate development and compensation and benefits. From time to time, we also conduct teammate engagement surveys to solicit feedback, and provide reports to the Board on findings developed through these surveys. The Our People & Culture Committee has oversight of talent retention and development, including succession planning, and the Board of Directors provides input on important decisions in each of these areas. 
Teammate Benefits
The Our People & Culture Committee believes teammate benefits are an essential component of a competitive total compensation package. Our benefits programs are designed to attract and retain our top talent, and include medical, health and dental insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, life insurance, travel and accident insurance, and our 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan. As part of the 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, we generally match 100 percent of the first 4 percent of compensation contributed by a teammate into the 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and our 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan limits. Additionally, we may make a discretionary contribution (subject to certain limitations as defined in the 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan document) to each participant employed on the last day of the plan year who has worked at least 1,000 hours during the year. Lastly, we may also make a profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. We expensed discretionary contributions of 3% in 2021, 2% in 2020, and none in 2019 of eligible annual earnings.
COVID-19 Response
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented health and safety protocols to protect our teammates and customers. These protocols meet or exceed health and safety standards required by federal, state and local government agencies, and are based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. Actions taken to protect our teammates and customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic include:
•Providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to teammates in distribution and manufacturing locations;
•Training teammates on proper use of PPE, social distancing, and other mitigation efforts;
•Providing paid time off for teammates to receive COVID-19 vaccinations;
•Significantly increased remote work and virtual interactions among teammates and with customers;
•Policies were adjusted to assist teammates that need time away from work due to illness, potential exposure or to care for sick family members; and
•Adjusted product delivery methods to keep drivers and hospital personnel safe.
For additional discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including on our human capital resources, refer to the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
