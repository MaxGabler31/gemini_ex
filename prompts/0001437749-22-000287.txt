ITEM 1
BUSINESS
 
Business Overview
 
Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (“HEI”) conducts all of its homebuilding and financial services operations through its subsidiaries (references herein to the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” refer to HEI and its consolidated subsidiaries and should be understood to reflect the consolidated business of HEI’s subsidiaries). Through its subsidiaries, HEI designs, constructs, markets, and sells single-family detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill, and active lifestyle homes in planned residential developments and is one of the nation’s largest builders of residential homes. Founded in 1959 by Kevork Hovnanian, HEI was incorporated in New Jersey in 1967 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Since the incorporation of HEI’s predecessor company, the Company combined with its unconsolidated joint ventures have delivered in excess of 355,000 homes, including 6,793 homes in fiscal 2021. The Company has two distinct operations: homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations consist of six segments: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. Our financial services operations provide mortgage loans and title services to the customers of our homebuilding operations.
 
We are currently, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, offering homes for sale in 124 communities in 26 markets in 14 states throughout the United States. We market and build homes for first-time buyers, first-time and second-time move-up buyers, luxury buyers, active lifestyle buyers and empty nesters. We offer a variety of home styles at base prices ranging from $173,000 to $1,273,000 with an average sales price, including options, of $431,000 nationwide in fiscal 2021.
 
Our operations span all significant aspects of the home-buying process – from design, construction, and sale, to mortgage origination and title services.

Human Capital
 
As of October 31, 2021, we employed 1,784 full-time associates of whom 1,268 were involved in our Homebuilding operations, 165 were involved in the Financial Services operations and 351 were involved in our Corporate operations.  We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates.
 
Successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key associates and members of our management team. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our team significantly benefit our operations and performance. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase engagement, productivity, efficiency and the skills our associates need to be successful.
 
We believe that talented associates are the Company’s greatest asset and play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of October 31, 2021, 19% of our associates had been with the Company for more than 15 years, and the average tenure of all associates was greater than seven years. We understand that our ultimate success and ability to compete are significantly dependent on how well we identify, hire, train, and retain highly qualified personnel. We realize that each associate has a unique vision and their own special talents. We are committed to being an employer that fosters the growth of each associate, while building an inclusive and diverse workforce.
 
In fiscal 2021, our Accelerated Leadership Development Program (ALDP) formed its second class following the initial success of the 2018 ALDP. The goal of this program is to identify leaders within and outside of the organization (as part of our recruiting efforts) to mentor, in order to drive growth and value creation, as well as considerations for succession planning. We actively seek to attract women and candidates of diverse backgrounds to the ALDP, and we significantly increased the proportion of women and underrepresented groups by 44% with our fiscal 2021 ALDP class.
 
We believe that our focus on diversity and inclusion across the organization positions the Company to deliver innovation and growth. We have a diverse associate base comprised of 28% non-white associates as of October 31, 2021. Additionally, as of October 31, 2021, 44% of our associates were women, and women represent 40% of all associates in manager and more senior positions.
 
Promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment is a major priority at Hovnanian. In 2020, the Company formed a Diversity & Inclusion Committee, which is led by the CEO and comprised of members of senior leadership and associates in various functions throughout the organization representing various backgrounds. The objective of the committee is to advise on and evaluate the Company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives and to offer suggestions and guidance.  The Diversity & Inclusion Committee meets quarterly. All associates are required to take a Diversity Made Simple training course. Associates in leadership positions (representing approximately 20% of all associates) are obligated to participate in more extensive diversity and inclusion training sessions.
 
Hovnanian is also a founding member of the Building Talent Foundation whose mission is to advance the education, training and careers of people from underrepresented groups in the fields of skilled technical workers and as business owners in the residential construction industry.
 
Through a combination of competitive benefits and educational programs, we believe that we positively contribute to the well-being of our associates and the communities in which they live and work. Our benefits packages include medical, dental, and vision coverage, as well as health savings accounts, life insurance, disability income, 401(k) savings plan with a company match and other assistance and wellness programs. Together, these benefits help keep our associates and their dependents healthy, while giving them tax-advantaged ways to save for retirement and establish long-term financial security. This package of programs is routinely reevaluated in order to meet the changing needs of our associates in our diverse organization.
 
From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and throughout, we made the safety of our associates, trade partners and customers our top priority. We were quick to respond with our company wide COVID-19 Prevention, Preparedness & Response Plan and further implemented state-specific COVID-19 plans where required. Our COVID-19 plans were generated and periodically amended following the most current guidance from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as well as state requirements based on the geographic location of our various operations.

During fiscal 2021, in light of the Company’s successful experience managing the remote working environment due to the pandemic and the recognition of the associated environmental benefits, the Company introduced a hybrid work schedule whereby, once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and associates anticipate returning to the office,  most office associates may work two days a week from home. We believe this change to a hybrid work model will promote a healthier work and home life balance for our associates while simultaneously providing the environmental benefits of having fewer vehicles on the road.
 
We also have committed considerable resources to furthering our associates’ personal and professional growth. We have a repository of over 400 training modules/courses to facilitate these learning sessions in both in-person and virtual settings, including mandatory diversity, ethics, sexual harassment and safety training courses.

Business Strategies 
 
Given our belief in the long-term recovery of the homebuilding market, we remain focused on identifying new land parcels, which will allow us to continue to improve our financial performance. For seven consecutive quarters through the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our total number of lots controlled increased as compared to the same period of the prior year. This growth in lot control led to increased community count in fiscal 2019, which along with faster absorption pace per community, allowed us to increase fiscal 2020 deliveries by 15.0% over fiscal 2019, and increased our October 31, 2020 backlog by 55.3% over October 31, 2019. This faster absorption pace continued in fiscal 2021, resulting in a 9.1% increase in deliveries over fiscal 2020 and caused our community count to decrease during the first half of fiscal 2021, however, we have increased our community count in recent months to 124 at October 31, 2021, and expect to continue to grow community count going forward, although it may fluctuate up and down during the first half of fiscal 2022. We continue to see opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense in light of our current sales prices and sales paces and plan to continue actively pursuing such land acquisitions. New land purchases at pricing that we believe will generate appropriate investment returns and drive greater operating efficiencies are needed to sustain profitability. Our continued profitability in fiscal 2021 and our expectations for the future enabled us to reverse a substantial portion of our valuation allowance previously recorded against our deferred tax assets, creating positive equity.
 
We continue to be focused on maintaining adequate liquidity and evaluating new investment opportunities. Our excess liquidity in fiscal 2021 allowed us to repurchase $180.9 million of senior secured notes in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year. In addition to our current focus on liquidity, we intend to continue to focus on our historic key business strategies, as enumerated below. We believe that these strategies separate us from our competitors in the residential homebuilding industry and the adoption, implementation and adherence to these principles will continue to benefit our business.
 
Our goal is to become a significant builder in each of the selected markets in which we operate, which will enable us to achieve powers and economies of scale and differentiate ourselves from most of our competitors.
 
As noted above, we offer a broad product array to provide housing to a wide range of customers. Our customers consist of first-time buyers, first-time and second-time move-up buyers, luxury buyers, active lifestyle buyers and empty nesters. Our diverse product array includes single-family detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill and active lifestyle homes.
 
We are committed to customer satisfaction and quality in the homes that we build. We recognize that our future success rests in the ability to deliver quality homes to satisfied customers. We seek to expand our commitment to customer service through a variety of quality initiatives. In addition, our focus remains on attracting and developing quality associates. See "Human Capital" above for further discussion.
 
We focus on achieving high return on invested capital. Each new community is evaluated based on its ability to meet or exceed internal rate of return requirements. Our belief is that the best way to create lasting value for our shareholders is through a strong focus on return on invested capital.
 
We prefer to use a risk-averse land acquisition strategy. We attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options, thereby limiting the financial exposure to the amounts invested in property and predevelopment costs. This approach significantly reduces our risk and generally allows us to obtain necessary development approvals before acquisition of the land.
 
Our strategy includes homebuilding and land development joint ventures as a means of controlling lot positions, expanding our market opportunities, establishing strategic alliances, reducing our risk profile, leveraging our capital base and enhancing our returns on capital. Our homebuilding joint ventures are generally entered into with third-party investors to develop land and construct homes that are sold directly to home buyers. Our land development joint ventures include those with developers and other homebuilders, as well as financial investors to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture’s members or other third parties.
 
We manage our financial services operations to better serve all of our home buyers. Our current mortgage financing and title service operations enhance our contact with customers and allow us to coordinate the home-buying experience from beginning to end.

Operating Policies and Procedures
 
We attempt to reduce the effect of certain risks inherent in the housing industry through the following policies and procedures:
 
Training - Our training is designed to provide our associates with the knowledge, attitudes, skills and habits necessary to succeed in their jobs. Our training department regularly conducts in-person, online or webinar training in sales, construction, administration and managerial skills.
Land Acquisition, Planning, and Development - Before entering into a contract to acquire land, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of such land acquisition. We generally follow a policy of acquiring options to purchase land for future community developments.

● | Where possible, we acquire land for future development through the use of land options, which need not be exercised before the completion of the regulatory approval process. We attempt to structure these options with flexible takedown schedules rather than with an obligation to take down the entire parcel upon receiving regulatory approval. If we are unable to negotiate flexible takedown schedules, we will buy parcels in a single bulk purchase. Additionally, we purchase improved lots in certain markets by acquiring a small number of improved lots with an option on additional lots. This allows us to minimize the economic costs and risks of carrying a large land inventory, while maintaining our ability to commence new developments during favorable market periods. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our option and purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions, including, but not limited to, our ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community. Generally, the deposit on the agreement will be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained, although predevelopment costs may not be recoverable. By paying an additional nonrefundable deposit, we have the right to extend a significant number of our options for varying periods of time. In most instances, we have the right to cancel any of our land option agreements by forfeiture of our deposit on the agreement. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, rather than purchase additional lots in underperforming communities, we took advantage of this right and walked away from 3,201 lots, 3,900 lots and 5,153 lots, respectively, out of 23,624 total lots, 20,204 total lots and 23,157 total lots, respectively, under option, resulting in pretax charges of $1.6 million, $6.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively.

Design - Our residential communities are generally located in urban and suburban areas easily accessible through public and personal transportation. Our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics. We strive to create diversity within the overall planned community by offering a mix of homes with differing architecture, textures and colors. Recreational amenities, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, clubhouses, open areas and tot lots, are frequently included.
Construction - We design and supervise the development and building of our communities. Our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes, which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction. We generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and construction of homes. Agreements with subcontractors are generally short term and provide for a fixed price for labor and materials. We rigorously control costs through the use of computerized monitoring systems.
 
Because of the risks involved in speculative building, our general policy is to construct an attached condominium or townhouse building only after signing contracts for the sale of at least 50% of the homes in that building. A majority of our single-family detached homes are constructed after the signing of a sales contract and mortgage approval has been obtained. This limits the buildup of inventory of unsold homes and the costs of maintaining and carrying that inventory.
 
Materials and Subcontractors - We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources. In addition, we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes. We have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have experienced construction delays due to shortages in the supply of materials, as well as labor shortages in all of our markets. The impact and the particular materials associated with the delays is varied from market to market, and we are currently experiencing increased construction cycle times by 45-60 days in many of our markets, but such timeframes could be elongated. We cannot predict the extent to which shortages in necessary materials or labor will continue or re-occur in our markets in the future.
Marketing and Sales - Our homes in residential communities are sold principally through on-site sales offices. In order to respond to our customers’ needs and trends in housing design, we rely upon our internal market research group to analyze information gathered from, among other sources, buyer profiles, exit interviews at model sites, focus groups and demographic databases. We make use of our website, internet, newspaper, radio, television, magazine, billboard, video and direct mail advertising, special and promotional events, illustrated brochures and full-sized and scale model homes in our comprehensive marketing program. In addition, we have home design galleries in our Florida, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia markets, which offer a wide range of customer options to satisfy individual customer tastes. 
 
In fiscal 2019, we established a national call center which is responsible for follow up generated by our web site and our digital marketing efforts. This call center continues to be a critical sales tool since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The call center supports our ability to swiftly respond to incoming customer leads, schedule and conduct virtual tours and video chats, as well as set up in person model home tours.
 
Customer Service and Quality Control - In many of our markets, associates are responsible for customer service and preclosing quality control inspections as well as responding to post-closing customer needs. Prior to closing, each home is inspected and any necessary completion work is undertaken by us or our subcontractors. Our homes are enrolled in a standard limited warranty program which, in general, provides a homebuyer with a limited warranty for the home’s materials and workmanship which follows each state’s applicable statute of repose. All of the warranties contain standard exceptions, including, but not limited to, damage caused by the customer.
Customer Financing - We sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages. Our financial services segment provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application, loan approval, and closing and title services. We originate loans in each of the states in which we build homes. We believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales.

During the year ended October 31, 2021, for the markets in which our mortgage subsidiaries originated loans, 8.5% of our home buyers paid in cash and 68.3% of our noncash home buyers obtained mortgages from our mortgage banking subsidiary. The loans we originated in fiscal 2021 were 71.9% prime and 27.4% Federal Housing Administration/Veterans Affairs (“FHA/VA”). The remaining 0.7% of our loan originations represent loans which exceed conforming conventions.
 
We sell virtually all of the loans and loan-servicing rights that we originate within a short period of time. Loans are sold either individually or against forward commitments to institutional investors, including banks, mortgage banking firms, and savings and loan associations.
 
Residential Development Activities
 
Our residential development activities include site planning and engineering, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads, sewer, water, and drainage facilities, recreational facilities, and other amenities and marketing and selling homes. These activities are performed by our associates, together with independent architects, consultants and contractors. Our associates also carry out long-term planning of communities. A residential development generally includes single-family detached homes and/or a number of residential buildings containing from two to 24 individual homes per building, together with amenities, such as club houses, swimming pools, tennis courts, tot lots and open areas.
 
Current base prices for our homes in contract backlog at October 31, 2021, range from $578,000 to $1,200,000 in the Northeast, from $220,000 to $1,120,000 in the Mid-Atlantic, from $173,000 to $680,000 in the Midwest, from $251,000 to $1,273,000 in the Southeast, from $239,000 to $803,000 in the Southwest and from $308,000 to $1,063,000 in the West. Closings generally occur and are typically reflected in revenues within six to nine months of when sales contracts are signed.
 
Information on homes delivered by segment for the year ended October 31, 2021, is set forth below:

Backlog
 
At October 31, 2021 and 2020, including unconsolidated joint ventures, we had a backlog of signed contracts for 5,535 homes and 4,820 homes, respectively, representing a 14.8% increase, with sales values aggregating $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The majority of our backlog at October 31, 2021 is expected to be completed and closed within the next six to nine months. At November 30, 2021 and 2020, our backlog of signed contracts, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was 5,820 homes and 5,089 homes, respectively, with sales values aggregating $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. For information on our backlog excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, see the table on page 34 under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations -Homebuilding.”
 
Sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to 15 days after execution. This contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing. In addition, in the Northeast, and some sections of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, we typically obtain an additional 5% to 10% down payment due within 30 to 60 days after signing. In most markets, an additional deposit is required when a customer selects and commits to optional upgrades in the home. The contract may include a financing contingency, which permits customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates (including financing arranged or provided by us) is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract. This contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the contract. When housing values decline in certain markets, some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits. Cancellation rates are discussed further in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer, which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods. However, revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer, adequate initial and continuing investments have been received, and there is no continued involvement.
 
Residential Land Inventory in Planning
 
It is our objective to control a supply of land, primarily through options, whenever possible, consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets. Controlled land (land owned and under option) as of October 31, 2021, exclusive of communities under development described above under “Active Selling Communities” and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, is summarized in the following table. The proposed developable home sites in communities in planning are included in the 31,243 consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate table in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 29.

(1) | Properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation. For properties under option, as of October 31, 2021, option fees and deposits aggregated approximately $45.2 million. As of October 31, 2021, we spent an additional $13.8 million in nonrefundable predevelopment costs on such properties, including properties not under option but under evaluation.

We either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers. Under a typical agreement with the land developer, we purchase a minimal number of home sites. The balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a nonrecourse purchase agreement. During a declining homebuilding market, we typically decide to mothball (or stop development on) certain communities where we have determined that current market conditions did not justify further investment at that time. When we decide to mothball a community, the inventory is reclassified on our Consolidated Balance Sheets from Sold and unsold homes and lots under development to Land and land options held for future development or sale. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on mothballed communities. For additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Raw Materials
 
The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of or increase the cost of developing one or more of our residential communities. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources. In addition, we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes. We have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have experienced construction delays due to shortages in the supply of materials, as well as labor shortages in all of our markets. Additionally, we experienced a significant increase in lumber prices during fiscal 2021, although we have recently seen prices start to decrease. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which shortages in necessary raw materials or labor may occur in the future.
Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal in nature and, historically, weather-related problems, typically in the fall, late winter and early spring, can delay starts or closings and increase costs.
Competition
 
Our homebuilding operations are highly competitive. We are among the top 15 homebuilders in the United States in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries. We compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition. We compete primarily on the basis of reputation, price, location, design, quality, service and amenities.

Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and home building, sales and customer financing processes concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality. In addition, we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity.
 
In addition, some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved, and others may approve, slow-growth, or no-growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas. Approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets. Any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings.
 
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of storm water runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we have owned or developed or currently own or are developing (“environmental laws”). The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site’s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. See Risk Factors – “Homebuilders are subject to a number of federal, local, state, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land, the homebuilding, sales, and customer financing processes and the protection of the environment, which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas”,
