Company Overview
 Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (“Ritchie Bros.”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) (NYSE & TSX: RBA) is a world leader in asset management and disposition of used industrial equipment and other durable assets, selling $4.5 billion of used equipment and other assets during 2017. Our expertise, unprecedented global reach, market insight, and trusted portfolio of brands provide us with a unique position in the used equipment market. We primarily sell used equipment for our customers through live, unreserved auctions at 45 auction sites worldwide, which are simulcast online to reach a global bidding audience. On May 31, 2017, we acquired IronPlanet Holdings, Inc. (“IronPlanet”) for $776.5 million, a leading online marketplace for heavy equipment and other durable assets. Between its inception in 1999 and 2016, IronPlanet sold over $5 billion of used heavy equipment online and registered more than 1.5 million users worldwide. These complementary used equipment brand solutions, together with Marketplacee, our online marketplace that supports reserved pricing, provide different value propositions to equipment owners and allow us to meet the needs and preferences of a wide spectrum of equipment sellers and buyers. In the past three years, we have also added a private brokerage service (Ritchie Bros. Private Treaty) and an online listing service (Mascus).
 
Through our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of used and unused equipment, including earthmoving equipment, truck trailers, government surplus, oil and gas equipment and other industrial assets. Construction and heavy machinery comprise the majority of the equipment sold through our multiple brand solutions. Customers selling equipment through our sales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including heavy construction, transportation, agriculture, energy, and mining.
 
We operate globally with locations in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands, and employ more than 2,100 full time employees worldwide.
 
History and development of our business
 Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated was amalgamated on December 12, 1997 under, and is governed by, the Canada Business Corporation Act.
 
Ritchie Bros. was founded in 1958 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. We held our first major industrial auction in 1963, selling over $600,000 worth of construction equipment in Radium, British Columbia. By 1970, we had established operations in the United States and held our first American sale in Beaverton, Oregon. In 1987, we held our first European auctions in Liverpool, the United Kingdom, and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Our first Australian auction was held in 1990 and was followed by expansion into Asia with subsequent sales in Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore. We held our first Mexican auction in 1995 and our first auction in the Middle East in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, in 1997.
 
In March 1998, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares. Our common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the ticker symbol “RBA”.
 
In early 2013, we commercially launched our online marketplace, EquipmentOne. We continued to expand our digital capabilities through the following acquisitions over the past five years:
 

· | Xcira LLC (“Xcira”) on November 4, 2015 – a proven leader in simulcast auction technology that provides a seamless customer experience for online bidding at live on site auctions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | IronPlanet on May 31, 2017 (the “Acquisition”) – operates online and event-based equipment auctions under a number of brands discussed in more detail below
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On consummation of the Acquisition on May 31, 2017, we formed an alliance with Caterpillar Inc. (“Caterpillar”), pursuant to a Strategic Alliance and Remarketing Agreement (the “Alliance”) that we entered into on August 29, 2016. As discussed in more detail below, under the Alliance, we became Caterpillar's preferred global partner for live on site and online auctions for used Caterpillar equipment.
 
During the past five years, we also continued to grow our live on site auction business by acquiring:
 

· | The remaining interest in Ritchie Bros. Financial Services (“RBFS”) on July 12, 2016 – provides financing and leasing options to equipment purchasers, as a brokerage business, through several bank relationships (RBFS does not leverage our balance sheet for the loans it originates)

Strategy
 At the beginning of 2015, we formalized a new strategy that centered around becoming a more diversified, multi-channel company that offered a full range of asset management and disposition solutions, all on a greater scale, that would provide even more choice to customers. In 2017, we took definitive steps towards furthering this strategy by completing the transformational acquisition of IronPlanet, a leading online marketplace for heavy equipment and other durable assets. The acquisition of IronPlanet positions Ritchie Bros. as one of the world’s leading one-stop-shop asset disposition companies. We are transforming our business and the industry through our technology and data, our breadth of solutions, and our people.
 
We continue to evolve our strategy as we integrate IronPlanet and develop our multi-channel business, focusing on two overarching strategic objectives: (i) grow share of the auction segment and (ii) penetrate the upstream market. The following discussion highlights how we performed against our strategy following the executable pillars of our road map, Grow, Drive, and Optimize.
 
GROW Revenues and Earnings
 We are committed to pursuing growth initiatives that will further enhance our sector reach, drive geographic depth, meet a broader set of customer needs, and add scale to our operations. Over the last several years, we have undertaken a meaningful strategic transformation, through both organic and acquisitive growth initiatives, to broaden our service offering and the value propositions that we provide to different segments of the used asset and equipment market. Notably, the Acquisition with IronPlanet positions us to accelerate this strategy and take positive and meaningful steps towards meeting our strategic objectives.
 
We are focused on the following initiatives to deliver growth:
 

· | Leveraging and scaling our one-stop-shop multi-channel solution set to drive organic market share and incremental penetration with existing customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scaling multi-channel capabilities, including our IronPlanet Weekly Featured Auction and Marketplacee, to grow within existing sectors as well as penetrating new sector opportunities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging and expanding multi-channel capabilities internationally; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ritchie Bros. | 4
--------------+--


· | Driving increased penetration of auction services and, specifically, RBFS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------



DRIVE Efficiencies and Effectiveness
 We plan to take advantage of opportunities to improve overall effectiveness of our organization. We are committed to driving efficiencies and effectiveness by:
 

· | Improving sales effectiveness and sales productivity through consistent go-to-market processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leveraging the rich data sets that we have at our disposal to create a unique and differentiated customer experience and delivering trust and confidence across our consignor and buyer bases;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Modernizing legacy systems and working to unify auction platforms to deliver technology efficiencies and create network effects for buyers and sellers by comprehensively meeting their needs, ease of use, and our business model;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Scaling the business and leveraging our expanded set of multi-channel assets to optimize our overall asset utilization and site optimization efforts while delivering choice to our customers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Achieving acquisition synergies; and
--+-------------------------------------


· | Targeting operating expense growth lower than revenue growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
OPTIMIZE our Balance Sheet
 Our business model provides us with the ability to generate strong cash flows. Cash flow represents our ability to convert revenue to cash, and provides a meaningful indication of the strength of our business. We will focus not only on profit growth but also further enhancing cash flow, reviewing contract structures and auction site returns to improve the cash flow and asset returns of our Auctions and Marketplaces (“A&M”) segment. During 2016, we also adjusted our capital structure, taking on more debt (through a new syndicated credit facility and issuance of senior unsecured notes) to acquire IronPlanet. We also continued to be prudent with our organic capital expenditures.
 
The acquisition of IronPlanet is a transformational transaction that will increase both the scale and the scope of our Company. The enhanced scale of our combined business is expected to drive further operating leverage from our unique business model, and provide new opportunities to operate more efficiently by utilizing an increasingly digital service offering.
 
We are focused on these areas to deliver optimization of our balance sheet:
 

· | Increasing cash flows from operating activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Targeting net capital spend at less than 10% of revenue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | Investing in information technology systems to optimize business processes and reduce costs; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Managing debt levels while returning cash via ongoing dividends.

Intellectual Property
 We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in marketing our organization, services, and website, as well as differentiating us from our competitors. We own or hold the rights to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks, domain names and tradenames. We protect our intellectual property in Canada, the United States, and internationally through federal, provincial, state, and common law rights, including registration of certain trade mark and service marks for many of our brands, including our core brands. We also have secured patents for inventions and have registered our domain names.
 
We rely on contractual restrictions and rights to protect certain of our proprietary rights in products and services. Effective protection of our intellectual property can be expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in many jurisdictions throughout the world. In addition, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property claims, including allegations of infringement, which can be costly to defend. For a discussion of the risks involved with intellectual property litigation and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, see the related information in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition 
 
Competition Overview
 The global used industrial equipment market is highly fragmented and often fluid between sales channels. We compete for purchasers and sellers of used equipment with other asset management and disposition companies. These companies include non-auction competitors such as equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers, used equipment brokers, equipment rental companies, and other online marketplaces. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology, and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had previously tried selling their equipment privately.
 
Competitive advantages
 Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages, and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term. Our Gross Transaction Value1 (“GTV”) has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 9.30% over the last 25 years, as illustrated below.
 

Global platform
 Our business is a leader of equipment disposition services, with global reach, including 45 auction sites in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands. Our online bidding technology and Ritchie Bros. website are available in nine and 22 languages, respectively. Our global presence ensures we generate global market pricing for our equipment sellers, as we reach international buyers and equipment demand, helping to deliver strong price realization through our sales channels. This global reach provides us and our selling customers with the ability to transcend local market conditions.

Breadth of solutions 
 We have the unique ability to meet all the buyers’ and sellers’ specific needs in a one-stop shop manner. The event-driven auction, which has been our core business for over 50 years, is just one solution—albeit a powerful solution—to meet customers’ varied needs. By delivering choice, we can work with customers as a trusted advisor to provide them with a tailored suite of equipment disposition solutions and, in the medium and long term, asset management. This is truly a fundamental evolution and transformation in the industry.
 
While we have a full suite of solutions, most of our auction volumes are generated through three core solutions. First, the unreserved live on site integrated auctions that provide our customers care, custody, and control. This offering is Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, our primary business. Second, weekly online auctions for sellers looking to manage the disposition of their assets on a more frequent basis and being able to sell from their yard or location without having to move equipment. This offering is the IronPlanet Weekly Featured Auction. Third, our reserve online marketplace that affords sellers with control over price and timing, and with solutions such as Make Offer, Buy Now, and Reserve Price selling formats for buyers. We have recently launched a combined reserved online marketplace bringing together EquipmentOne and IronPlanet’s Daily Marketplace. The combined offering is known as Marketplacee.
 
An industry leader in a highly fragmented market
 Based on a review of the construction, transportation and agricultural used equipment markets that we conducted in 2016, we believe the global used equipment market is valued at more than $300 billion2, including an opportunity in the United States of over $50 billion. The market is highly fragmented and fluid between sales channels; however, we believe our multi-channel brand solutions can meet a broad range of customer preferences and needs. While our business is a global market leader for the sale of used equipment, we currently have only 1.4% of the estimated global used equipment market, based on GTV during 2017. The United States represents a key area for growth with positive industrial tailwinds around infrastructure and construction.
 
Multi-channel product offering
 Our multi-channel brand solutions provide a wide range of options for used industrial equipment, which appeal to a variety of personal preferences for sellers and buyers. We continue to build on our strong brand equity and loyal customer base by providing many value-added services to equipment sellers and buyers, including financing and leasing solutions, appraisal services, insurance services, refurbishment, and logistics services. We continue to look for even more ways to support the equipment industry and serve the various needs of equipment owners.
 
Diverse sector coverage
 Our sales solutions cater to the needs of end users, dealers, and other equipment sellers across a variety of sectors, such as construction, transportation, agriculture, energy, and mining. This diversity of sectors mitigates sector-specific exposure and enables the sale of equipment with cross-sector applications, regardless of sector-specific cyclicality.
 
Experienced management team
 Our experienced management team continues to capitalize on the strength of our live on site auction offering, while expanding our online offering through multiple acquisitions to better serve our existing customers and to attract new customers. Our executives have served as officers of a number of well-known global public companies, and we have developed a deep understanding of the used equipment market and customer base.

Data and sector intelligence
 We transacted hundreds of thousands of assets through our sales channels in 2017 and had more than 694,000 people register to bid as users of www.rbauction.com or www.ironplanet.com in 2017. The volume of transactions and customer interactions have provided us with a unique, proprietary database of information. This database provides us with some of the world’s best information to identify market trends and estimate used equipment values.
 
The Role of Technology 
 The role of technology in our business continues to evolve and become more meaningful as more buyers adopt mobile and online channels to transact their business with us. We have been on a pathway to leverage digital and technology capabilities to improve the consumer auction and leverage technology as a competitive differentiator.
 
The acquisition of IronPlanet was an inflection point in our business and was a step change in this direction as it positioned us as a technology-enabled asset disposition company. The combination of IronPlanet’s technology and our existing assets results in tools and capabilities that provide our customers, both buyers and sellers, with more efficient and richer experiences for creation of deeper brand loyalty.
 
Buyers will now find it easier to locate inventory across all our websites with our enhanced search capabilities while sellers leverage both our rich data repository as well as our platform solution tools to give them the insights, tools, and solutions to manage their assets in an informed, efficient manner.
 
Offerings and initiatives
 
Integrated search capabilities 
 We are focused on helping buyers find what they are looking for easily and quickly while providing access to the largest equipment inventory across our brands and solutions. Our focus on improving our search capabilities allows us to extend our reach to more customers in a channel agnostic manner.
 
Marketplacee
 Bringing together EquipmentOne and IronPlanet’s Daily Marketplace, we introduced a new sales solution, Marketplacee, in late 2017. Marketplacee is a flexible, online marketplace that gives customers the choice of negotiating offers, selling their assets at fixed prices, or setting a reserve (minimum) price. These three selling options are designed to give sellers more control over the selling price and processing of their assets while still benefiting from our marketing and expansive, global buyer network. Marketplacee provides choice to buyers who may prefer to buy in different formats based on their individual needs.
 
Platform solutions
 Our unique software solutions allow us to work with sellers as a true business advisor as we provide tools, data, and insights to help our customers make real-time asset disposition decisions and deepen our relationships with our customers.
 
Auction management systems
 We are in the preliminary stages of this initiative of leveraging one holistic platform to drive the live on site auction and online marketplace experience. Today, we have two discrete platforms. Known as project “MARS”, the new platform is a transformative initiative allowing us to simplify our technology footprint, reduce complexity, spur future innovation, and enable the development of customer-facing growth drivers such as more sophisticated personalization, data-driven insights, and real-time data-driven marketing.
 
RBA mobile app
 Providing customers with the ability to search, register, and bid at our live on site auctions around the world using mobile devices. Mobile capabilities provide another opportunity to make our customer experiences easy and flexible so they can conduct business with us seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

Segmented Information
 Segmented information is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in footnote 4 to “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Segmented information from prior years has been restated in footnote 4 to reflect the identification of the A&M reporting segment as of September 30, 2017.
Geographical Information
 Geographical information about our revenues is disclosed in “Part II, Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Geographic Analysis”, which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference. Our international operations are subject to certain risks, as disclosed in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
The distribution of our long-lived assets includes property, plant and equipment according to the country in which they are located, is as follows:
 

 | | | | Outside of | | United | | | | 
-------------------------------+--------+----+---+------------+----+--------+--------+---+-------+---
 | Canada | | | Canada | | States | Europe | | Other | 
Long-lived assets distribution | | | | | | | | | | | | |

December 31, 2015 | | 20 | % | | 80 | % | 55 | % | | 15 | % | 10 | %

Seasonality
 Our GTV and associated A&M segment revenues are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. GTV and A&M segment revenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than in the first and third calendar quarters. Given the operating leverage inherent in our business model, the second and fourth quarter also tend to produce higher operating margins, given the higher volume and revenue generated in those quarters.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws
 Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules, and regulations throughout the world. We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with those laws, rules, and regulations that affect our business, and that such compliance does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct our business.
 
We believe that, among other things, laws, rules, and regulations related to the following list of items affect our business:
 

· | Imports and exports of equipment. Particularly, there are restrictions in the United States and Europe that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions. Also, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those regions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development or expansion of auction sites. Such activities depend upon the receipt of required licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. We are also subject to various local zoning requirements pertaining to the location of our auction sites, which vary among jurisdictions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of, or other person involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee or other person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
