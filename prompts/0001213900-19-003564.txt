Item 1. Description of Business.
General
 
Bison Capital Acquisition Corp. is a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 7, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had not yet commenced any operations or generated any revenues. All activity from inception to December 31, 2018, relates to our formation, the consummation of our IPO of 6,037,500 units, and the simultaneous sale of 432,062 private units in a private placement described below, and the identification and evaluation of prospective candidates for a business combination.
 
The registration statements for our IPO were declared effective on June 19, 2017. On June 23, 2017, we consummated the IPO of 5,250,000 units (“Units” and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $52,500,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the sale of 388,750 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Unit in a private placement to Bison Capital Holding Company Limited (“Bison Capital”) and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EarlyBirdCapital”) and their designees, generating gross proceeds of $3,887,500.
 
Following the closing of the IPO and the private placement on June 23, 2017, an amount of $53,812,500 ($10.25 per IPO Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the Private Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.
 
On June 28, 2017, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, we consummated the sale of an additional 787,500 units at $10.00 per Unit, and the sale of an additional 43,312 Private Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating total gross proceeds of $8,308,125. A total of $8,071,875 of the net proceeds were deposited in the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to $61,884,375.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $2,250,189 consisting of $1,811,250 of underwriting fees and $438,939 of other costs.
 
As of December 31, 2018, $122,615 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes. Interest earned on the Trust Account balance through December 31, 2018 available to be released to us for the payment of tax obligations amounted to $1,426,509. As of December 31, 2018, the Sponsor has loaned us an aggregate of $600,000. Our Sponsor has also committed to provide an additional $200,000 in loans to the Company. The Company has drawn down the entire $600,000 as of the date of this Form 10-K. The loans will become due upon the consummation of a business combination and carry no interest. $500,000 of the loans are evidenced by two promissory notes issued by us, which are convertible, in whole or in part, at the Sponsor’s discretion, upon the consummation of the Business Combination, into the private units, at a price of $10.00 per private unit.
 
On September 12, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Xynomic, Merger Sub, and Yinglin Mark Xu, solely in his capacity as the Stockholder Representative thereunder. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into Xynomic, with Xynomic continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger will become effective at such time on the Closing Date as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other time specified in the certificate of merger (the “Effective Time”). The transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement are referred as “Business Combination” in the Merger Prospectus. The closing of the Merger Agreement shall be upon the consummation of the Business Combination (the “Closing”).
 
1

 

Prior to the Closing, we will continue out of the British Virgin Islands and domesticate as a Delaware corporation and will no longer be considered a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.
 
At the Effective Time, each share of Xynomic common stock and preferred stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time (excluding dissenting shares as defined in the Merger Agreement, if any) will be automatically converted into the right to receive, on a pro rata basis, the Closing Consideration Shares (as defined below) and the Earnout Shares (as defined below), and each option to purchase Xynomic stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by the Company and automatically converted into an option to purchase shares of common stock of the Company.
 
Prior to the Domestication, we are a foreign private issuer. Upon the Domestication, we will lose our foreign private issuer status and are seeking shareholder approval of the Business Combination at the Meeting at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the Business Combination. The shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account ($10.25 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). Among other closing conditions included in the Merger Agreement, we will proceed with the Business Combination only if we will have net tangible assets of at least $7,500,000 after giving effect to the Business Combination and the Business Combination is approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy of the Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 20% or more of the ordinary shares sold in the IPO without our prior written consent.
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors, and EarlyBirdCapital (including their designees, the “Initial Shareholders”) have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares, private shares, and any shares acquired in or after the IPO in favor of the Business Combination, (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, prior to and unrelated to the Business Combination, an amendment to our Current Charter that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem all Public Shares if we cannot complete the Business Combination by March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison’s board of directors upon receipt of Bison’s shareholders’ approval of the Extension Proposal), unless we provide public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a business combination; and (d) that the Founder Shares and private units or the securities underlying the private units shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if the Business Combination is not consummated.
 
If we are unable to complete the Business Combination before March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison’s board of directors upon receipt of Bison’s shareholders’ approval of the Extension Proposal), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than five (5) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares (including any public units in the IPO or any public units or shares that the Initial Shareholders or their affiliates purchased in the IPO or later acquired in the open market or in private transactions) which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of Bison, subject (in each case of (ii) and (iii) above) to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In connection with the redemption of 100% of our outstanding Public Shares, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (net of any taxes payable).

The Initial Shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and the shares underlying the private units (i) in connection with the Closing and (ii) if we fail to complete the Closing before March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison’s board of directors upon receipt of Bison’s shareholders’ approval of the Extension Proposal). The Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any acquired Public Shares in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. However, if our Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the IPO, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such Public Shares if we fail to complete the Closing before March 23, 2019 (which will be extended to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison’s board of directors upon receipt of Bison’s shareholders’ approval of the Extension Proposal). In the event of such redemption, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for redemption (including Trust Account assets) will be less than the $10.25 per unit.


The Sponsor has agreed that it will indemnify us to the extent necessary to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced by the claims of prospective target businesses with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company, but only if such a vendor or prospective target business does not execute such a waiver. The Sponsor, however, may not be able to meet such obligation as we have not required the Sponsor to retain any assets to provide for its indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, the Sponsor will not be liable to our public shareholders if the Sponsor should fail to satisfy its obligations under this agreement and instead will only be liable to us. We will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses, or other entities with which we have business execute agreements waiving any right, title, interest, or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Therefore, the distribution from the Trust Account to each holder of ordinary shares may be less than $10.25 per unit.
 
Recent Developments
 
During Bison’s search for a suitable target for a business combination, Bison had looked at several healthcare service businesses in China including Target 1 and Target 3. Bison learned about Xynomic in August 2017 when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Xynomic, Yinglin Mark Xu, discussed Xynomic’s business plan with us. In late August 2017, we selected Xynomic as a potential target for a SPAC transaction based on: (i) Xynomic’s valuable Phase 3 oncology biotech assets in-licensed from major international pharmaceutical companies, (ii) strong market demand with multiple clinical indications, comprehensive clinical data, and decades of academic research, (iii) a highly experienced management team and scientific advisory board consisting of industry veterans and key opinion leaders (“KOLs”) in oncology drug research and development in the U.S., Europe, and China, (iv) several clinical milestones in 2018 that indicate meaningful value growth of Xynomic, and (v) the willingness to seek public listing in the near term to further expand the business internationally.
 
In October 2017, Bison visited KOLs in oncology during a due diligence trip at the University of California, San Francisco to discuss the clinical data regarding Xynomic’s lead compound and its pipeline. We also revisited Xynomic and KOLs and the internal pharmaceutical companies who had collaborated with Xynomic on the clinical trials in January 2018. By February 2018, Xynomic had become the main target of Bison.
 
On November 28, 2017, Bison executed a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with Xynomic.
 
On February 19, 2018, Bison management provided a telephonic update to its board of directors on the progress of searching for a potential business combination target, including the potential Xynomic business combination opportunity.
 
On February 27, 2018, Bison management, on behalf of the board of directors, reached out to Cassel Salpeter & Co., LLC (“Cassel Salpeter”) to discuss retaining Cassel Salpeter to provide an opinion to the board of directors or the Special Committee to be formed, as applicable, regarding the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration to be issued by the Company in the proposed business combination and whether Xynomic had a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of funds in the Company’s Trust Account (net of taxes payable, if any, on the interest income from the Trust Account). In March 2018, Bison commenced financial and legal due diligence on Xynomic. We interviewed members of management of Xynomic with respect to the financial and legal aspects of Xynomic. Information had been provided in batches during the due diligence review process, which included previous financial statements, licensing agreements, and contracts with large pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (“CROs”). We have engaged Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC (“HTFL”) as our legal counsel prior to the listing of Bison and HTFL continued to serve as Bison’s legal advisor for the Business Combination. The legal due diligence report was presented to the Bison management on August 18, 2018.

Beginning in March 2018, Bison and its advisors continued to conduct business, financial, legal, and accounting due diligence in coordination with Xynomic and its advisors. At the same time, representatives and advisors of Xynomic and Bison began to negotiate preliminary terms of the definitive transaction agreements.
 
Following discussion of Xynomic as a potential target for a business combination among the board of directors on May 7, 2018, Bison entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Xynomic (the “Xynomic LOI”). Pursuant to the Xynomic LOI, Bison would acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Xynomic, in exchange for certain securities of Bison to be issued to the equity holders of Xynomic with a then market value equaling the total equity value of Xynomic, as set forth in a valuation report prepared by a reputable, independent valuation expert, subject to certain adjustments based on the balance sheets of Xynomic at the closing. In addition, Xynomic had agreed to complete at least 3 out of 4 scientific milestones by June 30, 2018 under the Xynomic LOI, which include (a) first-patient-in in FL (accelerated pivotal Phase 2); (b) first-patient-in in RCC (priority review pivotal Phase 3, co-partnering with); (c) first-patient-in in Imbruvica/abexinostat against DLBCL and MCL (Phase ½, co-partnering); and (d) first-patient-in in Keytruda®/abexinostat against multiple solid tumors (Phase 1b, co-partnering). Bison agreed, to the extent necessary to close the potential business combination, to conduct a private placement offering in connection with the business combination. The parties also agreed to grant certain registration rights to the Bison shares to be issued to the holders of Xynomic and subject those shares to a lock-up period of nine months after the completion of the potential business combination. According to the Xynomic LOI, during a period from the execution of the Xynomic LOI until the termination as provided thereunder (the “Exclusivity Period”), Xynomic would not directly or indirectly silicate, initiate or engage into discussion, negotiations or transactions with, or encourage or provide any information concerning any transaction with respect to the direct or indirect sale, transfer, license or other disposition of Xynomic, its equity interests or its business or material assets, whether by merger, purchase, consolidation, recapitalization, exclusive license or any similar transaction that would reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially impair the proposed business combination with Bison as contemplated in the Xynomic LOI (a “Competing Transaction”), or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent or definitive agreement with respect thereto. Bison, on the other hand, was not subject to similar exclusivity under the Xynomic LOI.
 
In arriving at the type and amount of consideration outlined in the letter of intent, the Bison management team considered, among other factors: (i) higher deal certainty and less execution risks associated with an all-stock merger with no minimum cash requirement (on the amount of funds remaining in trust following redemptions) relative to an all-cash or cash/stock deal (similar to merger) with a minimum cash condition, (ii) Xynomic’s goal of becoming a publicly traded company, (iii) the stated intentions of major Xynomic stockholders, including Yinglin Mark Xu, to utilize the public company platform to raise Xynomic’s visibility and to facilitate accretive acquisitions after the business combination, and (iv) the attractive value of Xynomic supported by a weighted average of the value of comparable biotechnology companies.


Following the entry into the Xynomic LOI, Bison management decided to engage a financial advisor in order to help management assess Xynomic, particularly taking into the account that Xynomic is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company. We reached out to Venture Valuation (“Venture”) to consult on matters regarding the valuation of Xynomic. Venture has established experience and expertise in connection with the valuation and assessment of biotech companies with representative offices in Europe, North America and Asia. On May 19, 2018, Bison’s management had a call with Venture along with our legal counsel HTFL and formally decided to engage Venture as financial advisor to Bison to work closely with and under the instructions of Bison management to interview Xynomic management and scientific team, conduct market research and investigate the business and operation of Xynomic to render a sensitivity analysis of different assumptions and a value range of pre-money equity of Xynomic. Venture’s engagement was not relevant to the valuation report required in Xynomic LOI to set forth a fair value of Xynomic as Bison management’s communications with Venture or materials provided by Venture had not been shared with Xynomic before the entry of the Merger Agreement. Venture did not analyze the preliminary and final merger consideration that Bison management offered to Xynomic nor the fairness thereof.

On May 25, 2018, Bison management provided a telephonic update to its board of directors on the status of the potential business combination with Xynomic, including the executed letter of intent and the due diligence efforts of Bison management. The board of directors formed a special committee consisting of only independent directors of Bison, Messrs. Richard Wu, Thomas Folinsbee, and Charles Prizzi, in order to review the potential business combination (the “Special Committee”). The Special Committee considered the qualifications of Cassel Salpeter and directed management to negotiate an engagement letter on behalf of the Special Committee to retain Cassel Salpeter to render a fairness opinion to the Special Committee in connection with the potential business combination.
 
On May 28, 2018, Cassel Salpeter was formally engaged by Bison on behalf of the Special Committee to render a fairness opinion to the Special Committee in connection with the potential business combination. Bison and Xynomic agreed that a fairness opinion by Cassel Salpeter would satisfy the valuation report requirement set forth in Xynomic LOI.
 
On May 29, 2018, representatives of Bison met with Xynomic’s management and were joined by Bison’s financial advisor, Venture, via telephone, to discuss Xynomic’s 2018 year-to-date performance and 2018 and 2019 full-year forecasts.
 
On May 29, 2018, Venture reached out to Xynomic’s management to discuss the basic ideas of Xynomic’s products and the status of Xynomic’s licensing agreements as of that date. The discussion mainly focused on the forecast for the product XP-101, i.e., abexinostat, and future development of the product. During the next two weeks, Venture had a meeting with Xynomic’s Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Jason Wu, in London to discuss the technical aspects and current development status of the product.
 
On May 31, 2018, Bison management including Venture discussed the Venture’s investigation on Xynomic and its initial sensitivity value range of a pre-market equity of Xynomic XP 101 and 102 assets and a pre-market equity of potential XP 105 for the treatment of breast cancer. Taking into consideration of the sensitivity value range suggested by Venture and many other factors including the terms set forth in Xynomic LOI, subject to the satisfaction of the scientific milestones set forth in the Xynomic LOI, Bison preliminarily agreed to a valuation of $450 million subject to certain adjustments.
 
On June 4, 2018, representatives of Bison and the Special Committee, including HTFL, Marcum LLP (“Marcum”) as Bison’s auditor, Venture, Cassel Salpeter, and Xynomic and Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley”), participated in an organization call to discuss various work streams, including the preparation of the definitive transaction agreements, Bison’s preliminary proxy statement/prospectus, and the transaction process and the anticipated timeline with respect to the potential business combination.
 
On June 10, 2018, Bison’s legal counsel, HTFL, sent an initial draft of the Merger Agreement to Xynomic’s legal counsel, Sidley, based on the terms of the executed letter of intent, as well as an initial draft of the Bison preliminary proxy statement/prospectus to Bison, Xynomic, and their respective representatives.
 
On June 26, 2018, Cassel Salpeter discussed with the Special Committee its preliminary financial analyses with respect to Xynomic and the proposed business combination.
 
On July 13, 2018, Sidley sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to HTFL, which reflected certain key terms of the agreement, including terms regarding the tax treatment of the Merger, changes to certain representations and warranties and covenants, and additional provisions.
 
On July 25, 2018, HTFL sent a revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley regarding the matters contained in July 13 draft and the indemnifications, procedures to adjust closing calculation to the merger consideration, and other provisions.

On July 27, 2018, Bison management presented an internal valuation report for Xynomic to the Special Committee of the board of directors for their review and comment and proposed a merger consideration ranging between $350-450 million to be agreed by the parties.
 
On July 31, 2018, the Special Committee met telephonically to hear from Venture regarding its progress in connection with the valuation of Xynomic. Bison’s management discussed the potential business combination with Xynomic, including a process and due diligence update and a discussion of Xynomic’s 2018 year-to-date performance and full-year forecast.
 
On August 2, 2018, Bison management provided a telephonic update to its board of directors, primarily to discuss valuation of Xynomic with respect to the anticipated full-year Xynomic financial performance and future outlook of its business.
 
On August 8, 2018, Sidley sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to HTFL, which reflected certain key terms of the agreement, including changes to certain representations and warranties and operating covenants.
 
On August 16, 2018, HTFL sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley.
 
In the first two weeks of August 2018, Bison management actively discussed the valuation of Xynomic with Venture internally and negotiated with Xynomic externally. Upon the completion of the review of Xynomic and its business updates especially regarding the scientific milestones set forth in the Xynomic LOI, Bison offered Xynomic a merger consideration of $350 million, payable in Bison’s shares at $10.15 per share, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Bison later received a counter-offer from Xynomic that such offer would be accepted provided that Bison was willing to pay an additional earnout consideration based on a worldwide exclusive license to a Phase 2 ready oncology drug candidate that Xynomic commenced negotiating with the potential licensor. Bison reviewed the related information provided by Xynomic regarding the proposed earnout consideration and assessed the value of such license based on the proposed terms of the license agreement. The valuation was subsequently updated to include earnout projections and closing projections.
 
On August 20, 2018, Bison and Xynomic and their representatives and advisors held a status update call and agreed to the closing consideration of $350 million (subject to certain adjustments) and an earnout consideration of $100 million (subject to the terms and conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement).
 
On August 24, 2018, Sidley sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to HTFL reflecting, among others, the agreed merger consideration and arrangement of issuance of earnout shares and its tax impact.
 
On August 25, 2018, HTFL sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley.
 
On August 29, 2018, Sidley sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to HTFL.
 
On August 31, 2018, HTFL sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to Sidley.
 
On September 6, 2018, Sidley sent a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement to HTFL.
 
On September 8, 2018, a meeting of the Special Committee and a meeting of the board of directors were called to discuss and approve the Merger Agreement to be held on September 11, 2018, respectively. HTFL submitted a draft of the Merger Agreement substantially the same in the final form of the Merger Agreement to the Special Committee and the board of directors.
 
On June 10, 2018, HTFL circulated an initial draft of the Bison preliminary proxy statement/prospectus to Bison, Xynomic, and their respective representatives.

On September 11, 2018, Bison’s Special Committee met telephonically to discuss the status of the proposed business combination with Xynomic, including the status of the Merger Agreement. Also in attendance were certain officers of Bison and representatives of HTFL, Venture, and Cassel Salpeter. At the request of the Special Committee, Cassel Salpeter discussed its financial analyses with respect to the Xynomic and the proposed business combination. At the request of the Special Committee, Cassel Salpeter rendered its oral opinion to the Special Committee (which was confirmed in writing by delivery of Cassel Salpeter’s written opinion dated such date), to the effect that, as of September 11, 2018, and based on and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications, and other matters considered in the preparation of such opinion, (i) the Aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued by the Company in the merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company and (ii) Xynomic had a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of funds in the Company’s Trust Account. Representatives from HTFL then discussed proposed resolutions regarding the approval of the definitive Merger Agreement and on behalf of management, discussed the due diligence. The board of directors then scheduled a call for the afternoon to discuss the status of the Business Combination and any updates to the materials discussed, and to approve the merger with Xynomic. After taking various factors in connection with the Merger Agreement and related transactions and discussions with the assistance of its and the Special Committee’s legal and financial advisors, the Special Committee recommended the board of directors to approve the Merger Agreement and its related transactions.
 
Later on September 11, 2018, Bison’s board of directors met again telephonically to further consider the merger with Xynomic including the definitive Merger Agreement and the recommendation of the Special Committee to approve the Merger Agreement and related transactions. Also in attendance were certain officers of Bison and representatives of HTFL. After considering the proposed terms of the Merger Agreement and other related transaction agreements and taking into account the other factors described below under the caption “Bison’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Approval of the Business Combination,” Bison’s board of directors unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and related agreements and determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of Bison to consummate the Business Combination and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and related agreements, directed that the Merger Agreement and the other proposals described in the Merger Prospectus be submitted to Bison’s shareholders for approval and adoption, and recommended that Bison’s shareholders approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and such other proposals.


Later on September 12, 2018, Bison and Xynomic entered into the Merger Agreement.
 
Also on September 12, 2018, a press release was issued announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination
 
On September 13, 2018, Bison filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K attaching the press release.
 
During the morning of September 19, 2018, Bison and Xynomic held a joint investor call to discuss the Business Combination and Xynomic’s business.
 
On September 28, 2018, Sidley circulated a revised draft of the Bison preliminary proxy statement/prospectus to HTFL reflecting the terms of the executed merger agreement and providing other updates.
 
In the first week of December 2018, Xynomic informed Bison that they were finalizing the license agreement with the other party about the worldwide exclusive license to a Phase 2 ready oncology drug and likely to achieve the Earnout Criteria by end of December 2018. From then, Xynomic actively updated Bison and their representative about the status of such license agreement.
 
On December 20, 2018, Xynomic announced publicly that it had been granted an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize BI 860585, a phase 2 ready mTORC1/2 inhibitor, from Boehringer Ingelheim.
 
On December 22, 2018, Bison obtained a copy of the signed license agreement dated December 20, 2018 between Boehringer Ingelheim and Xynomic. Upon receipt, Bison reviewed the terms and conditions of the license agreement against the agreed earnout criteria set forth in the Merger Agreement. After discussion with its representatives and Cassel Salpeter, Bison concluded that the value of such license and the relevant drug candidate are materially consistent with or at least no less than the value they projected when entering into the Merger Agreement. On December 28, 2018, Bison submitted a copy of the license agreement with its analysis and decision to the Special Committee and the board of directors. On the same day, HTFL was instructed to notify Sidley that Bison agreed with Xynomic’s position that the Earnout Criteria had been achieved.

On February 11, 2019, the parties amended the Merger Agreement to adopt an amendment to the Proposed Amended and Restated Charter, namely Certificate of Incorporation of Xynomic Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., the combined entity following the Merger, to clarify that its exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder.
 
On February 22, 2019, the parties amended the Merger Agreement to extend the Outside Date from March 23, 2019 to June 24, 2019 or such earlier date as determined by Bison’s Board (the “Extended Termination Date”). On the same day, Bison filed a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule 14A to seek shareholders’ approval to amend its current charter to extend the Outside Date from March 23, 2019 to the Extended Termination Date, and provide that the date for cessation of operations of the Company if the Company has not completed a business combination would similarly be extended by amending the Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Extension Amendment”); and to amend the Company’s investment management trust agreement, dated June 19, 2017 (the “Trust Agreement”) by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”) to extend the date on which to commence liquidating the Trust Account established in connection with the Company’s initial public offering in the event the Company has not consummated a business combination from the Current Termination Date to the Extended Termination Date by amending the Trust Agreement (the “Trust Amendment”).
 
On March 3, 2019, Bison received a commitment from Xynomic that it has agreed to contribute to Bison as a loan $0.02 per month for each public share that is not redeemed by Bison’s shareholders (the “Contribution”) in connection with the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment. If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved by the Company’s shareholders and the Company takes until June 24, 2019 to complete its initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or Bison’s subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.55 per share, in comparison to the redemption amount of $10.49 per share as of December 31, 2018 (assuming no public shares were redeemed in connection with the extension). 


Effecting a Business Combination
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. Our board of directors determined that this test was met in connection with the proposed business combination with Xynomic
Business Combination Procedures
 
In connection with the proposed business combination with Xynomic, we will seek shareholder approval of such initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as described below, our initial shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account in connection with a proposed business combination. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our initial shareholders, our officers and directors, and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of the proposed business combination with Xynomic and (2) not to convert any ordinary shares owned by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination with Xynomic.
 
Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares in connection with Extension Amendment and Trust Amendment
 
If the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment are approved (and not abandoned), Bison will afford the public shareholders making the election to redeem their public shares, the opportunity to receive, at the time the Extension Amendment and the Trust Amendment become effective, and in exchange for the surrender of their shares, a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account. Public shareholders will also be able to redeem their public shares in connection with the expected shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination with Xynomic, or if the Bison has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Termination Date.


Competition
 
If we succeed in effecting a business combination with Xynomic, there will be, in all likelihood, significant competition from its competitors. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. Information regarding Xynomic’s competition will be set forth in the proxy statement for the meeting to be called to approve the business combination and in other future filings.
 
Prior to the completion of a business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors

Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we have no employees except our four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Business Combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our Business Combination and we currently do not have any full-time employees.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 609-610 2st Century Tower, No. 40 Liangmaqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100016, China. The cost for this space is included in the $5,000 per month fee that we pay an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative services. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the metropolitan area that this amount is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, ordinary shares, rights and warrants are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements must be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or IFRS as issued by the IASB and the historical financial statements must be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and consummate our initial business combination.
 
We are required to evaluate and report on our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although if our total annual gross revenues exceeds $1.07 billion, or our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion, or if the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, we would cease to be an “emerging growth company” as of the following fiscal year.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this Report.
