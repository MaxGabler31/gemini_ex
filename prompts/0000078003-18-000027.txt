ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

 ABOUT PFIZER 
Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines and vaccines, as well as many of the world’s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942. 
We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our company’s purpose of innovating to bring therapies to patients that extend and significantly improve their lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our shareholders. 
We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities.
Our significant recent business development activities include:

• | On February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of our global infusion systems net assets, HIS, to ICU Medical for up to approximately $900 million, composed of cash and contingent cash consideration, ICU Medical common stock and seller financing. HIS, which was acquired as part of the Hospira acquisition in September 2015, includes IV pumps, solutions and devices.


• | On December 22, 2016, for $1,045 million we acquired the development and commercialization rights to AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business, primarily outside the U.S., which includes the newly approved EU drug Zavicefta™ (ceftazidime-avibactam), the marketed agents Merrem™/Meronem™ (meropenem) and Zinforo™ (ceftaroline fosamil), and the clinical development assets aztreonam-avibactam and ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam.


• | On September 28, 2016, we acquired Medivation for approximately $14.3 billion in cash ($13.9 billion, net of cash acquired). Medivation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology.


• | On June 24, 2016, we acquired Anacor for approximately $4.9 billion in cash ($4.5 billion net of cash acquired), plus $698 million debt assumed. Anacor is a biopharmaceutical company focused on novel small-molecule therapeutics derived from its boron chemistry platform.


• | On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately $16.1 billion in cash ($15.7 billion, net of cash acquired).

For a further discussion of our strategy and our business development initiatives, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Acquisitions, Sale of Hospira Infusion Systems Net Assets, Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Strategy—Our Business Development Initiatives section in our 2017 Financial Report.
Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and product labeling. Similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA regulates the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of drugs for the EU and the European Economic Area countries. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see the Government Regulation and Price Constraints section below.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS
We manage our commercial operations through two distinct business segments: Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH). The IH and EH operating segments are each led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof-of-concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. 
Some additional information about our business segments as of the date of the filing of this 2017 Form 10-K follows:

IH focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines and vaccines that significantly improve patients’ lives, as well as products for consumer healthcare.Key therapeutic areas include internal medicine, vaccines, oncology, inflammation & immunology, rare disease and consumer healthcare. | EH includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable products, biosimilars, select branded products including anti-infectives and, through February 2, 2017, HIS. EH also includes an R&D organization, as well as our contract manufacturing business. 
We expect that the IH biopharmaceutical portfolio of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to help ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. The assets managed by IH are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high-level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. | EH is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. EH leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, EH leverages capabilities in formulation development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. EH may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies. 
IH will have continued focus on R&D productivity and pipeline strength while maximizing the value of our recently launched brands and in-line portfolio. Our acquisitions of Anacor and Medivation expanded our pipeline in the high priority therapeutic areas of inflammation and immunology and oncology. | For EH, we continue to invest in growth drivers and manage the portfolio to extract additional value while seeking opportunities for operating efficiencies. This strategy includes active management of our portfolio; maximizing growth of core product segments; acquisitions to strengthen core areas of our portfolio further, such as our recent acquisition of AstraZeneca’s small molecule anti-infectives business; and divestitures to increase focus on our core strengths. In line with this strategy, on February 3, 2017, we completed the sale of Pfizer’s global infusion systems net assets, representing the infusion systems net assets that we acquired as part of the Hospira transaction, HIS, to ICU Medical.
Leading brands include:- Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13- Xeljanz- Eliquis- Lyrica (U.S., Japan and certain other markets)- Enbrel (outside the U.S. and Canada)- Ibrance- Xtandi- Several OTC consumer healthcare products (e.g., Advil and Centrum) | Leading brands include:- Lipitor- Premarin family- Norvasc- Lyrica (Europe, Russia, Turkey, Israel and Central Asia countries)- Celebrex- Viagra*- Inflectra/Remsima- Several sterile injectable products 


* | Viagra lost exclusivity in the U.S. in December 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, revenues for Viagra in the U.S. and Canada, which were reported in IH through December 2017, will be reported in EH (which reported all other Viagra revenues excluding the U.S. and Canada through 2017). Therefore, total Viagra worldwide revenues will be reported in EH from 2018 forward.

For a further discussion of these operating segments, see the Innovative Health and Essential Health sections below and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information, including the tables therein captioned Selected Income Statement Information, Geographic Information and Significant Product Revenues, the table captioned Revenues by Segment and Geography in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income section, and the Analysis of Operating Segment Information section in our 2017 Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference.

COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS
We are party to collaboration and/or co-promotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products, including Eliquis, Xtandi and Bavencio. 
Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.
Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi. Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market. In addition, Pfizer and Astellas share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales (recorded in Other (Income)/Deductions––Net). Xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. 
Bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Both companies jointly fund all development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits generated from selling any anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. 
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy
Our R&D priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies and vaccines with the greatest medical and commercial potential, advancing our capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. To that end, our research and development primarily focuses on:

• | Biosimilars;


• | Inflammation and Immunology;


• | Metabolic Disease and Cardiovascular Risks;


• | Oncology;


• | Rare Diseases; and


• | Vaccines.

In January 2018, we announced our decision to end internal neuroscience discovery and early development efforts and re-allocate funding to other areas where we have stronger scientific leadership. We plan to create a dedicated neuroscience venture fund to support continued efforts to advance the field. The development of tanezumab and potential treatments for rare neuromuscular disorders is not impacted by this decision.
While a significant portion of R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations, alliances and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. For additional information on these collaborations, agreements and investments, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Strategy—Description of Research and Development Operations section in our 2017 Financial Report.
Our R&D Operations
We conduct R&D internally and also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. We continue to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. 
Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations. Research Units within our Worldwide Research and Development (WRD) organization are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our IH business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept). Our science-based and other platform-services organizations, where a significant portion of our R&D spending occurs, provide end-to-end scientific and technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRD organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicinal Chemistry, Regulatory and Drug Safety, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Business Technology and Finance. Our R&D organization within the EH business supports the large base of EH products and is expected to develop potential new sterile injectable drugs and therapeutic solutions, as well as biosimilars. Our Global Product Development organization is a unified center for late-stage development for our innovative products and is generally responsible for the operational execution of clinical development of assets that are in clinical trials for our WRD and Innovative portfolios. 
For discussion regarding these R&D matrix organizations and additional information on our R&D operations, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Strategy—Description of Research and Development Operations and Costs and Expenses—Research and Development (R&D) Expenses sections in our 2017 Financial Report.
Our R&D Pipeline and Competition
Innovation is critical to the success of our company, and drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Benchmarking Forum, out of 17 compounds entering preclinical development, on average, only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market (U.S., the EU or Japan). The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development.
As of January 30, 2018, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them.
Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Developments—Biopharmaceutical section in our 2017 Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference.
Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive Products sections below.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
We have significant operations outside the U.S. Operations in developed and emerging markets are managed through our two business segments: IH and EH. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets.
We sell our products in over 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $26.5 billion accounted for 50% of our total revenues in 2017. By total revenues, Japan and China are our two largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table captioned Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information in our 2017 Financial Report, and the table captioned Revenues by Segment and Geography in our 2017 Financial Report. Those tables are incorporated by reference. 
Our international operations are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries, including, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Affecting International Operations below. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws and regulations on pricing, reimbursement, and access to our products. See Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States below for a discussion of these matters.
Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments, depending upon market conditions. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7F. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in our 2017 Financial Report, as well as the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results—Financial Risk Management section in our 2017 Financial Report.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETING
In our global biopharmaceutical businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; Managed Care Organizations that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, Pharmacy Benefit Managers and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistance programs.
Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies, and, in the case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers and individual provider offices. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and MCO formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs. MCOs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We also work with MCOs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines.
In 2017, our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 38% of our total revenues (and approximately 79% of our total U.S. revenues).
% of 2017 Total Revenues and U.S. Revenues from 
Major Biopharmaceutical Wholesalers and Other Customers
Our global Consumer Healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors and agents, principally in smaller markets. The advertising and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television, print, digital and other media advertising, as well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels, including distributors, pharmacies, retail chains and grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business.
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to Pfizer. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.
We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations, product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Intellectual Property below.
In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain therapeutics upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the therapeutic.
In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period and/or the granted patent term extension), are those for the medicines set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

(1) | In addition to the basic product patent covering Viagra, which expired in 2012, Viagra is covered by a U.S. method-of-treatment patent which, including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period associated with Revatio (which has the same active ingredient as Viagra), expires in 2020. As a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. launched a generic version of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017. The corresponding method-of-treatment patent covering Viagra in Japan expired in May 2014.


(2) | For Lyrica, regulatory exclusivity in the EU expired in July 2014.


(3) | Lyrica is covered by a Japanese method-of-use patent which expires in 2022. The patent is currently subject to an invalidation action.


(4) | Xeljanz EU expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity.


(5) | The EU patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 has been revoked following an opposition proceeding. This first instance decision has been appealed. There are other EU patents and pending applications covering the formulation and various aspects of the manufacturing process of Prevenar 13 that remain in force.


(6) | Eucrisa is not approved in the EU and Japan.


(7) | Eliquis was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS.


(8) | Xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas, who has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S.


(9) | Besponsa Japan expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity.


(10) | Bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA.

A number of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. For additional information, including a description of certain of our expired co-promotion agreements, and a further discussion of our products experiencing, or expected to experience in 2018, patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Operating Environment—Industry-Specific Challenges—Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights section in our 2017 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. 
Companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim do not infringe our patents; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Xeljanz and Xtandi. We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A1. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Patent Litigation in our 2017 Financial Report. 
The expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; or conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.
Biotechnology Products
Our biotechnology products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha, Bavencio, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), may face in the future, or already face, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product, Genotropin, which was approved under the FFDCA.
Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and to have no clinically meaningful differences. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists in the U.S. 
In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. 
As part of our business strategy, we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to develop biosimilar medicines. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Biotechnology Products below.
We may face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products. Likewise, as we develop and manufacture biosimilars and seek to launch products, patents may be asserted against us.
International
One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Under international and U.S. free trade agreements in recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Intellectual Property below.
COMPETITION
Our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.
Our competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products.
This competition affects our core product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health and well-being of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients, physicians and global health authorities. We also seek to continually 

Pfizer Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our salespersons’ efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers.
Operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals; and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions.
Our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13-valent or additional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adversely affect our future results.
Our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally, Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s, as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products, as well as biosimilars. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market” position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market. 
Our Consumer Healthcare business faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, and retailers who carry their own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors’ promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors’ introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches).
Managed Care Organizations
The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 291 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States below), the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance.
The influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance to Pfizer.
The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs), clinical protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronic treatments. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOs also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing, copay accumulator programs and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.
Due to their generally lower cost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. MCOs are currently evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formularies.
Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. 

Pfizer Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | 7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. 
The ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA, although the current likelihood of repeal of the ACA appears low given the failure of the Senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of ACA provisions. We are monitoring any such actions to see if any changes to the ACA will be enacted that would impact our business.
Generic Products
One of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. Generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less.
In addition, our patent-protected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.
As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. 
RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. In 2017, we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers. Supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials. No significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2018. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws and regulations that govern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.
General. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies. For additional information on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings in our 2017 Financial Report. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions.
In the United States
Drug Regulation. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling and storage of our products, record keeping, advertising and promotion. Our products are also subject to post-market surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics. The FDA also regulates our Consumer Healthcare products. 
Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products, including OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC. 
Before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic. The steps required before the FDA will approve an NDA or BLA generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor; sponsor submission of the application to the FDA for review; the FDA’s review of the data to assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured. 
Before a generic drug may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an ANDA. The ANDA review process typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved referenced brand drug, submission of an application to the FDA for review, and the FDA’s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured.
As a condition of product approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product. The FDA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market studies and programs. Any modifications to a drug or biologic, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental NDA or BLA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to cGMPs, which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Biosimilar Regulation. The ACA created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference, innovator biologic. 
The FDA is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars. Through those approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance, the FDA has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a non-U.S.-licensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity and/or interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Over the next several years, the FDA is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars. In addition, in 2017, the Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for a five-year period, which should lead to a significant increase in the FDA’s biosimilar user fee revenues, thereby providing the FDA with additional resources to process biosimilar applications. Also, there have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if those efforts continue in 2018 and if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.
Sales and Marketing. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods (including drugs) or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federal government and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.
Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Overview section in our 2017 Financial Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1G. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2017 Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference.
Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products in certain states. As another example, access to our products under the Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries. Given certain states’ current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chains and wholesalers, who are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the U.S., will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us.
Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Recent legislation enacted includes, for example, a 2017 Maryland law that prohibits a generic drug manufacturer or wholesale distributor from engaging in price gouging in the sale of certain off-patent or generic drugs, and a 2017 California law that requires manufacturers to provide advanced notification of price increases to certain purchasers and report specified drug pricing information to the state. Certain state legislation, like the Maryland law, has been subject to legal challenges.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We will continue to work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system.
Healthcare Reform. The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA that expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance exchanges and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.
Under President Trump’s administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA, although the current likelihood of repeal of the ACA appears low given the failure of the Senate’s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of ACA provisions. In October 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the plans would not have to meet all of the ACA’s coverage requirements, and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees. In December 2017, the comprehensive tax reform package signed into law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes a provision that effectively repealed the ACA’s individual mandate by removing the penalties. These and similar actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer Americans having comprehensive ACA-compliant health insurance, even in the absence of a full legislative repeal. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the ACA are minor, so the impact of the recent administration actions is expected to be limited. We also may face uncertainties if our industry is looked to for savings to fund certain legislation, such as lifting the debt ceiling. One recent example is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the discount we pay in the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, which will modestly reduce our future Medicare Part D revenues.
We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the ACA or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
Outside the United States
We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. 
New Drug Approvals. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The Centralized Procedure, managed by the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the EU and is the one most commonly used for new products.
In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in Japan. The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.
Historically, China’s regulatory system has presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, as its requirements for drug development and registration have not always been consistent with U.S. or other international standards. The CFDA, however, has introduced reforms and draft reforms in recent years, which are discussed in more detail below, that attempt to address these challenges, with 2017 being an especially active year in this respect. In the past, it has been common to see treatments entering the Chinese market two to eight years behind first marketing in the U.S. and Europe, because historically China has only issued import drug licenses to treatments approved by mature regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMA. In addition, to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs in China, a clinical trial authorization issued by the CFDA has historically been required for the conduct of Phase I to III clinical trials. Applications for approval of imported drugs that included China-originated data in their Multi-Regional Clinical Trials and met the relevant technical review requirements were allowed to receive local clinical trial waivers on a case-by-case basis. Historically, oral generics only had to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA, while sterile injectable generics often needed local confirmatory trials for regulatory approval. A Chinese drug license would only be granted if, following review, the CFDA determines that the clinical data confirm the drug’s safety and effectiveness. 
Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S. and Europe.
Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, there is detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance, which has been increased and strengthened in recent years. The EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. EU regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.
Pricing and Reimbursement. In Europe, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets, governments provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. Governments, including the different EU Member States, may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries, varying health outcomes and some third-party trade in our products between countries.
In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and can hinder patient access and innovation. Price variations, exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some European countries.
In addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations (e.g., 2016 UN High Level Panel Report on Access to Medicines and 2017 OECD Report on New Health Technologies—Managing Access, Value and Sustainability). Government adoption of these recommendations may lead to additional pricing pressures.
In Japan, the government recently released a basic framework for pharmaceutical pricing that will lead to the adoption of cost effectiveness assessments in some form, quarterly pricing reviews for new indications, and severe narrowing of the criteria to gain a price maintenance premium. In China, despite removal of government-set price caps the government continues to exercise indirect price control by setting reimbursement standards through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insurance administrations. Provincial biddings, cross-regional procurement and secondary hospital price negotiations are likely to intensify as government cost containment efforts continue. 
EU Regulatory Changes. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect some time in late 2019. This regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results.
Under its Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products for Human Use policy, the EMA proactively publishes clinical trial data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations, including data from trials taking place outside the EU, after the EMA has made a decision on the marketing authorization. The policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data. 
Brexit. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. In March 2017, the U.K. government formally notified the European Council of its intention to leave the EU after it triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to begin the two-year negotiation process establishing the terms of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU. Formal negotiations officially started in June 2017. This process continues to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiations may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval and supply of our products. It was announced in November 2017 that the EMA will be relocating from London, U.K. to Amsterdam, Netherlands by the expected date of Brexit in March 2019. At present, it is still unclear whether and to what extent the U.K. will remain within or aligned to the EU system of medicines regulation, and/or what separate requirements will be imposed in the U.K. after it leaves the EU. For additional information on Brexit, see the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources—Global Economic Conditions—U.K. in our 2017 Financial Report.
China Regulatory Changes. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval, the CFDA has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for China’s drug approval system, and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities. The CFDA now divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from “China New” to “Global New.” This means that drugs previously approved in other markets (such as the U.S. or Europe) will not be considered new drugs under China’s regulatory regime, with the exception of drugs introduced within one year of approval in mature markets. This change in definition creates more opportunities for China’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms, because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of China. The 2017 revisions made clear, however, that regulatory approval from the FDA or the EMA would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs, though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines, which still require prior approval from a relevant regulatory agency. The “marketing authorization holder” system, which will allow for more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers, now applies to all drugs developed and manufactured in China, but not yet to imported drugs.
While challenges remain, a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in China. These reforms, along with China’s June 2017 entry into the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, are expected to pave the way for integration of CFDA’s regulations with global practices. These changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), a filing/recordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics (instead of the original review and approval system), admitting more categories of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track/“green channel” approval pathway and ongoing implementation of previously announced regulatory reforms.
Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. A number of countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, the EFPIA’s disclosure code requires all members, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. 
Intellectual Property. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (WTO-TRIPS) required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developed countries. While we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, some countries have made improvements. We include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries. 
While the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. There is considerable political and economic pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions (e.g., new medical treatment methods), revocation of patents, issuance (and threat of issuance) of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers, as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries. In developed countries as well, including the EU, we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment.
Canada’s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA), Canadian authorities reluctantly agreed to introduce a right of appeal, a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation, further aligning its intellectual property regime to the EU. In particular, CETA Article 20.25 provides sui generis protection for patent term extensions of two to five years for basic patents, subject to various rules and limitations.
In China, the intellectual property environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. The government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, including Pfizer, have established R&D centers in China due to increased confidence in China’s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on the U.S. Trade Representative’s Priority Watch List for 2017. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent. For example, the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage.
In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil), restrictive patentability rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents. The lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products.
In India, we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement. Despite these positive steps, gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns. For example, policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents, the tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings (both pre- and post-grant), and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation. These policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population. Challenges against Pfizer patents in India are ongoing.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Most of our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17A3. Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Proceedings—Commercial and Other Matters in our 2017 Financial Report. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2017 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

• | environment-related capital expenditures— $30 million; and


• | other environment-related expenses— $142 million.

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.
Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. For example, in 2017, our manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by hurricanes. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Business—Impact of Recent Hurricanes in Puerto Rico section of the 2017 Financial Report. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term.
TAX MATTERS
The discussion of tax-related matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5. Tax Matters in our 2017 Financial Report, is incorporated by reference.
EMPLOYEES
In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 90,200 people in our operations throughout the world.
