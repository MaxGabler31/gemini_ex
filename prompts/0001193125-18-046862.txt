Mission 
 Our mission is to build the largest, most trusted and vibrant home-related marketplace in the world. 
 Overview 
 Zillow Group, Inc. operates the leading real estate and home-related information marketplaces on mobile and the web, with a complementary portfolio of brands and products to help people find vital information about homes and connect with local professionals. Zillow Groups brands focus on all stages of the home lifecycle: buying, selling, renting and financing. The Zillow Group portfolio of consumer brands includes real estate and rental marketplaces Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy, HotPads, Naked Apartments, RealEstate.com and OutEast.com. In addition, Zillow Group provides a comprehensive suite of marketing software and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals maximize business opportunities and connect with millions of consumers. We also own and operate a number of business brands for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals, including Mortech, dotloop, Bridge Interactive and New Home Feed. Zillow, Inc. was incorporated as a Washington corporation in December 2004, and we launched the initial version of our website, Zillow.com, in February 2006. Zillow Group, Inc. was incorporated as a Washington corporation in July 2014 in connection with our acquisition of Trulia. Upon the closing of the Trulia acquisition in February 2015, each of Zillow and Trulia became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group. 
 Our living database of more than 110 million U.S. homesincluding homes for sale, homes for rent and homes not currently on the marketattracts an active and vibrant community of users. Individuals and businesses that use Zillows mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 75 million homes, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. These profiles include detailed information about homes, including property facts, listing information and purchase and sale data. Using complex, proprietary automated valuation models, we provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes. We provide this information to our users where, when and how they want it, through our industry-leading mobile applications and websites. 
 Consumers increasingly are turning to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information. Traffic to Zillow Group brands mobile applications and websites reached a seasonal peak of more than 187 million monthly unique users in July 2017, an increase of 10% year over year. Visits increased by 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For additional information regarding unique users and visits, see Unique Users and Visits in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. More than two-thirds of our flagship brand Zillows usage occurs on a mobile device; on weekends its more than 75%. We operate one of the most popular suites of mobile real estate applications with more than fifty applications across all major mobile platforms. For example, on our flagship Zillow brand, during December 2017, nearly 630 million homes were viewed on a mobile device, or 234 homes per second. We monetize our marketplace business on mobile in the same way we do on our web platform. 
 Real estate, rental and mortgage professionals are a critical part of home-related marketplaces. We have created a trusted and transparent marketplace where consumers can search and read reviews on local real estate, rental and mortgage professionals and contact those professionals on their own terms. 
 Our home-related marketplaces benefit from network effects. As more consumers come to our mobile applications and websites to use our products and services, more real estate, rental and mortgage professionals contribute content to distinguish themselves, thereby making our marketplaces more useful and attracting

 additional consumers. As of December 31, 2017, we had published more than 3.5 million reviews, including more than 3.0 million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately 495,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by our users on Zillow. 
 Our revenue has grown significantly since our initial website launch in 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated revenue of $1,076.8 million, as compared to $846.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 27%. We generate revenue from the sale of advertising services and our suite of marketing software and technology solutions to businesses and professionals primarily associated with the residential real estate, mortgage and rental industries. These professionals include real estate, mortgage and rental professionals and brand advertisers. Our two primary revenue categories are marketplace revenue and display revenue. 
 Marketplace revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 consists of Premier Agent revenue, other real estate revenue and mortgages revenue. Premier Agent revenue is generated by the sale of advertising under our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs, which offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. We offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users of our mobile applications and websites. Other real estate revenue primarily includes revenue generated by Zillow Group Rentals, as well as revenue from the sale of various other marketing and business products and services to real estate professionals, including our new construction marketing solutions. Zillow Group Rentals includes our rentals marketplace and suite of tools for rental professionals. Rentals revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to property managers and other rental professionals on a cost per lead, cost per lease and cost per click generated basis. Our new construction marketing solutions allow home builders to showcase their available inventory to home shoppers. New construction revenue primarily includes revenue generated by advertising sold to builders on a cost per residential community basis. Mortgages revenue primarily includes advertising sold to mortgage lenders and other mortgage professionals, including our Long Form and Custom Quote services, as well as revenue generated by Mortech, which provides subscription-based mortgage software solutions, including a product and pricing engine and lead management platform. 
 Display revenue primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. Our advertising customers also include telecommunications, automotive, insurance and consumer products companies. 
 On February 17, 2015, Zillow Group acquired Trulia, and Trulia and Zillow became wholly owned subsidiaries of Zillow Group. We have included Trulia in Zillow Groups results of operations prospectively after February 17, 2015, the date of acquisition. Because the Trulia acquisition occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015, the information presented in this report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to Zillow on a standalone basis prior to February 17, 2015 and to Zillow Group after February 17, 2015, whereas the information presented in this report with respect to the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to Zillow Group. Results of operations, including Marketplace revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015 also include the Market Leader business from February 17, 2015 through the date of divestiture of September 30, 2015. As a result, comparisons to the prior-year period may not be indicative of future results or future rates of growth. 
 Portions of our business may be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the residential real estate market, advertising spending, and other factors. We believe our rapid growth may be masking the underlying seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate slows, we expect seasonal variances may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015,

 costs and expenses peaked in the three months ended June 30th, primarily attributable to increases in sales and marketing expenses which were, in turn, primarily attributable to increased investment in marketing and advertising initiatives to attract consumers across online and offline channels during peak seasons for home sales activity. In addition, the average number of unique users and visits have historically peaked during the three months ended June 30th or September 30th, also consistent with peak residential real estate activity in the spring and summer months. Because the number of unique users and visits may impact impression inventory, leads to real estate professionals, and graphical display inventory which we monetize, this trend in the average number of unique users and visits may result in seasonality of revenue. 
 Industry Dynamics 
 The Importance of Homes 
 Homes are the center of peoples lives, the focus of some of their most important decisions and often their most valuable assets. In addition to whether to buy, sell or rent, consumers frequently make many other important home-related decisions, including decisions relating to home financing and home equity loans. Residential real estate is one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy and supports millions of professionals that provide services related to home purchases and sales, rentals and home financings. 
Large Market Opportunities 
 Based on external and internal assessments, we believe our current addressable markets include the following: 
 Purchase and SaleSales of approximately 5.5 million existing and 608 thousand new homes in the United States in 2017 had an aggregate transaction value of approximately $1.8 trillion, according to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Census Bureau and in 2018 by the National Association of REALTORS®. In an effort to acquire new client relationships and sell homes, U.S. real estate agents and brokers spent an estimated $7.2 billion on residential advertising in 2017, according to a forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2017. In addition, U.S. real estate developers spent an estimated $1.1 billion on residential advertising in 2017, also according to a forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2017. In the United States, there are 208.6 million people residing in owner-occupied housing, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in November 2017. Approximately 33% of movers in 2017, or 11.5 million people, were homeowners, according to the U.S. Census Bureau migration data published in November 2017. 
 RentalsIn the fourth quarter of 2017, there were approximately 46.2 million rental housing units in the United States, with a national vacancy rate of 6.9%, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2018. According to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau from the American Housing Survey and the Current Population Survey/Housing Vacancy Survey, approximately: 

 | 10.1% of rental units (4.7 million) are located in buildings with 50 or more units;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 8.0% of rental units (3.7 million) are located in buildings with 20 to 49 units;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 9.9% of rental units (4.6 million) are located in buildings with 10 to 19 units;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 10.9% of rental units (5.0 million) are located in buildings with 5 to 9 units;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 17.3% of rental units (8.0 million) are located in small multi-family structures of 2-4 units;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 43.8% of rental units (20.2 million) are 1-unit structures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 According to a forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2017, U.S. rental property managers spent an estimated $2.7 billion on advertising in 2017, which excludes lease concessions. In the United States, there are 108.0 million people residing in rental housing units, according to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017. Approximately 67% of movers in 2017, or 23.4 million people, were renters, according to the U.S. Census Bureau migration data published in November 2017. 
 
5 
 
Home FinancingAccording to a forecast from the Mortgage Bankers Association published in January 2018, approximately $1.7 trillion in U.S. residential mortgage originations occurred in 2017. U.S. residential mortgage providers spent approximately $6.6 billion in 2017 marketing their services and loan products to mortgage borrowers, according to a forecast from Borrell Associates released in 2017. 
Highly Fragmented, Local and Complex Market 
 The market for residential real estate transactions and home-related services is highly fragmented, local and complex. Each home has unique characteristics, including location, value, size, style, age and condition. Each consumer approaches home-related transactions with a personal set of objectives, priorities and values. Real estate agents generally operate in local markets as independent contractors with different experiences and skills. These conditions create challenges for consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals alike. Consumers are challenged to find information about homes and to find real estate, rental and mortgage professionals who fit their individual needs. Real estate, rental and mortgage professionals are challenged to efficiently advertise their services and identify new clients, and to measure the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. 
Absence of Consumer Orientation 
 Historically, consumers had minimal access to comprehensive and objective residential real estate data, even though many home-related decisions are extraordinarily information-intensive. While real estate, rental and mortgage professionals had some data, consumers did not have free, independent and easy access to data. Even when accessible, the data were difficult to interpret and analyze. 
Increasing Role of Mobile Technologies and the Internet 
 Consumers are increasingly turning to mobile devices and the internet to access real estate information. With the widespread adoption of mobile and location-based technologies, consumers increasingly expect home-related information to be available on their mobile devices where, when and how they want it. According to comScore data published in December 2017, Zillow Group brands represent nearly three quarters of market share of all mobile exclusive visitors to the real estate category. More than two-thirds of our flagship brand Zillows usage occurs on a mobile device; on weekends its more than 75%. We believe that the technological platform shift from desktop computers to mobile devices benefits technology leaders like Zillow Group that are quick to innovate. In 2017, we unveiled a new, first-of-its-kind, mobile app that allows homeowners and real estate professionals to capture 3D tours of their homes from their iPhones® and post on for-sale and for-rent listings.
 Competitive Advantages 
 We believe we have the following competitive advantages: 
 

 | Powerful Brand and Scale. We have established a powerful brand identity that includes a portfolio of the largest and most vibrant brands, and we have built a large user community. The majority of our traffic comes direct, not dependent on search engines, with demonstrated consumer intent to visit Zillow Groups brands. Traffic to Zillow Group brands mobile applications and websites reached a seasonal peak of more than 187 million monthly unique users in July 2017, an increase of 10% year over year. Visits to Zillow Group brands mobile applications and websites, including Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com, increased 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For additional information regarding unique users and visits, see Unique Users and Visits in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 | Inimitable Database of Homes. Our living database of homes is the result of years of substantial investment, sophisticated economic and statistical analysis, complex data aggregation and millions of

user contributions. Our dynamic and comprehensive living database includes detailed information on more than 110 million U.S. homes, and includes homes for sale, for rent and recently sold, as well as properties not currently on the market. This database is central to the value we provide to consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals. It contains extensive information that users can search, through an easy-to-use interface, to identify, analyze and compare homes. Our database is relevant to a broad range of users, including buyers, sellers, renters, homeowners, real estate agents and other real estate professionals. It includes information such as:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Property facts: Zestimate and its corresponding value range, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, lot size, assessed tax value and property type such as single-family, condominium, apartment, multifamily, manufactured home or land.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Listing information: price, price history and reductions, dollars per square foot, days on the market, listing type (such as for sale by agent, for sale by owner, pre-market inventory, which includes foreclosure, pre-foreclosure, Coming Soon and Make Me Move listings, new construction and rental homes), open houses, property photos and estimated monthly mortgage payment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Purchase and sale data: prior sales information and recent sales nearby.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We synthesize data from hundreds of automated feeds, representing information from tens of thousands of public and private sources. Applying extensive computer analytics to the data, we transform it into information that is accessible, understandable and useful. 
 We refer to the database as living because the information is continually updated by the combination of our proprietary algorithms, synthesis of third-party data from hundreds of sources, and through improvements by us and, importantly, by our community of users. User-generated content from owners, agents and others enriches our database with photos, videos, and additional property information. Individuals and businesses that use Zillows mobile applications and websites have updated information on more than 75 million homes in our database, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. Our inimitable database enables us to create content, products and services not available anywhere else, and attracts an active, vibrant community of users. As of December 31, 2017, we had published more than 3.5 million reviews, including more than 3.0 million reviews of local real estate agents and approximately 495,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by our users on Zillow. 
 

 | Zestimates and Rent Zestimates. We have developed industry-leading automated home valuation models that use advanced statistical methods and complex, proprietary algorithms. We use these models to provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, and current rental price estimates, or Rent Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes. Based on our Zestimates, we produce Zillow Home Value Indexes at the neighborhood, zip code, city, metropolitan statistical area, county and national levels. Our Zillow Home Value Indexes have been cited by government entities such as the Federal Reserve Bank and the Congressional Oversight Panel, university studies and respected national publications. For historical comparisons, we provide up to 15 years of Zestimate history on each home and valuable information about property and real estate market trends. Our Zestimates, Rent Zestimates and Zillow Home Value Indexes allow consumers to evaluate homes and neighborhoods, and to easily evaluate historical trends, as they contemplate critical home-related decisions.

 | Mobile Leadership and Monetization. Shopping for a home is a far more meaningful consumer experience when it occurs curbside, untethered and on location, so we have developed and operate the most popular suite of mobile real estate applications across all major platforms. For example, on our flagship Zillow brand, during December 2017, nearly 630 million homes, or 234 homes per second, were viewed on a mobile device. More than two-thirds of our flagship brand Zillows usage occurs on a mobile device; on weekends its more than 75%. We operate one of the most popular suites of mobile real estate applications with more than fifty applications across all major mobile platforms. In 2017, we

unveiled a new, first-of-its-kind, mobile app that allows homeowners and real estate professionals to capture 3D tours of their homes from their iPhones® and post on for-sale and for-rent listings. We monetize our marketplace business on our mobile platform in the same way we do on our web platform.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Independent Market Positions and Consumer Focus. Zillow Group has been built independent of any real estate industry group. We maintain an unwavering commitment to giving consumers free access to as much useful information as possible. We provide unbiased information, products and services, empowering consumers to make informed decisions about homes and the residential real estate market. We believe our independence enables us to create compelling products and services with broad consumer appeal.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Multiple Robust Home-Related Marketplaces. We have created trusted and transparent marketplaces in real estate, rentals and mortgages where consumers can identify and connect with local professionals that are best suited to meet their needs. Our living database of homes provides a foundation on which we can build new consumer and professional marketplaces in other home-related categories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Technology Solutions for Professionals. We offer a suite of marketing and technology solutions to help real estate, rental and mortgage professionals grow their businesses and personal brands including our Premier Agent app that allows real estate professionals to manage their business from wherever they are, dotloop that has digitized the real estate transaction, and Bridge Interactive which has streamlined listing data management.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Consumer-Oriented Mortgage Marketplace. Unlike other sources of mortgage rate quotes, consumers can anonymously submit mortgage loan information requests and receive an unlimited number of personalized mortgage quotes directly from hundreds of consumer-rated lenders. Because we operate this marketplace as part of our real estate home shopping experience, we can efficiently attract motivated users to the marketplace and prioritize the consumers experience. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Personalized Experience. We present homebuyers and sellers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with many opportunities to personalize their Zillow Group experience, leading to more informed home shopping and financing decisions. As immediacy is paramount in the home search experience, all Zillow Group mobile applications and websites empower users by allowing them to set the criteria that matters most to them, while we take on the action of alerting them when a home or rental that matches their criteria hits the market. Whether it is through an email, desktop notification, Apple Watch® alert or Facebook® chatbot, we keep users updated on the most current home information available in our marketplace.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proven Management Team. We believe the broad experience and depth of our management team are distinct competitive advantages in the complex and evolving industry in which we compete. The Zillow Group management team has an extensive history building successful consumer internet companies. In particular, we believe that the shared experience of our executives, many of whom have worked together at Zillow Group for the better part of a decade, provides our management team with unique cohesion and insight.

 | Enhance Our Living Database of Homes. Enhance the information in our database of more than 110 million homes, and use it as the foundation for new analyses, insights and tools to inform consumers throughout the home ownership lifecycle. Our living database of homes provides a foundation on which we can build new consumer and professional marketplaces in other home-related categories.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our growth strategies support our strategic priorities for the year ended December 31, 2017, which include growing the size of, and increasing engagement with, our consumer audience; continuing to grow our Premier Agent revenue; growing our emerging marketplaces, and maintaining our extraordinary company culture, which attracts and retains incredible people and motivates them to do their best work. Our growth strategies also support our strategic priorities as we look ahead to 2018, which include growing our audience size and increasing engagement across our brands; creating better experiences for consumers and more efficiency for our real estate industry partners; evolving our revenue models to better align our results with transactions and our industry partners commissions; and attracting and retaining the best talent and leveraging our unique company culture focused on innovation as a competitive advantage. 
 Advertising Products and Services 
 We provide advertising products and services for real estate, rental and mortgage professionals that enable them to create and promote useful content for consumers. 
 Marketplace Advertising 
 Premier Agent and Premier Broker Program 
 Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker programs offer a suite of marketing and business technology products and services to help real estate agents and brokers achieve their advertising needs, while growing and managing their businesses and brands. All Premier Agents and Premier Brokers receive access to a dashboard portal on our mobile application or website that provides individualized program performance analytics, self-service ad buying tools and our free customer relationship management, or CRM, tool that captures detailed information about each contact made with a Premier Agent or Premier Broker through our mobile and web platforms. 
 We offer our flagship Premier Agent advertising product and our Premier Broker advertising product on a cost per impression basis. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears on pages viewed by users

 of our mobile applications and websites. In 2016, we began testing and implementation of a new auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product by which we determine the cost per impression delivered in each zip code based upon the total amount spent by Premier Agents to purchase impressions in the zip code during the month. The cost per impression that we charge is dynamic  as demand for impressions in a zip code increases or decreases, the cost per impression in that zip code may be increased or decreased. This new auction-based pricing method complements our self-serve account interface, which we introduced to Premier Agents over the course of 2016. The interface includes account management tools that allow agent advertisers to independently control their budgets, impression buys, and the duration of their advertising commitment. We began testing this auction-based pricing method for our Premier Agent product to better align our revenue opportunities with increasing traffic levels to our mobile and web platforms and leveraging increasing demand by real estate agents for access to home shoppers who use our mobile applications and websites. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented this method broadly for all existing and new agent advertisers, including brokerages and other teams. With this auction-based pricing method, we recognize revenue related to our dynamic impression-based Premier Agent and Premier Broker products based on the contractual maximum spend on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. Our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products include multiple deliverables which are accounted for as a single unit of accounting, as the delivery or performance of the undelivered elements is based on traffic to our mobile applications and websites. In our history of building our real estate and other information marketplaces and product offerings, we have continually evaluated and utilized various pricing and value delivery strategies in order to better align our revenue opportunities with the growth in usage of our mobile and web platforms. 
 We continue to support some legacy Trulia Premier Agent products, which are primarily sold on a fixed fee subscription basis for periods that generally range from six months to 12 months. Subscription advertising revenue for Trulias products included in Premier Agent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis during the contractual period over which the services are delivered. 
 Our Premier Agent App gives agents the freedom to work anywhere by allowing them to manage their contacts, reviews and listings from their mobile device, and provides the ability to automatically add and manage leads from third party sources. The Premier Agent App is designed to make agents more efficient by giving them a fast, streamlined way to manage their incoming contacts from Zillow and Trulia, as well as the ability to manage their listings, reviews and their profile on Zillow and Trulia.
 Instant Offers 
 In 2017, we began testing the Zillow Instant Offers marketplace, a way for homeowners to sell their homes quickly by providing them with offers from investors and a comparative market analysis from a local real estate agent, as an estimate for what the home might fetch on the open market. In addition to investors being required to use an agent, should a homeowner select an investors offer, Zillow will also offer to connect them with a local agent to represent them throughout the transaction. 
Mortgages 
 We offer two mortgage advertising products  Long Form and Custom Quotes. In Zillow Groups Long Form platform, consumers answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive contacts based on data such as location and customer reviews. In our Custom Quotes mortgage marketing platform, lending institutions display their mortgage rates directly to consumers who are shopping for refinance and purchase rates. In Custom Quotes, consumers request free, personalized quotes in response to their submission of limited anonymous data, such as specific loan amount, zip code, purchase price or estimated home value, and credit score. Consumers decide if and when to contact the mortgage professionals who provide quotes. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers through Long Form and Custom Quotes. User-generated ratings and reviews of mortgage professionals are provided as a powerful tool to help consumers shop

 for their loans. Our Long Form and Custom Quote services are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc., a licensed mortgage broker, pursuant to a support services agreement. 
 Zillow Group Rentals 
 Zillow Group continues to develop its rental marketplace across mobile, web, and a diverse set of apps that serve both consumers and rental professionals. Zillow Group Rentals is the largest rental network on the internet and includes listing distribution across Zillow, Trulia and HotPads, reaching millions of rental shoppers each month. Zillow Group Rentals advertisers gain access to the leading technology and marketing platform that connects rental properties with consumer contacts.
Zillow Group New Construction 
 Zillow Groups new construction marketing platform, Promoted Communities, allows home builders to showcase their available inventory to our millions of in-market home shoppers across the web. Promoted Communities continues to drive discoverability for home builders through dynamic listings of their available lots, plans, and spec homes, while our Builder Boost products with Precision Targeting let home builders enhance their communitys presence on Zillow, Trulia and Facebook®. Zillow Group marketing partners also receive exclusive access to robust data and consumer insights to help them make informed marketing decisions.

 Our display advertising primarily consists of graphical mobile and web advertising sold on a cost per thousand impressions or cost per click basis to advertisers promoting their brands on our mobile applications and websites and our partner websites and mobile applications, primarily in the real estate industry, including real estate brokerages, multi-family rental professionals, mortgage professionals and home services providers. We offer customers display advertising opportunities on our mobile applications through display ads that are optimized for the mobile experience, on our home page, and on individual web pages, through graphical displays and text links. 
Information Products and Services 
 We provide consumers with information products and services to enable them to make intelligent decisions about homes. 
 Zestimates and Rent Zestimates 
 Our Zestimate and Rent Zestimate valuations are computed using complex, proprietary algorithms we have developed and refined through years of statistical analysis and technological development. 
 A Zestimate is our estimated current market value of a home. We generate Zestimates using a variety of information, including: 
 

 | Physical attributes: location, lot size, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and many other details.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tax assessments: property tax information, actual property taxes paid, exceptions to tax assessments and other information provided in the tax assessors records.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Prior and current transactions: actual sale prices over time of the home itself and comparable recent sales of nearby homes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | User data: data provided directly by millions of users of our mobile applications and websites.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use proprietary automated valuation models that apply advanced algorithms to analyze our data to identify relationships within a specific geographic area between home-related data and actual sales prices. We provide current home value estimates, or Zestimates, on approximately 100 million U.S. homes. Home characteristics, such as square footage, location or the number of bathrooms, are given different weights according to their influence on home sale prices in each specific geographic area over a specific period of time, resulting in a set of valuation rules, or models, that are applied to generate each homes Zestimate. 
 To improve the accuracy of our Zestimates, our algorithms automatically remove or reconcile data that would otherwise inappropriately skew the valuation rules. In addition, our algorithms will automatically generate a new set of valuation rules based on the constantly changing universe of data included in our database. This allows us to provide timely home value information on a massive scale, updated daily. In 2017, we announced Zillow Prize, a machine learning competition to improve Zestimate accuracy, with a grand prize of up to $1 million to the person or team who submits the most improved the Zestimate algorithm model. 
 We publicly disclose the accuracy of our Zestimates to further empower consumers in assessing a homes value. The accuracy may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the amount of data about homes we have for a particular geographic area. 
 A Rent Zestimate is our estimated current monthly rental price of a home, computed using similar automated valuation models we have designed to address the unique attributes of a rental home. We estimate rental prices on approximately 100 million homes, including apartments, single-family homes, condominiums and townhomes. Our Rent Zestimates are updated daily.

 Consumers and real estate professionals can update property information by, for example, adding home photos and personalized information regarding the neighborhood or school district, creating exclusive home profiles not available anywhere else. 
 Our map-based user interface enables our users to search, navigate and zoom to areas of interest and find and compare home information quickly and efficiently from a variety of different perspectives across homes, neighborhoods, cities, counties and other geographic regions. Our consumer search experience supports complex search queries and filters across our data set of homes, allowing consumers to customize their searches and gain actionable insights. 
 Our team of economists and statisticians generates unbiased local and national real estate data and analysis on 916 metropolitan areas and approximately 16,800 individual neighborhoods that we provide to consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals at no cost. This gives our users access to local market trends and data, such as home price cuts, list to sale price ratio and foreclosure data that was historically not easily obtained, if available at all. Users can compare these metrics across neighborhoods and different time periods using our real-time charting and filtering. 
 For Sale and Rental Listings 
 We provide comprehensive for sale and rental listings through relationships with real estate brokerages, real estate listings aggregators, multiple listing services, apartment management companies, home builders and other third parties. In addition, we provide consumers with access to exclusive home listings, such as our Make Me Move listings, which are a homeowners posted price at which they would be willing to move. We also show listings that may not be available on other sources, including for sale by owner, pre-market inventory, including our Coming Soon listings, and rental listings. Real estate agents and landlords may feature and gain more exposure for their listings through our advertising products.

Marketplace of Real Estate Agents 
 We present consumers with ratings and contact information for the listing agent and local buyers agents alongside home profiles and listings for homes to assist them in evaluating and selecting the real estate agent best suited for them. We enhance this offering by providing an online professional directory for consumers to search and contact real estate professionals that they might wish to engage. Our directory includes rich profiles of real estate professionals, including more than 3.0 million ratings and reviews provided by our users, allowing consumers to evaluate these agents based on a number of criteria, including neighborhood specialization and number of listings. 
Marketplace of Mortgage Professionals 
 In our mortgages marketplace, consumers can answer a series of questions to find a local lender, and mortgage professionals receive contacts based on data such as location and customer reviews, or consumers can anonymously request free, personalized mortgage quotes from consumer-rated-and-reviewed mortgage professionals. Consumers can then choose to contact those mortgage professionals at their discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there were approximately 22.7 million mortgage loan information requests submitted on Zillow Group platforms by consumers. More than half of consumers who submit a loan information request do so on a mobile device. As of December 31, 2017, we had published approximately 495,000 reviews of mortgage professionals submitted by our consumers. 
Mobile Access 
 We operate one of the most popular suites of mobile real estate applications with more than fifty applications across all major mobile platforms. Our mobile real estate applications provide consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with location-based access to many of our products and services, including Zestimates, Rent Zestimates, for sale and rental listings and extensive home-related data. Through our mobile applications, for example, a consumer can learn about the homes for-sale price, Zestimate, number of bedrooms, square footage and past sales, as well as similar information about surrounding homes. The consumer can call a real estate professional through our mobile applications to get more information or schedule a showing. For example, on our flagship Zillow brand, during December 2017, nearly 630 million homes were viewed on a mobile device, which equates to 234 homes per second. 
Marketing 
 We believe Zillow Group has considerable opportunity to increase brand awareness and grow traffic through product development, targeted advertising programs and strategic partnerships. As such, we opportunistically advertise to consumers and professionals in various online and offline channels that have tested well for us and pursue strategic partnerships that drive traffic and brand awareness for Zillow Group. 
 At Zillow Group, marketing begins with effective product development, which then becomes amplified by impactful brand advertising and marketing communications. We create immersive consumer products that people want to use frequently, talk about and share. The engaging nature of our products enables us to execute compelling advertising campaigns integrated with our robust and viral communications program, which together comprise the primary drivers of our brand awareness and traffic acquisition efforts. For example, for our flagship Zillow brand, we launched our consumer brand with communications at the core of our marketing strategy. Next, after years of vigorous field testing, we began large-scale national advertising in early 2013 on television and across other complementary channels, which has continued through the year ended December 31, 2017. In part as a result of these advertising efforts, traffic to Zillow Group brands mobile applications and websites reached a seasonal peak of more than 187 million monthly unique users in July 2017, an increase of 10% year over year. Visits to Zillow Group brands mobile applications and websites, including Zillow, Trulia, StreetEasy and RealEstate.com, increased 19% to 6,314.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of our traffic and brand awareness comes direct, not dependent on search engines, with demonstrated consumer intent to visit the Zillow Group brands.

The communications team for our flagship Zillow brand includes former print and broadcast journalists who have established Zillow Group as an authoritative source for information on a broad range of home and real estate-related subjects. A typical week includes commentary from our real estate experts across dozens of national print and broadcast media outlets, guest opinion pieces or blog posts by our chief economists, and wide-ranging national and local media coverage of Zillow Group products, listings, data and consumer tips. We also produce considerable home and real estate-related content on our blogs that are syndicated across dozens of prominent media sites with content ranging from real estate market trends, to home financing tips, to celebrity real estate listings. 
 In September 2017, we released the second annual Zillow Group Report on Consumer Housing Trends, which highlights our latest consumer research. The report has garnered the attention of media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Fox Business, Associated Press and Money Magazine and serves to establish Zillow Group as the authority on residential real estate consumers and their needs, aspirations and challenges. 
 We focus substantial public relations effort around the marketing of our Zillow Real Estate Market Reports, which are in-depth reports produced by our economics and analytics bureau for 905 U.S. markets. Data is released on a monthly and quarterly basis, and the data is widely used by government entities such as the Federal Reserve and Congressional Oversight Panel, as well as regularly featured in respected media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Bloomberg, Reuters and across numerous national network and cable news shows including CNBC, CNN, Fox News and Bloomberg. We believe the considerable effort we have spent on public relations and social media has allowed us to build large and credible brands. 
 Our living database of homes creates significant opportunities for home-ownership lifecycle marketing. A typical person will at various times in life be a renter, buyer, homeowner, mortgage refinancer or seller, and this presents opportunities to communicate with consumers over many years before, during and after a transaction. We actively communicate with our users through email and social media channels. 
 Sales, Consumer Care and Customer Support 
 Our sales teams are responsible for generating advertising customers across our mobile applications and websites. 
 Our largest sales teams sell our Premier Agent and Premier Broker products to real estate agents, and are located in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, Irvine, California, and New York, New York. We also have sales teams in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, New York, New York, and Irvine, California that sell our rental products to rental professionals. In addition, we have sales teams in Seattle, Washington and Lincoln, Nebraska that support sales in our mortgage marketplaces. We also have sales teams in Seattle, Washington, Denver, Colorado, and San Francisco, California that sell our new construction marketing solutions. We attract customers through a combination of outbound calling and inbound customer requests generated from our websites and event marketing activities. We also maintain field sales teams in San Francisco, California and New York, New York to specifically target larger advertising customers in the real estate and related content categories, such as real estate brokerages, home builders, lenders and home service providers, as well as advertisers in the telecommunications, automotive, insurance and other industries. 
 We believe that consumer care and customer support are important to our success. Our consumer care and customer support teams are located in Seattle, Washington and Denver, Colorado. Our customer support team responds to commercial and technical issues from our advertisers, and our consumer care team responds to consumer issues from our user community.

Technology and Infrastructure 
 Zillow Group is a data- and technology-driven company. Our technical infrastructure, mobile applications and websites are built to provide consumers and real estate, rental and mortgage professionals with access to rich real estate data and powerful online tools to help them accomplish their home-related goals. Our success depends on our ability to innovate and enhance our products and services, adapt to changes in technology, and support new devices and operating systems. 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and are recorded in technology and development expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, expenses attributable to research and development for our business totaled $193.0 million, $170.1 million and $116.2 million, respectively. We expect to continue making significant investments in research and development as we explore new ways to deliver greater value to our consumer users and advertiser customers. For information about our research and development costs, see Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report. 
 Many of our services are available through real-time web-based application programming interfaces that allow our information to be easily integrated into third-party websites. We provide HTML and JavaScript-based widgets to allow easy integration of Zillow Group information onto other websites, with little custom programming. Our technology platform is built using industry-leading third-party and internally developed software as well as open source technologies. This combination allows for rapid development and release of high-performance software in a cost-effective and scalable manner. Our mobile applications and websites are designed to have high availability, from the internet connectivity providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems so that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage content delivery networks and use other third-party cloud computing services, including map-related and ad serving services, to ensure fast and local access to content. We employ a host of encryption, antivirus, firewall, monitoring, and patch-management technology to protect and maintain our systems. 
 Our Zillow technical infrastructure, mobile applications and websites are hosted at a third-party facility located in the Seattle area. We manage our Trulia mobile applications and website from a shared data center in Santa Clara, California. Additionally, we utilize third-party web services for cloud computing and storage to assist in service growth and redundancy.

We have 23 patents of varying lengths issued in the United States and internationally. These patents cover proprietary techniques that relate to determining a current value for a real estate property, performing summarization of geographic data points in response to zoom selection, the incorporation of individual aerial images and incorporating visual information into a master planar image, the collection, storage and display of home attribute values, providing for a multi-faceted search, and other proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services. Our Zestimate home valuation, for example, which we consider to be a significant competitive advantage with respect to consumer engagement, is currently protected by a patent. We have 51 patent applications pending in the United States and internationally, which seek to cover proprietary techniques relevant to our products and services. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective. 
 In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment provisions. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our mobile applications and websites. 
 Competition 
 We face competition to attract consumers to our mobile applications and websites and to attract advertisers to purchase our advertising products and services. 
 Competition for Consumers 
 We compete for the attention of consumers with companies that operate, or could develop, national and local real estate and rental listings search, as well as mortgage lender mobile applications and websites. We compete for consumers primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience, the utility of the data and services we provide, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information, and brand awareness and reputation. We believe we compete favorably on these factors. 
Competition for Advertisers 
 We compete for advertising customers, such as real estate professionals, with media companies, including companies dedicated to providing mobile and web-based real estate, rental and mortgage information and services to real estate professionals and consumers, local brokerage sites and major internet portals, general search engines and social media sites, as well as other online companies. We also compete for a share of advertisers overall marketing budgets with traditional media such as newspapers, television, magazines, and home/apartment guide publications, particularly with respect to advertising dollars spent at the local level by real estate agents, mortgage professionals, property managers or rental agents to advertise their qualifications or listings. We compete for advertising revenue based on perceived return on investment and perceived transaction readiness and overall quality of consumer leads, the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure and our ability to effectively deliver types of ads to targeted demographics. We believe we compete favorably on these factors. 
Government Regulation 
 We are affected by laws and regulations that apply to businesses in general, as well as to businesses operating on the internet and through mobile applications. This includes a continually expanding and evolving range of laws, regulations and standards that address information security, data protection, privacy, data collection and advertising, among other things. We are also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by telephone, email, mobile devices, and the internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act, and similar state laws. In addition, some of our mortgage advertising products are operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc., a licensed mortgage broker, pursuant to a support services agreement. Though we do not take mortgage 
 
17 
 
 applications or make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans, Zillow Group Mortgages, Inc. is subject to stringent state and federal laws and regulations and to the scrutiny of state and federal government agencies as a licensed mortgage broker. 
 By providing a medium through which users can post content and communicate with one another, we may also be subject to laws governing intellectual property ownership, obscenity, libel, and privacy, among other issues. In addition, the real estate agents, mortgage professionals, banks, property managers, rental agents and some of our other customers and advertisers on our mobile applications and websites are subject to various state and federal laws and regulations relating to real estate, rentals and mortgages. We endeavor to ensure that any content created by Zillow Group is consistent with such laws and regulations by obtaining assurances of compliance from our advertisers and consumers for their activities through, and the content they provide on, our mobile applications and websites. The real estate, mortgages, and rentals industries are subject to significant state and federal regulation; though we provide advertising services and technology solutions to real estate, mortgages, and rentals professionals, certain of our activities may be deemed to be covered by these industry regulations. Since the laws and regulations governing real estate, rentals and mortgages are constantly evolving and striving to keep pace with innovations in technology and media, it is possible that we may have to materially alter the way we conduct some parts of our business activities or be prohibited from conducting such activities altogether at some point in the future. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,181 full-time employees.
