Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 The terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” “Great Lakes” and “Company” refer to Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation and its subsidiaries.
 Organization
 Great Lakes is the largest provider of dredging services in the United States and is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. The Company was founded in 1890 as Lydon & Drews Partnership and performed its first project in Chicago, Illinois. The Company changed its name to Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company in 1905 and was involved in a number of marine construction and landfill projects along the Chicago lakefront and in the surrounding Great Lakes region. Great Lakes now provides dredging services in the East, West, and Gulf Coasts of the United States and worldwide. The Company also owns specialty contracting service providers which primarily offer environmental, remediation and geotechnical services throughout the United States.
 The Company operates in two operating segments: dredging and environmental & infrastructure which are also the Company’s reportable segments and reporting units. Financial information about the Company’s reportable segments and operating revenues by geographic region is provided in Note 10, Income Taxes and Note 18, Segment Information, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold assets associated with certain service lines of the environmental & infrastructure segment’s business, excluding assets supporting the remediation service line.
 Dredging Operations (84% of 2017 total revenues)
 Dredging generally involves the enhancement or preservation of navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Domestically, our work generally is performed in coastal waterways and deep water ports. The U.S. dredging market consists of four primary types of work: capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes. The Company’s “bid market” is defined as the aggregate dollar value of domestic dredging projects on which the Company bid or could have bid if not for capacity constraints or other considerations. The Company experienced an average combined bid market share in the U.S. of 42% over the prior three years, including 61%, 39%, 27% and 38% of the domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes sectors, respectively.
 Over its 127 year history, the Company has grown to be a leader in capital, coastal protection and maintenance dredging in the U.S. and is one of the oldest and most experienced dredging companies in the United States. In addition, the Company is the only U.S. dredging service provider with significant international operations. Over the prior three years, foreign dredging operations accounted for an average of 18% of the Company’s dredging revenues. The Company’s foreign projects are typically categorized in the capital work type, but are not included in the aforementioned bid market.
 Capital (domestic is 31% of 2017 dredging revenues). Capital dredging consists primarily of port expansion projects, which involve the deepening of channels and berthing basins to allow access by larger, deeper draft ships and the provision of land fill used to expand port facilities. In addition to port work, capital projects also include coastal restoration and land reclamations, trench digging for pipelines, tunnels and cables, and other dredging related to the construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures. Although capital work can be impacted by budgetary constraints and economic conditions, these projects typically generate an immediate economic benefit to the ports and surrounding communities.
 Foreign (7% of 2017 dredging revenues). Foreign capital projects typically involve land reclamations, channel deepening and port infrastructure development. The Company targets foreign opportunities that are well suited to the Company’s equipment and where it faces reduced competition from its European competitors. Maintaining a presence in foreign markets has enabled the Company to diversify its customer base and take advantage of differences in global economic development. Over the last ten years, the Company has performed dredging work in the Middle East, Africa, Australia, the Caribbean and Central and South America.
 Coastal protection (32% of 2017 dredging revenues). Coastal protection projects generally involve moving sand from the ocean floor to shoreline locations where erosion threatens shoreline assets. Beach erosion is a continuous problem that has intensified with the rise in coastal development and has become an important issue for state and local governments concerned with protecting beachfront tourism and real estate. Coastal protection via beach nourishment is often viewed as a better response to erosion than trapping sand through the use of sea walls and jetties, or relocating buildings and other assets away from the shoreline. Generally,

coastal protection projects take place during the fall and winter months to minimize interference with bird and marine life migration and breeding patterns as well as coastal recreation activities.
 Maintenance (23% of 2017 dredging revenues). Maintenance dredging consists of the re-dredging of previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments. Due to natural sedimentation, many channels require maintenance dredging every one to three years, thus creating a recurring source of dredging work that is typically non-deferrable if adequate commercial navigability is to be maintained. In addition, severe weather such as hurricanes, flooding and droughts can also cause the accumulation of sediments and drive the need for maintenance dredging.
 Rivers & lakes (7% of 2017 dredging revenues). Domestic rivers and lakes dredging and related operations typically consist of lake and river dredging, inland levee and construction dredging, environmental restoration and habitat improvement and other marine construction projects. Although the Mississippi River has a large source of projects on which the Company bids, certain dredges used on these projects are more portable and able to be transported to take advantage of the fragmented market. In addition, many of our dredges can be transported to sites of waterway environmental remediation work to assist our environmental & infrastructure segment on projects. Generally, inland river and lake projects in the northern U.S. take place in non-winter months because frozen waterways significantly reduce contractors’ ability to operate and transport its equipment in the relevant geographies.
 Dredging Demand Drivers
 The Company believes that the following factors are important drivers of the demand for its dredging services:
  
• | Deep port capital projects. Most of the East Coast and Gulf ports have expansion plans that include deepening and widening in order to better compete for international trade. International trade, particularly in the intermodal container shipping business, is undergoing significant change as a result of the Panama Canal expansion, which was completed in 2016. Many shipping lines have announced plans to deploy larger ships which, due to the channel dimension requirements, currently would not be able to use many U.S. ports. Miami’s port deepening project was completed in 2015 and its port channels are now able to accommodate larger vessels. Dredging began on the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project in 2015 and is expected to continue through 2018. The initial stages of mobilization began on the Charleston entrance channel projects during 2017. Dredging is expected to commence in 2018 and continue through 2020. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are resuming expansion efforts to remain competitive with deepened East Coast ports. In addition, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (“WRRDA”) signed in the second quarter of 2014, authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) to begin dredging to deepen the Savannah River channel, noted above, as well as initiate studies to deepen the ports in the Gulf Coast. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the House and the Senate passed the water resources development bill, rebranded as the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (“WIIN”), which includes the Water Resources Development Act of 2016. The Company views the bill as a positive catalyst for the domestic dredging industry as it authorizes nearly $16 billion in critical infrastructure improvements that are needed throughout the U.S. Further, the bill authorizes studies for future water resources improvements and makes modifications to previous authorizations. The Company is encouraged by the current administration's focus on repairing and rebuilding America's infrastructure, including our nation's ports and waterways. The Company believes that port deepening and expansion work authorized under current and anticipated future legislation will continue to provide significant opportunities for the domestic dredging industry.

• | Gulf coast restoration. There has been continued focus on restoring the barrier islands and wetlands that provide natural protection from storms in the Gulf Coast area. Many restoration projects have commenced to repair coastal areas. Several additional projects are being planned by state and local governments to restore natural barriers. The State of Louisiana has completed a master plan calling for a $50 billion investment in its coastal infrastructure, with a significant portion involving dredging. Additionally, during October 2015, BP plc settled the final Deepwater Horizon oil spill claims for approximately $20 billion. This amount reflects the preliminary agreement which was reached in the second quarter of 2015 and includes $5.5 billion related to Clean Water Act penalties. Several state and local governments have already reached agreements that resolve their claims in the disaster. Many of the Gulf States previously committed to spending a portion of the fines received to repair the natural resources impacted by the oil spill including on coastal restoration projects that include dredging. Although the bulk of the fines are to be paid over the next decade, the Company expects several coastal restoration projects envisioned by the Gulf States to come to fruition in the next couple of years providing a new source of domestic capital dredging projects on which the Company will bid. The annual bid market for domestic capital dredging, which includes deep port capital dredging and Gulf Coast restoration, averaged $369 million over the prior three years. During 2017, the Company was awarded an $88 million coastal restoration project in the Gulf of Mexico. This project commenced dredging in 2017 and is expected to be completed in 2018.

• | Substantial need for coastal protection. Beach erosion is a recurring problem due to the normal ebb and flow of coastlines as well as the effects of severe storm activity. Growing populations in coastal communities and vital beach tourism are drawing attention to the importance of protecting beachfront assets. Over the past few years, both the federal government
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and state and local entities have funded beach work recognizing the essential role these natural barriers play in absorbing storm energy and protecting public and private property. Superstorm Sandy highlighted the need for projects that clear the navigation channels, renourish damaged beaches and mitigate shore erosion from future storms. Since the beginning of 2013, the Corps has let for bid over $1 billion in projects to repair shorelines in New York and New Jersey damaged as a result of Superstorm Sandy. During February 2018, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations announced the supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and recovery which includes $17.4 billion for the Corps to fund projects that will reduce the risk of future damage from flood and storm events. Although it is uncertain the impact that this will have on the dredging market, the Company believes it is a positive indicator for work in the coastal protection and restoration markets. The annual bid market for coastal protection over the prior three years averaged $429 million.

• | Required maintenance of U.S. ports. The channels and waterways leading to U.S. ports have stated depths on which shippers rely when entering those ports. Due to naturally occurring sedimentation and severe weather, active channels require maintenance dredging to ensure that stated depths are at authorized levels. Consequently, the need to maintain channel depth creates a recurring source of dredging work that is non-deferrable if optimal navigability is to be preserved. The Corps is responsible for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control of U.S. waterways. The maritime industry, including the ports, has repeatedly advocated for congressional efforts to ensure that a fully funded, recurring maintenance program is in place. WIIN, previously mentioned, emphasizes previous WRRDA language which calls for full use of Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (“HMTF”) for its intended purpose of maintaining future access to the waterways and ports that support our nation’s economy. Further, WIIN ensures that Harbor Maintenance Tax (“HMT”) funding targets will increase by 3 percent over the prior year, even if the HMT revenue estimates decrease, to continue annual progress towards full use of the HMT by 2025. Through the increased appropriation of HMTF monies, the Company anticipates an increase in harbor projects to be let for bid throughout 2018 and beyond. The annual bid market for maintenance dredging over the prior three years averaged $355 million.

• | Need to maintain safe navigability of the U.S. river system. There are over twelve thousand miles of commercially navigable inland waterways that move more than 566 million tons of commercial goods annually. Transportation by barge requires less energy, and therefore is both better for the environment and costs less to move cargo than transportation by airplane, railcar or truck. Many industries rely on safe navigability of U.S. inland waterways as a primary means to transport goods and commodities such as coal, chemicals, petroleum, minerals, stones, metals and agricultural products. Natural sedimentation and other circumstances require that the inland waterway system be periodically dredged so that it can be used as intended. The Corps recognizes the need to maintain the safe navigability of U.S. waterways. The annual bid market for rivers and lakes dredging over the prior three years averaged $107 million.

• | Domestic and international energy transportation. The growth in demand for transportation of energy worldwide has driven the need for dredging to support new terminals, harbors, channels and pipelines. During 2014, Great Lakes completed dredging work on a project that will create a new shipping channel for a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) terminal being developed to export abundant energy resources from the west coast of Australia. The Company was awarded a contract with Corpus Christi Liquefaction, LLC (“CCL”) during 2015. CCL is developing an LNG export terminal at a site located on Corpus Christi Bay in Texas. Great Lakes' portion of the LNG project involves the dredging and slope protection of two LNG carrier ship berths, dredging of a material offloading and tug mooring basin, and expansion of an existing La Quinta Channel turning basin. The significant drop in crude oil prices in during recent years may lead to a slowdown in the development of LNG export plants; however, the Company continues to expect that future global energy demand will necessitate improvements in the infrastructure base around sources of rich resources and in countries that import global energy.

• | Middle East market. Over the past ten years, the Middle East has been a strong market for dredging services. With substantial income from oil revenues and significant real estate development, these countries have been undergoing extensive infrastructure expansion. Historically lower oil prices and the contraction in Middle East commercial and real estate development have slowed the rate of the region’s infrastructure development in recent years. Despite the decline in recent years, urban development continues to drive the need for land reclamation in the Middle East and the Company expects growth in the area over the next few years. During 2015, the Company completed the widening and deepening of a portion of the Suez Canal which expanded the seaborne cargo capacity of this important waterway.

 Environmental & Infrastructure Operations (approximately 16% of 2017 total revenues)
 The environmental & infrastructure segment provides construction services on soil, water and sediment for clients in both the public and private sectors in the United States. The segment’s services include environmental and geotechnical construction as well as soil, water and sediment environmental remediation for the state, local and private party markets. Environmental and geotechnical construction includes the creation, repair or stabilization of environmental barriers including slurry walls, in-situ stabilization, coal combustion residuals pond cap and close, dam and levee rehabilitation, deep soil mixing and other specialty civil construction. Remediation involves the containment, immobilization or removal of contamination from an environment through the use of any combination of isolation, treatment, or exhumation techniques including off-site disposal based on the quantity and severity of the 
 4

contamination. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company sold assets associated with certain service lines of the environmental & infrastructure segment’s business, excluding assets supporting the remediation service line. The environmental & infrastructure segment leverages the Company’s long term history of successfully executing projects on water and to offer turnkey environmental and infrastructure solutions in water and upland. 
 Environmental & Infrastructure Demand Drivers
 The Company believes that the following factors are important drivers of the demand for its environmental & infrastructure services:
  
• | Increasing requirements for environmental services. Both the dredging and environmental & infrastructure businesses have experienced requests for handling contaminated sediments, soils and other media at project sites. The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and several state agencies have begun to recognize the environmental hazards posed by stored industrial byproducts near waterways. The release of regulated pollutants into major waterways, inland lakes, groundwater and public and private lands requires the use of environmental remediation to remove the contaminated media.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Government mandated remediation. The EPA mandates remediation initiatives that are paid for partially or in whole by responsible parties. The capability to provide the environmental clean-up of not only the waterway, but also the processing of the contaminated sediment or any contaminated soil from other brownfield sites as well as services related to new federal regulations over the storage and disposal of coal ash provides a targeted growth opportunity for Great Lakes. The Company anticipates additional contracting opportunities arising from the transformation of the U.S. energy infrastructure, specifically related to the remediation requirements as mandated by the EPA’s rule to regulate the disposal of coal combustion residuals from electric utilities promulgated in June 2015.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Levee formation and repair. Levees play a crucial role in protecting against widespread flood damage; however many levees throughout the U.S. are currently deficient and in need of repair. Approximately 100,000 miles of levees exist in the U.S. and the average age is 54 years. The impacts of climate change, including increased storms and flooding, will drive the need for levee repair. During 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Company worked on levee projects in California. The Company will continue to work on levee projects throughout 2018. The Company believes that levee formation and repair will provide significant opportunities for the environmental & infrastructure segment over the next several years.

 For additional details regarding Dredging Operations and Environmental & Infrastructure Operations, including financial information regarding our international and U.S. revenues and long-lived assets, see Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Note 18, Segment Information, to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 Customers
 Dredging
 The dredging industry’s customers include federal, state and local governments, foreign governments and both domestic and foreign private concerns, such as utilities, oil and other energy companies. Most dredging projects are competitively bid, with the award going to the lowest qualified bidder. Customers generally have few economical alternatives to dredging services. The Corps is the largest dredging customer in the U.S. and has responsibility for federally funded projects related to navigation and flood control. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy are responsible for awarding federal contracts with respect to their own facilities. In 2017, approximately 63% of the Company’s dredging revenues were generated from 40 different contracts with federal agencies or third parties operating under contracts with federal agencies.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 Environmental & infrastructure customers include general contractors, corporations, Superfund potentially responsible parties, environmental engineering and construction firms that commission projects and federal as well as municipal government agencies. This segment benefits from key relationships with certain customers in the general contracting and environmental engineering industries. In 2017, two of the environmental & infrastructure segment’s customers were each responsible for approximately 12% of the environmental & infrastructure segment’s annual revenues; however, the loss of either or both of these customers would not have a material adverse effect on Great Lakes as a whole.

Bidding Process
 Dredging
 Most of the Company’s dredging contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid. The types of equipment required to perform the specified service, project site conditions, the estimated project duration, seasonality, location and complexity of a project affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that dredging contractors will bid.
 For contracts under its jurisdiction, the Corps typically prepares a fair and reasonable cost estimate based on the specifications of the project. To be successful, a bidder must be determined by the Corps to be a responsible bidder (i.e., a bidder that generally has the necessary equipment and experience to successfully complete the project as well as the ability to obtain a surety bid bond) and submit the lowest responsive bid that does not exceed 125% of the Corps’ original estimate. Contracts for state and local governments are generally awarded to the lowest qualified bidder. Contracts for private customers are awarded based on the contractor’s experience, equipment and schedule, as well as price. While substantially all of the Company’s dredging contracts are competitively bid, some government contracts are awarded through a sole source procurement process involving negotiation between the contractor and the government, while other projects are bid by the Corps through a “request for proposal” process. The request for proposal process benefits both Great Lakes and its customers as customers can award contracts based on factors beyond price, including experience, skill and specialized equipment.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 The majority of the environmental & infrastructure segment’s projects are secured through competitive bidding. When the environmental & infrastructure segment bids on a project, it evaluates the contract specifications and develops a cost estimate to which it adds an acceptable margin. While there are numerous competitors in the environmental & infrastructure services market, the Company benefits from its size, relationships and reputation. Therefore, there are occasions where the Company is not the lowest bidder on a contract, but is still awarded the project based on its reputation and qualifications.
 Bonding and Foreign Project Guarantees
 Dredging
 For most domestic projects and some foreign projects, dredging service providers are required to obtain three types of bonds: bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds. These bonds are typically provided by large insurance companies. A bid bond is required to serve as a guarantee so that if a service provider’s bid is chosen, the service provider will sign the contract. The amount of the bond is typically 20% of the service provider’s bid, with a range generally between $1 and $10 million. After a contract is signed, the bid bond is replaced by a performance bond, the purpose of which is to guarantee that the job will be completed. If the service provider fails to complete a job, the bonding company would be required to complete the job and would be entitled to be paid the contract price directly by the customer. Additionally, the bonding company would be entitled to be paid by the service provider for any costs incurred in excess of the contract price. A service provider’s ability to obtain performance bonds with respect to a particular contract depends upon the size of the contract, as well as the size of the service provider and its financial position. A payment bond is required to protect the service provider’s suppliers and subcontractors in the event that the service provider cannot make timely payments. Payment bonds are generally written at 100% of the contract value.
 The Company has bonding agreements with Argonaut Insurance Company, Berkley Insurance Company, Chubb Surety and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, (collectively, the “Sureties”) under which the Company can obtain performance, bid and payment bonds. The Company also has outstanding bonds with Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America and Zurich American Insurance Company (“Zurich”). Great Lakes has never experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding for any of its projects and Great Lakes has never failed to complete a marine project in its 127 year history. For most foreign dredging projects, letters of credit or bank guarantees issued by foreign banks are required as security for the bid, performance and, if applicable, advance payment guarantees. The Company obtains its letters of credit under the Credit Agreement (as defined below). Foreign bid guarantees are usually 2% to 5% of the service provider’s bid. Foreign performance and advance payment guarantees are each typically 5% to 10% of the contract value.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 The environmental & infrastructure segment contracts with both private, non-governmental customers and governmental entities and may be required to secure bonding for projects with both governmental entities and non-governmental customers. The Sureties also provide bonds for the environmental & infrastructure segment.

Competition
 Dredging
 The U.S. dredging industry is highly fragmented with approximately 250 entities in the U.S. presently operating more than 850 dredges, primarily in maintenance dredging. Most of these dredges are smaller and service the inland, as opposed to coastal, waterways, and therefore do not generally compete with Great Lakes except in our rivers & lakes market. Competition is determined by the size and complexity of the job; equipment bonding and certification requirements; and government regulations. Competition on rivers & lakes projects is determined primarily based on geographic reach, project execution capability and price. Great Lakes and three other companies comprised approximately 81% of the Company’s defined bid market related to domestic capital, coastal protection, maintenance and rivers & lakes over the prior three years. Within the Company’s bid market, competition is determined primarily on the basis of price. In addition, the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906, or “Dredging Act,” and Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or “Jones Act,” provide significant barriers to entry with respect to foreign competition. Together these two laws prohibit foreign-built, chartered or operated vessels from competing in the U.S. See “Business—Government Regulations” below.
 Competition in the international market is dominated by four large European dredging companies all of which operate larger equipment and fleets that are more extensive than the Company’s fleet. Recently, a large Chinese dredging company has emerged as a key player in the international market. In addition, there are several governmentally supported dredging companies that operate on a local or regional basis. The Company targets opportunities that are well suited to its equipment and where it can be most competitive. Most recently, the Company has focused on opportunities in the Middle East where the Company has cultivated close customer relationships and has pursued contracts compatible with the size of the Company’s vessels.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 The U.S. environmental & infrastructure and related services industry is highly fragmented and is comprised mostly of small regional companies. For larger projects, the Company will occasionally bid against larger engineering and construction firms. The environmental & infrastructure segment is able to perform both smaller and larger, more complex projects. The ability to deliver a wide range of interdisciplinary capabilities under a single project team is another competitive attribute.
 Equipment
 Dredging
 Great Lakes’ fleet of dredges, material barges and other specialized equipment is the largest and most diverse in the U.S. The Company operates three principal types of dredging equipment: hopper dredges, hydraulic dredges and mechanical dredges.
 Hopper Dredges. Hopper dredges are typically self-propelled and have the general appearance of an ocean-going vessel. The dredge has hollow hulls, or “hoppers,” into which material is suctioned hydraulically through drag-arms. Once the hoppers are filled, the dredge sails to the designated disposal site and either (i) bottom dumps the material or (ii) pumps the material from the hoppers through a pipeline to a designated site. Hopper dredges can operate in rough waters, are less likely than other types of dredges to interfere with ship traffic, and can be relocated quickly from one project to another. Hopper dredges primarily work on coastal protection and maintenance projects. The Company completed construction of a dual mode articulated tug/barge trailing suction hopper dredge (“ATB”), which is the largest domestic hopper dredge, during the fourth quarter of 2017.
 Hydraulic Dredges. Hydraulic dredges remove material using a revolving cutterhead which cuts and churns the sediment on the channel or ocean floor and hydraulically pumps the material by pipe to the disposal location. These dredges are very powerful and can dredge some types of rock. Certain dredged materials can be directly pumped for miles with the aid of multiple booster pumps. Hydraulic dredges work with an assortment of support equipment, which help with the positioning and movement of the dredge, handling of the pipelines and the placement of the dredged material. Unlike hopper dredges, relocating hydraulic dredges and all their ancillary equipment requires specialized vessels and additional time, and their operations can be impacted by ship traffic and rough waters. There is a wide range of hydraulic dredges from our smaller rivers & lakes vessels that use pipe sizes ranging from 10” to 22” and operate at between 365 and 3,200 total horsepower, while the Company’s other hydraulic dredges use pipe sizes ranging from 18” to 36” and operate at between 1,900 and 16,650 total horsepower.
 Mechanical Dredges. There are two basic types of mechanical dredges: clamshell and backhoe. In both types, the dredge uses a bucket to excavate material from the channel or ocean floor. The dredged material is placed by the bucket into material barges, or “scows,” for transport to the designated disposal area. The scows are emptied by bottom-dumping, direct pump-out or removal by a crane with a bucket. Mechanical dredges are capable of removing hard-packed sediments, blasted rock and debris and can work in tight areas such as along docks or terminals. Clamshell dredges with specialized buckets are ideally suited to handle material requiring environmentally controlled disposal. Additionally, the Company owns an electric clamshell dredge which provides an advantage in those markets with stringent emissions standards.
 7

Scows. The Company has the largest fleet of material barges in the domestic industry, which provides cost advantages when dredged material is required to be disposed far offshore or when material requires controlled disposal.  The Company uses scows with its hydraulic dredges and mechanical dredges.  Scows are an efficient and cost effective way to move material and increase dredging production. The Company has twelve scows in its fleet with a capacity ranging from 5,000 to 8,800 cubic yards.  
 In addition, the Company has numerous pieces of smaller equipment that support its dredging operations. Great Lakes’ domestic dredging fleet is typically positioned on the East and Gulf Coasts, with a smaller number of vessels occasionally positioned on the West Coast, and with many of the rivers & lakes dredges on inland rivers and lakes. The mobility of the fleet enables the Company to move equipment in response to changes in demand. Great Lakes’ fleet also includes vessels currently positioned in the Middle East.
 The Company continually assesses its need to upgrade and expand its dredging fleet to take advantage of improving technology and to address the changing needs of the dredging market. The Company is also committed to preventive maintenance, which it believes is reflected in the long lives of most if its equipment and its low level of unscheduled downtime on jobs. To the extent that market conditions warrant the expenditures, Great Lakes can prolong the useful life of its vessels. 
 During 2017, management initiated a strategic review to improve the Company's financial results in both domestic and international operations. As a result of this review, management began execution of a plan to retire certain underperforming and underutilized assets. The retirement of these underperforming and underutilized assets is expected to be completed in 2018.
 Certification of equipment by the U.S. Coast Guard and establishment of the permissible loading capacity by the American Bureau of Shipping (“A.B.S.”) are important factors in the Company’s dredging business. Many projects, such as coastal protection projects with offshore sand borrow sites and dredging projects in exposed entrance channels or with offshore disposal areas, are restricted by federal regulations to be performed only by dredges or scows that have U.S. Coast Guard certification and a load line established by A.B.S. The certifications indicate that the dredge is structurally capable of operating in open waters. The Company has more certified dredging vessels than any of the Company’s domestic competitors and makes substantial investments to maintain these certifications.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 The environmental & infrastructure segment owns and operates a wide range of specialty equipment commonly used for geotechnical slurry wall construction including long-stick excavators, slurry batch plants, de-sanders, and jet shear mixers as well as a number of mixing augers utilized for in-situ stabilization.  The group also owns and operates specialized remediation equipment, including a fleet of tracked excavators, haul trucks, dozers, and other earth moving equipment commonly used for remediation earthwork.  Specialty demolition attachments used to support facility remediation includes a limited number of shears, pulverizers, processors, grapples and hydraulic hammers that facilitate processing of construction and demolition debris for recycling, reclamation and disposal. The Company rents additional equipment on a project-by-project basis, which allows the Company flexibility to adjust costs to the level of project activity.
 Seasonality
 Seasonality generally does not have a significant impact on the Company’s dredging operations. However, many East Coast coastal protection projects are limited by environmental windows that require work to be performed in winter months to protect wildlife habitats. The Company can mitigate the impact of these environmental restrictions to a certain extent because the Company has the flexibility to reposition its equipment to project sites, if available, that are not limited by these restrictions. In addition, rivers and lakes in the northern U.S. freeze during the winter, significantly reducing the Company’s ability to operate and transport its equipment in the relevant geographies. Fish spawning and flooding can affect dredging operations as well. 
 The Company’s environmental & infrastructure segment operates across a national footprint. Similar to the dredging segment, the environmental & infrastructure segment’s projects are impacted by the freezing rivers and lakes in the northern climates during the winter and by the rainy season on the rivers and levees along the West Coast.  The Company’s broad spectrum capability and geographical footprint should increasingly allow it to pursue and execute work in the warmer southern climates, eventually diminishing the effects of weather related seasonality.
 Weather
 The Company’s ability to perform its contracts may depend on weather conditions. Inclement or hazardous weather conditions can delay the completion of a project, can result in disruption or early termination of a project, unanticipated recovery costs or liability exposure and additional costs. As part of bidding on fixed price contracts, the Company makes allowances, consistent with historical weather data, for project downtime due to adverse weather conditions. In the event that the Company experiences adverse weather beyond these allowances, a project may require additional days to complete, resulting in additional costs and decreased gross profit

margins. Conversely, favorable weather can accelerate the completion of the project, resulting in cost savings and increased gross profit margins. Typically, Great Lakes is exposed to significant weather in the first and fourth quarters, and certain projects are required to be performed in environmental windows that occur during these periods. See “Business-Seasonality” above.
 Weather is difficult to predict and historical records exist for only the last 100-125 years. Changes in weather patterns may cause a deviation from project weather allowances on a more frequent basis and consequently increase or decrease gross profit margin, as applicable, on a project-by-project basis. In a typical year, the Company works on many projects in multiple geographic locations and experiences both positive and negative deviations from project weather allowances. Accordingly, it is unlikely that future climate change will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
 Backlog
 The Company’s contract backlog represents its estimate of the revenues that will be realized under the portion of the contracts remaining to be performed. For dredging contracts these estimates are based primarily upon the time and costs required to mobilize the necessary assets to and from the project site, the amount and type of material to be dredged and the expected production capabilities of the equipment performing the work. For environmental & infrastructure contracts, these estimates are based on the time and remaining costs required to complete the project, relative to total estimated project costs and project revenues agreed to with the applicable customer. However, these estimates are necessarily subject to variances based upon actual circumstances. Because of these factors, as well as factors affecting the time required to complete each job, backlog is not always indicative of future revenues or profitability. In addition, a significant amount of the Company’s dredging backlog relates to federal government contracts, which can be canceled at any time without penalty, subject to the Company’s right, in some cases, to recover the Company’s actual committed costs and profit on work performed up to the date of cancellation. The Company’s backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based upon the type and size of the projects the Company is awarded from the bid market. A quarterly increase or decrease of the Company’s backlog does not necessarily result in an improvement or a deterioration of the Company’s business. The Company’s backlog includes only those projects for which the Company has obtained a signed contract with the customer. The components of the Company’s backlog including dollar amount and other related information are addressed in more detail in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Bidding Activity and Backlog.”
Employees
 Dredging
 At December 31, 2017, the Company employed 380 full-time salaried personnel in the U.S., including those in a corporate function. In addition, the Company employs U.S. hourly personnel, most of whom are unionized, on a project-by-project basis. Crews are generally available for hire on relatively short notice. During 2017, the Company employed an average of approximately 650 hourly personnel to meet domestic project requirements.
 At December 31, 2017, the Company employed 10 expatriates, 37 foreign nationals and 50 local staff to manage and administer its Middle East operations. During 2017, the Company also employed a daily average of 104 hourly personnel to meet project requirements in the Middle East.
 Environmental & infrastructure
 At December 31, 2017, the environmental & infrastructure segment employed 95 full-time salaried administrative employees, in addition to an average of approximately 100 hourly employees, some of whom are unionized. The hourly employees are hired on a project-by-project basis and are generally available for hire on relatively short notice.
 Safety
 Safety of its employees is one of the Company’s core values. The Company employs behavioral and system based programs, with both the dredging and the environmental & infrastructure segments utilizing an Incident & Injury Free® (IIF) approach. The Company’s safety culture is committed to training, behavioral based awareness and mutual responsibility for the wellbeing of its employees. The Company’s goal is sustainable safety excellence. Incident prevention in all areas have top priority in the Company’s business planning, in the overall conduct of its business, and in the operation and maintenance of our equipment (marine and land) and facilities.
Unions
 The Company is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. that govern its relationships with its unionized hourly workforce. However, two unions represent a large majority of our dredging employees - the International Union of 
 9

Operating Engineers (“IUOE”), Local 25 and the Seafarers International Union. The Company’s contracts with IUOE, Local 25 expire in September 2018. Our agreements with Seafarers International Union expire in February 2023. The Company has not experienced any major labor disputes in the past five years and believes it has good relationships with the unions that represent a significant number of its hourly employees; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will not experience labor strikes or disturbances in the future.
 Government Regulations
 The Company is subject to government regulations pursuant to the Dredging Act, the Jones Act, the Shipping Act, 1916, or “Shipping Act,” and the vessel documentation laws set forth in Chapter 121 of Title 46 of the United States Code. These statutes require vessels engaged in dredging in the navigable waters of the United States to be documented with a coastwise endorsement, to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, to be manned by U.S. crews, and to be built in the United States. The U.S. citizen ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S. citizen owned and prohibit the chartering of the vessel to any entity that does not meet the 75% U.S. citizen ownership test.
Environmental Matters
 The Company’s operations, facilities and vessels are subject to various environmental laws and regulations related to, among other things: dredging operations; the disposal of dredged material; protection of wetlands; storm water and waste water discharges; demolition activities; asbestos removal; transportation and disposal of wastes and materials; air emissions; and remediation of contaminated soil, sediments, surface water and groundwater. The Company is also subject to laws designed to protect certain marine species and habitats. Compliance with these statutes and regulations can delay appropriation and/or performance of particular projects and increase related project costs. Non-compliance can also result in fines, penalties and claims by third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury, as well as damages to property and natural resources.
 Certain environmental laws such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 impose strict and, under some circumstances joint and several, liability on owners and operators of facilities and vessels for investigation and remediation of releases and discharges of regulated materials, and also impose liability for related damages to natural resources. The Company’s past and ongoing operations involve the use, and from time to time the release or discharge, of regulated materials which could result in liability under these and other environmental laws. The Company has remediated known releases and discharges as deemed necessary, but there can be no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred if, for example, third party claims arise or new conditions are discovered.
 The Company’s projects may involve remediation, demolition, excavation, transportation, management and disposal of hazardous waste and other regulated materials. Various laws strictly regulate the removal, treatment and transportation of hazardous water and other regulated materials and impose liability for human health effects and environmental contamination caused by these materials. The Company takes steps to limit its potential liability by hiring qualified subcontractors from time to time to remove such materials from our projects, and some project contracts require the client to retain liability for hazardous waste generation.
 Based on the Company’s experience and available information, the Company believes that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (and liability for known environmental conditions) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the Company cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or to respond to newly discovered conditions, such as future cleanup matters or other environmental claims.
