Item 1 – Business
Corporate Structure
 
We were incorporated as Cetrone Energy Company on January 28, 2008 in the State of Nevada. From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of FSP, the principal business of the Company originally was to develop “green” renewable fuel sources for agricultural operations, specifically biodiesel. On July 26, 2010, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Fresh Start Private Management, Inc. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. As a result of the reverse acquisition of FSP, on October 31, 2011, we ceased our prior operations and we are now a holding company and our wholly owned subsidiary engages in alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment through our BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program and related products.
 
On October 31, 2011, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with FSP whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of FSP in exchange for 37,000,000 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 31.3% of our total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, FSP became our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 
The share exchange transaction with FSP was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FSP as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of FSP. 
 
On January 7, 2014, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to BioCorRxÒ Inc.
 
Effective July 5, 2016, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock of the Company from two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of common stock, and eighty thousand (80,000) shares of preferred stock, both $.001 par value respectively, to five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares common stock ($0.001 par value), and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock (no par value), respectively.
 
 On July 28, 2016, we formed BioCorRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, for the purpose of developing certain business lines. In connection with the formation, the, the newly formed sub issued 24.2% ownership to officers of the Company with the Company retaining 75.8%. 
 
On November 23, 2016, the Company” filed a certificate of designations, rights and preferences with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada pursuant to which the Company set forth the designation, powers, rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions of the Series B Preferred Stock. 
 
On January 16, 2018, majority stockholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to amend its articles of incorporation to increase the authorized shares of capital stock (the “Share Increase”) of the Company from five hundred twenty five million (525,000,000) shares of common stock, $.001 par value per share, and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share, to seven hundred fifty million (750,000,000) shares of common stock ($0.001 par value per share) and six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of preferred stock ($0.001 par value per share). The Share Increase has not yet taken effect, but is expected to take effect in the near future.
 
Also, on January 16, 2018, majority stockholders holding 59% of the voting equity voted to grant discretionary authority to the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), at any time or times for a period of 12 months after the date of the Written Consent, to Adopt an amendment to our Articles to effect a Reverse Split of our issued and outstanding common stock in a range of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-500 (the “Reverse Split”). The Reverse Split has not yet taken effect, the Board has not yet determined the ratio of the Reverse Split, nor is the Board obligated to effect the Reverse Split.

Business Overview
 
We have developed and own the rights to an innovative alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program, called BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program that empowers patients to succeed in their overall recovery. We offer a comprehensive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program that combines non-addictive medication coupled with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules and peer recovery support and tracking. We have been operating for over 6 years and over 1,000 patients have been treated with our program since we began operating. The addiction treatment services reported cost from provider to patient is an average of $12,500 per patient and a portion is sometimes covered by insurance according to treatment providers. This amount varies due to many factors, the major ones being, type of insurance policy and patients out of network deductibles. In addition, there are the service provider expenses, and surgery center costs (if not done in the medical provider’s office). Services may also be provided to cash patients, by licensed providers, at discounted rates due to financial difficulties.
 
The BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program is a comprehensive addiction program which includes peer support coaching and counseling modules (typically completed in16 sessions on average but not limited to), coupled with a naltrexone implant. The implant is specifically compounded with a prescription from a medical doctor for each individual and is designed to release naltrexone into the body over multiple months. The naltrexone implant means a single administration, long acting naltrexone pellet(s) that consists of a naltrexone formulation in a biodegradable form that is suitable for subcutaneous implantation in a particular patient.
 
Treatment Philosophy
 
Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program empowers patients to succeed. A detailed description of our treatment philosophy is as follows:
 
Medical Intervention: It is essential to significantly reduce a patient’s cravings for alcohol and opioids in order to fully break the cycle of addiction. We have built our BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program around a state-of-the-art, minimally invasive, biodegradable implant of naltrexone. Naltrexone is an FDA-approved pharmaceutical used for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction. A licensed physician surgically inserts a marble-sized pellet(s) under the skin in the lower abdomen. The pellet is absorbed into the body and typically dissolves within months following the procedure in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors.
Focus on Treatment: Unlike many other addiction treatment programs, we focus primarily on the treatment of alcohol and opioid addiction. 
 
Comprehensive Approach: Alcoholism and opioid addiction are complex diseases that needs a program specifically designed to treat the body, the mind, and the spirit of one suffering from addiction. We have created a comprehensive recovery program that includes state-of-the-art medical intervention, individually tailored peer support and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) counseling modules used by trained addiction specialists. Our program typically lasts for up to 13 months from the initial surgical procedure of inserting the naltrexone pellet(s) to the last peer support coaching session. We believe that through our comprehensive treatment method, clients will have the highest possible chances of full recovery from alcohol and opioid dependency.
Program Description
 
We offer a comprehensive and highly effective alcohol and opioid addiction treatment program. Our proprietary program is designed to offer treatment and healing to both the body and the mind of those suffering from addiction. Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program is a two-part program that includes: (i) the insertion of a naltrexone implant that is believed to reduce physical cravings of alcohol and opioids by a trained physician; and (ii) peer support and CBT that focuses on the psycho-social aspect of addiction. The following is a detailed description of our treatment program.
Naltrexone Implant: Our unique program has reduced physical cravings for numerous patients suffering from alcoholism and opioid addiction. Our implant is believed to reduce cravings over the period of multiple months in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors. During this time, the program focuses on addressing the mental dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. The implant is a naltrexone pellet(s) that is the size of a marble and inserted via an outpatient surgical procedure into the lower abdomen of the patient. The naltrexone pellets will be absorbed by the body over time and will automatically dissolve and not need to be removed unless otherwise required.

All procedures to place the naltrexone pellets into patients are performed at several independently owned and licensed provider locations. There are over 30 licensed providers throughout the United States that offer the BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program. Addresses of most independently owned provider locations offering our program are available on our website www.beataddiction.com. The procedures are performed by a licensed medical physician.
 
The naltrexone implant is produced by select compounding pharmacies contracted by Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. We entered into an exclusive license dated September 7, 2010 (the “License Agreement”) with Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Trinity Rx Solutions, LLC) (“Trinity”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the License Agreement, Trinity shall provide to our partners access to the naltrexone implant that has been designed for addiction treatment. As consideration for the License Agreement, the Company has issued 5,672,250 shares of our common stock (which was equal to 7.5% of the total shares outstanding at the time of the execution of the agreement). 
 
A copy of the License Agreement with Trinity is incorporated herein by reference and was filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2011. The description of the transaction contemplated by such License Agreement set forth herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the exhibit filed therewith and incorporated herein by reference. 
 
The naltrexone implant is one or two small pellets that are inserted beneath the skin in the subcutaneous fat located in the lower abdomen. The implant procedure is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 20-30 minutes. A local anesthetic is administered before the pellets are implanted and the patient is free to leave the clinic and return to normal activities within a few hours of the procedure in most cases. The pellets are biodegradable and will gradually dissolve in the human body. The pellets contain a medicine called naltrexone, which has been shown to block receptors in the brain that crave alcohol and opioids. naltrexone is an FDA approved medication and all patients are required to obtain a prescription for the medication from a medical doctor. The doctors employed by the licensed providers are responsible for evaluating the patients, determining if the patient is a candidate and, if so, writing the prescription. The prescription is then presented to compounding pharmacies contracted by Trinity that produce the pellets using naltrexone as the core ingredient. BioCorRx does not compound, manufacture or handle the naltrexone implants.
 
Once the pellet is implanted in the patient, they are usually free to return to work on the next business day and will be contacted by a peer support specialist and/or counselor within a few days if not prior to the procedure to begin the behavioral portion of the program.
 
BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program CBT: We developed a CBT program to assist patients in addressing their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. Prior to, or upon receiving the naltrexone implant, each patient will typically speak with a counselor/therapist. This counselor/therapist will treat the patient for the next several weeks following the implant using the program modules in combination with their own skill sets to help them cope with and address their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. It usually takes approximately 16 sessions to complete the program modules.
 
As part of the peer support and CBT program, peer support specialists/counselors focus on bringing family and friends into the recovery process. This provides emotional support for patients and allows them to understand that they have people that care for them and want them to remain sober. The peer support portion of the program typically lasts for 12 months.

Marketing Strategy
 
We have and will continue to use a variety of advertising and marketing channels to increase our exposure and awareness to prospective patients about our BioCorRxÒ Recovery Program. In addition to word of mouth from patients, we are focusing advertising and public relations on the radio, television and digital.
Competition
 
We offer a unique, proprietary treatment plan for alcoholism and opioid addiction. However, there are many services and clinics that already provide support for addiction. There are rehabilitation and treatment centers within close proximity to our licensed providers that provide alcohol and opioid addiction treatment and detoxification services, some using other naltrexone implants. We hope to distinguish ourselves from our competition by proving that our program is successful and our success rate is much higher than our competitors. We intend to continue our expansion of the number of licensed providers throughout the United States using our program on their patients.
Growth Strategy
 
We have developed a program that we believe helps patients battle their mental and physical addiction to alcohol and opioids more effectively than traditional methods. We are currently operating in Anaheim, California and market nationally. We are constantly seeking and contracting withadditional independent treatment providers in the United States and ramping up efforts to establish pilot programs with local and state government entities.
Government Regulation and Approvals
 
All Surgical procedures need to be performed by a licensed physician.
 
The naltrexone implant does not require regulatory approval because naltrexone is already an FDA approved medication. Once the physician writes a prescription for naltrexone implant, a pharmacist can put it into a compounded form under U.S. Compounding laws and then distribute the compounded medication directly to the ordering physician treating the intended patient. The pharmacy is required to be properly licensed in each state to which the implant is being distributed.
Intellectual Property/Licensing Rights
 
On June 30, 2015, we acquired the complete rights, title and interest in the Naltrexone Implant Formulation used specifically in the BioCorRx Recovery Program for an aggregate purchase price of $1,132,000 comprised of an obligation to pay $1,000,000 over 14 months starting October 1, 2015 and 3,000,000 of the Company’s common stock at the market value of $0.044 per share as of the date of the agreement.
