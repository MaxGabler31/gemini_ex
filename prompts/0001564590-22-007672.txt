Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing antiviral therapeutics to improve the lives of patients suffering from difficult to treat, life-threatening viral infections. Our current focus is on the development of product candidates to treat COVID-19, hepatitis C virus (“HCV”), dengue and respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”). 
 Utilizing our team’s expertise and experience from decades of developing innovative antiviral treatments, we are advancing product candidates that are designed to be potent and selective, including nucleos(t)ide analogs developed as either monotherapy or in combination with other antiviral agents.  Each of the nucleos(t)ide analogs we are developing, specifically bemnifosbuvir (AT-527) and AT-752, have been derived from our proprietary nucleotide platform that combines unique nucleotide scaffolds with novel double prodrugs for the purpose of inhibiting the enzymes central to viral replication. We believe that utilizing this double prodrug moiety approach allows us to maximize formation of the active metabolite, potentially resulting in oral antiviral product candidates that are selective for and highly effective at preventing replication of single stranded RNA (“ssRNA”) viruses while avoiding toxicity to host cells.  We have built, and we plan to continue to build our pipeline of antiviral product candidates by augmenting our nucleos(t)ide platform with other classes of antivirals we believe that may be developed in combination with our nucleos(t)ide product candidates.
 The Nucleos(t)ide Class and Combination Treatments 
 Combination therapy utilizing multiple direct acting antivirals with differing mechanisms of action is an established strategy that has been historically successful in treating many life-threatening viral diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”), hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) and HCV.  Nucleos(t)ide analogs are the backbone of many of these successful combination therapies. 
 Drug combinations can simultaneously target multiple points in the viral replication cycle and can also combat resistance that may develop over time with use of single agent drugs.  Because nucleos(t)ide analogs target highly conserved enzymes responsible for viral replication, these agents have a high barrier to resistance compared to drugs in other antiviral classes.  We believe this profile makes nucleos(t)ide analogs well suited for use in combination regimens for the treatment of viral diseases, potentially allowing us to leverage our nucleos(t)ide platform and the differentiated product candidates derived from it as the backbone of potential combination therapy.  
 Our Development Pipeline
 The following table summarizes our orally administered antiviral product candidate pipeline.  All our product candidates, with the exception of ruzasvir which we in-licensed from MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck & Co, Inc.  (“Merck”) in December 2021, have been discovered and developed internally at Atea.  We have full global rights to commercialize all our product candidates in all indications.

 COVID-19  
 The global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which was first reported in Wuhan, China on December 1, 2019, has created significant disruption to public health and economic activity worldwide.  As of February 21, 2022, there has been reported over 420 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, nearly six million deaths worldwide and lasting health problems, frequently referred to as “Long COVID” in many survivors. 
 At approximately two years into the pandemic, unprecedented progress has been made with both vaccines and treatment options.  Treatment options in the United States, that have either been approved or authorized for emergency use for high-risk patients, include the oral direct acting antivirals Paxlovid™ (nirmatrevir and ritonavir) and molnupiravir, each of which have demonstrated the important impact that easily administered agents can have on preventing disease progression, hospitalization and death.  Treatment options also include Veklury® (remdesivir), a direct acting antiviral which is administered through IV infusion, in addition to monoclonal antibodies which are also administered through IV infusion.  This progress has, however, been offset by a blend of vaccine hesitancy, vaccine resistance and the emergence of a number of SARS-COV-2 variants, most recently omicron, that have increased transmissibility and the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies.  
 As a result, substantial need remains for additional treatment options.  As COVID-19 becomes endemic with the potential for variant fueled pandemic surges, we believe that this need will continue for years.  
 As single agent therapeutics become more widely utilized by larger, broader populations during the endemic phase, the potential for development of resistance increases, especially for those agents which do not target highly conserved sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  We believe that oral therapies which are practical, convenient and efficient for use in the early stages of disease, have the potential to protect against the development of severe infection and transmission of the virus, and to benefit a wide range of patient populations including patients who are unvaccinated, patients who fail to respond to available vaccines, individuals for whom a vaccine is contraindicated, and vaccinated patients with waning efficacy, which can occur between three to six months after immunization.

We believe that nucleoside analogues are promising candidates for combination therapy development since antiviral activity is expected to remain even in the presence of newly emerging variants. In particular, we believe bemnifosbuvir is a well-suited product candidate for development in COVID-19 combination regimens as it is designed to target not only the highly conserved polymerase, but also the nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyltranferase (“NiRAN”) function and it has been to be well tolerated in clinical trials completed to date.    
 As additional oral therapies are developed and are added to the treatment armamentarium, we believe that combination regimens will be needed to cover broad patient populations, as newer variants emerge, and resistance develops with the use of single agents.  
 Bemnifosbuvir
 Our most advanced product candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 is bemnifosbuvir, an investigational, novel, orally administered guanosine nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor which we believe could be a preferred backbone for an oral combination regimen.  Bemnifosbuvir has a unique dual mechanism of action at both the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and NiRAN active sites on the highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase.  As we anticipate continued rapid emergence and evolution of viral variants together with the potential for viral drug resistance to single agent therapies which could render previously effective monotherapy obsolete, we have prioritized the development of bemnifosbuvir as a potential combination therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. 
 In 2021, we reported data from two monotherapy Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of COVID-19.  One study was conducted in hospitalized adult high-risk patients with moderate COVID-19, while the second was conducted in adult outpatients with mild to moderate disease.  Although the Phase 2 clinical trial in adult outpatients did not meet its primary endpoint and the Phase 2 clinical trial in hospitalized patients was closed out prior to completion, there were consistent positive trends in antiviral activity (~0.5 log10 reductions) observed after dosing with 550 mg BID and 1100 mg BID in sub-groups of patients at high risk for progression.  In addition, results from a bronchoalveolar lavage study in healthy subjects showed that bemnifosbuvir was efficiently delivered to the lungs (epithelial lining fluid), the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  We believe the collective results from these studies provide positive human proof-of-concept to support our combination strategy.  
 To efficiently develop a combination regimen for the treatment of COVID-19, we plan to initially study the combination of bemnifosbuvir with a protease inhibitor.  As a class, protease inhibitors have demonstrated antiviral activity in COVID-19 but may be susceptible to resistance if used as a single agent.  We have initiated preclinical in vitro combination studies of bemnifosbuvir with protease inhibitors to explore antiviral synergy and mitigation of potential viral resistance.  Data from ongoing in vitro studies is expected in the first half of 2022. 
 Hepatitis C
 Despite significant recent advances in treatment, HCV remains a global health burden largely owing to the epidemic of injection drug use, and a lack of diagnosis of many of those who have been infected. 
 Bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir
 For the treatment of chronic HCV infection, we are advancing a novel combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, an investigational nonstructural protein 5A (“NS5A”) inhibitor that we exclusively in-licensed from Merck in December 2021.  As single agents, both bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir have demonstrated potent pan-genotypic antiviral activity against HCV.  As ruzasvir is a Phase 2-ready NS5A inhibitor that has already been evaluated by Merck in over 1200 HCV-infected patients, we have prioritized clinical development of the ruzasvir/bemnifosbuvir combination program over the AT-777/AT-787 programs (AT-777 being our prior lead NS5A inhibitor program which was paused at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic given industry-wide challenges in conducting clinical studies at that time).  
 We believe that a combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir has the potential to offer a differentiated short duration, pan-genotypic protease-sparing regimen for HCV-infected patients with or without cirrhosis. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a life-threatening stage of liver disease, we believe that the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir may have the potential to treat these patients without the co-administration of ribavirin.  In the second half of 2022, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial 
 3

of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir evaluating the safety and efficacy in HCV-infected patients.
 Dengue 
 Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that infects up to 400 million people worldwide a year, causing substantial public health and economic burden.  Dengue, which is life threatening in severe cases, was traditionally considered a tropical disease, endemic to countries located mostly in the tropical regions of Asia, Latin America, the Pacific, and across Africa. However, in recent decades the incidence of the disease has been spreading globally.  While a vaccine to prevent dengue is approved in some countries, it is indicated only for persons with confirmed prior dengue infection and its product label use is highly restricted. Currently there are no antiviral therapies approved by either the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or the European Commission.
 AT-752 
 To address this unmet medical need, we are developing AT-752, an oral, purine nucleotide prodrug for the treatment of dengue.  AT-752 targets and inhibits of the dengue viral polymerase and, in preclinical studies, the drug candidate showed potent in vitro activity against all dengue serotypes tested, as well as potent in vivo antiviral activity in small animal models. 
 In 2021, we initiated and completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (“PK”), of different dosages of AT-752 in healthy adults (n=65).  In this first-in-human clinical trial, AT-752 administered as single or multiple ascending doses was well tolerated.   No premature discontinuations due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported and most adverse events were mild.  There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters.  
 In 2022, we anticipate conducting two studies of AT-752.  One will be a human challenge study designed to allow assessment of viral load and viral kinetics in healthy subjects who are challenged with a Dengue Virus-1 Live Virus Human Challenge (DENV-1-LVHC) strain after receiving AT-752 or placebo.  This study will be conducted in the United States. We are also preparing to initiate a Phase 2, global randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with dengue fever.  This proof-of-concept study in patients is designed to evaluate the antiviral activity, safety and PK of multiple doses of AT-752.  It will be conducted in areas where dengue is endemic.
 RSV 
 RSV is a seasonal respiratory virus that is responsible for significant health and economic burden worldwide. RSV is a common virus that causes severe respiratory disease in infants, which often leads to hospitalization. Up to 70% of infants are infected by the age of one and virtually all infants will have been infected by their third year of life. As protective immunity wanes, RSV reinfection in children and adults, is common. While these reinfections tend to be milder, RSV is a well-established cause of significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly, the immunocompromised and other high-risk patients. There is also an increased awareness of the long-term consequences of RSV primary infection that have been linked to prolonged wheezing and an increased risk of developing asthma.  There are no approved vaccines.  The only approved drugs are ribavirin, which has safety concerns and questionable efficacy and Synagis, a monoclonal antibody which is indicated not for treatment but only for protection against RSV in a high risk pediatric population.
 Based on the extensive structure-activity relationship we have identified with our nucleos(t)ide library, we are optimizing the inhibitory potency and selectivity of lead analogs against RSV RdRp. In the second half of 2022, we anticipate nominating a lead candidate and initiating investigational new drug application (“IND”)-enabling studies. 
 Our Team
 Our management team has significant experience discovering, developing and commercializing antiviral therapies for life-threatening viral infections. Our Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Jean-Pierre Sommadossi, Ph.D., has over 30 years of scientific, operational, strategic, and management experience in the biopharmaceutical industry.  Dr. Sommadossi has authored over 180 peer-reviewed 
 4

publications and holds more than 135 U.S. patents related to antiviral and cancer therapeutics.  Dr. Sommadossi was the principal founder of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Idenix”), which was acquired by Merck in 2014, and a co-founder of Pharmasset, Inc. (“Pharmasset”), which was acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc. in 2012. 
 We have assembled an experienced management and scientific team with a track record of success in the field of antiviral drug development, many of whom have worked together previously. Our team has significant expertise in nucleos(t)ide chemistry, biochemistry and virology and has applied that expertise towards the discovery and development of innovative antiviral treatments, including Epivir, Sovaldi, Tyzeka, Valtrex, Wellferon, Videx, Reyataz, Sustiva, Mavyret, Xofluza, Relenza, Zerit, Zepatier, Epclusa, Harvoni and Veklury. Members of our team have held senior positions at AstraZeneca plc, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Chiron, Novartis International AG, Biogen, F. Hoffmann La Roche, Abbvie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Shire, Biohaven Pharma, Pharmasset, Idenix, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to become a global leader in the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel antiviral therapies for severe or life-threatening viral infections. We intend to achieve this goal by pursuing the following strategies:
 Deploy our medicinal chemistry expertise and proprietary nucleotide platform against severe ssRNA viruses with high unmet need. We are developing oral, small molecule antiviral product candidates for the treatment of severe viral diseases. These drug candidates are derived from our proprietary platform complemented by the strategic in license of drug candidates with mechanisms of action different from the drug candidates generated from our platform. Our pipeline includes three programs each at the Phase 2 development stage with drug candidates advancing for the treatment of COVID-19, hepatitis C and dengue fever as well as a preclinical program for RSV. We anticipate multiple value driving milestones over the next 18 months from our three clinical programs.
 Develop bemnifosbuvir (AT-527) as the nucleos(t)ide polymerase preferred backbone for combination therapy for the treatment of COVID-19. Bemnifosbuvir, is an investigational, orally administered, non-mutagenic, direct-acting antiviral agent that has been evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials.  In these Phase 2 trials, bemnifosbuvir has been generally well tolerated and antiviral activity of bemnifosbuvir was observed in high-risk patients with COVID-19.  In vitro, bemnifosbuvir has shown potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication against all major variants of concern or interest that have been evaluated.  Historically, the emergence of viral resistance has been a major obstacle to successful antiviral therapy. We believe bemnifosbuvir’s mechanism of action, which targets two sites within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and results in termination of RNA synthesis and inhibition of NiRAN activity, has the potential create a high barrier to viral resistance.  Taken together, we believe that these properties make bemnifosbuvir an ideal candidate for development as a backbone of potential combination regimens for the treatment of COVID-19.   
 Advance a potentially best-in-class pan-genotypic regimen of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for HCV. Despite the availability of DAA oral combination regimens for the treatment of HCV, there remains a large, underserved, HCV patient population which continues to grow in the United States.  A large portion of this increase in incidence is attributable to the opioid crisis, IV drug use and HCV reinfection, especially among younger adults.  Additionally, improved therapies may eliminate the need for ribavirin in patients suffering from decompensated cirrhosis.  Clinical studies of ruzasvir conducted by Merck and clinical studies of bemnifosbuvir conducted by us each demonstrated potent antiviral activity in HCV-infected patients as well as favorable tolerability.  In vitro synergy of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir in inhibiting HCV replication has also been observed.   We believe that the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to benefit the populations of HCV-infected patients increasing in the United States and globally, including, in particular, those who are most difficult to treat.
 Develop AT-752 as the potential first oral antiviral treatment for dengue fever.  Dengue virus infects approximately 400 million people each year and there are no approved oral antiviral treatments available. AT-752 is a purine nucleotide prodrug product candidate derived from our proprietary nucleotide platform. 
 5

Peer-reviewed published data showed potent in vitro activity against all serotypes tested and demonstrated antiviral activity in an animal models. The safety, tolerability and PK of AT-752 has been evaluated in a completed Phase 1 study in healthy subjects.  These data support the continued evaluation of AT-752 in Phase 2 studies in dengue-infected patients.  We believe that AT-752, if approved, has the potential to become the first pharmaceutical for the treatment and prophylaxis of dengue fever. 
 Leverage the drug discovery and development experience of our team. We believe that building a successful antiviral-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of identification of unmet patient needs, medicinal chemistry, drug discovery, preclinical and clinical development, and regulatory affairs. We have assembled and are utilizing the expertise and experience of a team with a demonstrated track record of efficiently and successfully discovering, developing and obtaining global regulatory approval for innovative antiviral therapeutics. 
 Maximize the value of our product candidates. We generally intend to retain global commercialization rights to our product candidates, which we believe will allow us to retain the greatest potential value of our product portfolio. However, we may opportunistically enter into license agreements or collaborations where we believe there is an opportunity, particularly outside the United States, to maximize the value and accelerate the development of our product candidates and potential commercialization of any products. Currently, we plan to establish our own commercial organization in the United States, and we may build additional commercial organizations in other selected markets for any of our product candidates that are approved.
 Maintain our scientifically rigorous approach and culture of tireless commitment to patients. The patients we seek to treat suffer from life-threatening viral infections for which there are no approved therapies or where there may be an opportunity to improve upon existing therapies. Members of our team, who have dedicated their lives to discovering, developing, and commercializing novel antiviral therapies for severe or life-threatening viral infections, are bringing this commitment and scientific rigor to our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize innovative and differentiated products for patients suffering from COVID-19, HCV, dengue and RSV.  
 Antiviral Therapy
 Background on viruses
 Viruses are cellular parasites that can only replicate using a host cell’s replication processes, as viruses lack the machinery required to survive and replicate on their own. Unlike living organisms that use DNA as the basis for their genetic material, viruses can use either DNA or RNA. Approximately 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses.
 Viruses have two primary components: nucleic acid (single or double stranded RNA or DNA) and a protective shell (the capsid). Some viruses may also have a lipid bilayer (the envelope) surrounding the capsid, an additional membrane derived from host cell membranes that contains viral proteins.
 The viral replication process begins when a virus attaches itself to a specific receptor site on the host-cell membrane through attachment proteins. The replication mechanism is dependent upon whether the virus is an RNA or DNA virus. Most DNA viruses use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is used to copy the viral genome or is transcribed to messenger RNA (“mRNA”). RNA viruses use their RNA as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNAs. The mRNAs encode both nonstructural proteins responsible for viral replication and transcription and structural proteins responsible for viral assembly. Finally, the newly created virus particles (“virions”), are released from the host cell in order to repeat the infection and replication cycle. RNA viruses can be particularly challenging to treat, as the error rates around the viral RNA polymerase directed RNA synthesis cause high mutation rates during reproduction, creating variants and resistance challenges for antiviral therapies.
 Background of ssRNA viruses
 RNA viruses can be single stranded (ssRNA) viruses or double-stranded (dsRNA), viruses, depending on the type of RNA used as the genetic material. A virus encased within a lipid bilayer is known as an enveloped virus, while a virus without this bilayer is called a non-enveloped virus. Enveloped ssRNA viruses are the more prevalent cause of severe human viral diseases. Studies from the last decade have 
 6

placed RNA viruses as primary etiological agents of many emerging human pathogens, representing up to 50% of all emerging infectious diseases. Types of enveloped and non-enveloped ssRNA viruses and some of the diseases they cause are shown in the table below, with the types of ssRNA viruses that we are currently targeting with our product candidates highlighted in yellow.

Over the last 40 years, a great deal of progress has been made in the treatment of some of the most severe viral infections. However, many highly pathogenic ssRNA viruses, including dengue virus and newly emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and its evolving variants, continue to cause severe viral diseases which still remain inadequately treated or not treated at all.
 Viral polymerase as an antiviral target
 From the discovery and approval of the first antiviral drug in 1963, there have been more than 100 antiviral drugs approved in the United States for the treatment of nine different human viral diseases. A historical challenge with the treatment of intracellular viruses has been selectivity or discovering drug targets that can completely inhibit viral replication without harming the host cells, leading to toxic side effects. Advances in technology and high throughput screening in recent years have driven the discovery of more selective antiviral product candidates. The viral polymerase, which is the single protein present in all RNA viruses, is a key enzyme in the replication of viruses, making for an ideal drug target as its core structural features are highly conserved across different viruses. There are four types of viral polymerase, depending upon the virus and its genomic makeup:
  
• | RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (“RdRp”): All ssRNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and HCV, depend on the RdRp, encoded in the viral genome, for replication and transcription. Since these enzymes are not present in the host cell, this facilitates the design of selective inhibitors of viral replication, which target viral but not host cell polymerases.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (“DdDP”): DdDP is used by DNA viruses to replicate their genome.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (“reverse transcriptase”): Reverse transcriptase is used by certain DNA or RNA viruses, such as HBV and HIV-1, to replicate their genomes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (“DdRP”): DdRP is used by DNA viruses to transcribe mRNA from DNA templates during replication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As viral RNA polymerase-based synthesis does not occur in human host cells, antiviral drug development for RNA viruses focuses on identifying selective drug-like molecules that target viral RNA polymerase. Advances in technology have enabled intensive structural and functional studies of viral RNA polymerase 
 7

including the identification in the case of SARS-CoV-2 of nidovirus RdRp associated nucleotidyltranferase (“NiRAN”), and have opened avenues for the development of new and more effective antiviral therapies. 
 Viral resistance and variants
 A major obstacle to antiviral therapy is viral resistance. Resistance is a function of a virus’ ability to genetically mutate, which, in the case of RNA viruses, is substantially higher than DNA viruses, as most RdRp lack proofreading abilities. The rate of mutation of RNA viruses can occur at six orders of magnitude greater than the rate of mutation of host cells. The ability of viruses to evolve makes the design of ssRNA-directed therapies challenging, as these viral strains continue to mutate and become more resistant to certain antiviral therapies over time. Since all the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of bemnifosbuvir and AT-752 to their active triphosphate are designed to be essentially ubiquitous host cell enzymes and not virally encoded proteins, we believe that the high rate of viral mutation does not affect the activation of the prodrug.
 Another consequence of viral mutations is the emergence of new variants. For example, each year the genetic mutations accumulated in the influenza virus cause antigen drift that could significantly impact immune recognition, thus the flu vaccines have to be reviewed and updated.  SARS-CoV-2, despite the fact that it does have a proof-reading function with the nsp14 exonuclease, has proven to be able to mutate quickly as well. More than six million SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified since fall 2020, including alpha (B.1.1.7) in the U.K., beta (B.1.351) in South Africa, gamma (P.1) in Brazil, delta (B.1.617.2) in India, and omicron (B.1.1.529) in South Africa.
A number of these variants have been designated by WHO and CDC as Variants of Concern (VOC) or Variants of Interest (VOI) because there is evidence of increased transmissibility, more severe disease, reduced effectiveness of vaccines or antibodies, or diagnostic detection failures. For example, it is estimated that the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines is reduced by >50% for the omicron variant vs. delta variant without a booster. The neutralizing activity of bamlanivimab, etesevimab, casirivimab and imdevimab, monoclonal antibodies authorized for treatment of high risk COVID-19 patients, was reduced by >500 fold against omicron, the most recent prevalent variant, rendering those monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Given the mutagenic nature of the virus, we expect that the evolution of the virus will continue with more variants emerging and presenting new and varied health challenges.

Nucleos(t)ide analogs and prodrugs
 Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), which comprise human and viral genetic material, are composed of natural chemical compounds termed nucleosides and nucleotides. Nucleos(t)ide analogs, which are synthetic compounds that mimic the structure of naturally occurring nucleosides and nucleotides, target the viral polymerase directly so that it mistakenly incorporates these analogs into nascent nucleic acids, causing inhibition of viral replication. Nucleos(t)ide analogs, compared to other classes of antiviral therapies, have a high barrier to viral resistance due to the conservation of the structure of the polymerase that is required to produce viable virions.
 Prodrugs of nucleos(t)ide analogs have become the backbone of single-drug and combination-drug therapies to treat life threatening viral infections, including HIV, HBV, and HCV. Prodrugs are employed to bypass rate limiting activation steps and to improve the oral bioavailability and permeation of cell membranes by the nucleos(t)ide analog.
 Our Nucleotide Prodrug Platform
 Leveraging our deep understanding of antiviral drug development, nucleos(t)ide chemistry, biochemistry and virology, we have built a proprietary purine nucleotide prodrug platform to develop novel treatments for life threatening diseases caused by ssRNA viral infections.
 Our proprietary nucleotide prodrug platform, as illustrated below, is comprised of the following critical components:
  
• | specific modifications at the 6-position of the purine base, acting as a prodrug, are designed to prevent the toxic effects of other such modifications and enhance cell membrane permeability, resulting in an intermediate metabolite that maximizes formation of the triphosphate active metabolite in cells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | stereospecific phosphoramidate, acting as a prodrug, designed to bypass the first rate-limiting phosphorylation enzyme in the intracellular activation pathway;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specific modifications in the sugar moiety of the purine nucleotide scaffold, producing potent antiviral activity with a high degree of selectivity; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | highly specific salt form to enhance solubility and drug bioavailability.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Atea’s purine nucleotide prodrug platform
 
We believe that product candidates derived from our platform, which combines unique purine nucleotide scaffolds with a novel double prodrug strategy, have the following potential advantageous characteristics and features:
  
• | enhanced antiviral activity and selectivity, as well as well-established pharmacology and animal models to predict clinical activity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | favorable safety profile;

• | convenience of oral administration; and

• | efficient, predictable, scalable, and reproducible manufacturing, as well as long shelf life for potential stockpiling.

Development Programs
 Bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of COVID-19  
 Although vaccines have an important role in improving a patient’s chance of having a milder form of disease and mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, as COVID-19 becomes endemic we believe that there will be a continuing need for novel, orally available treatment options, to stay ahead of both increasingly infectious variants and the potential resistance to currently available single agent oral therapies which may emerge in the future.  
 While effective vaccines are available, global adoption, access and utilization of vaccines remains limited.  In addition, breakthrough infection can occur because the current vaccines are not 100% effective and variants have had an impact on their efficacy.  With the continuing prevalence of COVID-19 globally, there is heightened risk of a further mutation of the virus that could evade one or more of the current 
 10

vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments. Thus, we believe there is an urgent need for effective, safe, oral, antiviral treatments.
 Paxlovid™ and molnupiravir have provided important evidence regarding the impact that easily administered oral direct acting antivirals can have on preventing disease progression, hospitalization and death.  As additional oral therapies are developed and are added to the treatment armamentarium, we believe that combination regimens will be needed to cover broader patient populations, as newer variants emerge, and resistance develops with the use of single agents alone.  
 We believe that nucleoside analogues are well suited to serve as the backbone of a combination regimen since antiviral activity is expected to remain even in the presence of newly emerging variants.  More specifically, we believe bemnifosbuvir is a particularly well-suited product candidate for development in COVID-19 combination regimens as it been shown to inhibit the highly conserved viral RNA polymerase at both the NiRAN and RdRp functional domains and has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials conducted to date.    
 SARS-CoV-2
 Background
 SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, belonging to the Coronaviridae family, and is an enveloped virus with a positive sense ssRNA genome which encodes 29 viral proteins. It is one of six other human coronaviruses that exist, with four responsible for one third of common cold infections. 
 SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to two other life-threatening coronaviruses: SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (“MERS-CoV-1”).
 SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical virus that carries four different structural proteins: spike protein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. As shown in the illustration below, the infection cycle begins when the spike proteins bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular receptor (“ACE2”), on the surface of the target cells. A second cell surface protein, transmembrane serine protease 2 (“TMPRSS2”), enables the virion to enter the cell, where it releases its RNA. Some of this RNA is translated into new proteins using the host cell’s machinery—these proteins include the four structural proteins, as well as a number of non-structural proteins (“nsps”), that form the replication complex. Within this complex, RdRps catalyze the synthesis of the approximately 30,000-nucleotide RNA viral genome. The proteins and RNA are then assembled into a new virion in the Golgi and released through exocytosis.
 

COVID-19
 An epidemic of cases with unexplained lower respiratory tract infections was first detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China’s Hubei province, and was reported to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Country Office in China on 31 December 2019. The WHO subsequently declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. This infectious disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO, is caused by the novel coronavirus strain SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
 Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be asymptomatic or it may cause a wide spectrum of illness ranging from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe life-threatening sepsis and multiorgan failure. Commonly reported symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, fatigue,

headaches, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance. Symptoms typically last two to three weeks, but many patients continue to experience symptoms for many weeks or develop new symptoms, which is now recognized as the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, or Long COVID. Approximately 10% of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 report symptoms three months later, and up to 89% of hospitalized patients continue to experience symptoms two months after the onset of their illness. COVID-19 affects people of all ages; however, people who are immunocompromised, elderly, or have certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease; diabetes, obesity, and cancer) are at increased risk of poor outcomes.
 Current vaccine and treatment landscape
 Several vaccines are approved or authorized for emergency use and additional vaccines are being developed to prevent infection and to create herd immunity, with the aim of preventing disease and reducing the amount of virus circulating within the community.  In December 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (“EUA”) for vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech and Moderna, Inc., each of which announced clinical trial results showing that their respective vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 during such trials.  In February 2021, the FDA granted EUA to a vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Company. In August 2021, the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech received full FDA approval. In January 2022, the vaccine from Moderna, Inc. received full FDA approval. In addition to the vaccines authorized for use in the United States, at least five other vaccines have been distributed worldwide. Furthermore, in December of 2021, the FDA granted EUA to the monoclonal antibody combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients and those unable to receive any of the available COVID vaccines.
 Antiviral therapies are complementary to vaccines, and preventative therapies.  We anticipate that antivirals will continue to be essential because of uncertainties around the level of immunity that the existing options will be able to generate, the durability of such immunity and the emergence of new variants of the virus that could change and potentially lessen the effectiveness of vaccines.   In November 2021, molnupiravir, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral being developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the outpatient setting, received conditional authorization for use from the health authorities in the United Kingdom. In December 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for molnupiravir. Merck and Ridgeback are currently seeking similar authorizations from numerous other global health authorities. In December 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for Pfizer’s Paxlovid, an orally administered direct-acting antiviral for the treatment of adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. In January 2022, the European Medicines Agency recommended conditional marketing authorization for Paxlovid and the FDA expanded the EUA of remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral that is a RdRp inhibitor, to include the treatment of outpatients at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19 illness.  
 Other products for the treatment of COVID-19 are currently authorized for emergency use or approved by health regulatory authorities in numerous countries throughout the world. These products include sotrovimab, (VIR Biotechnology, Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline) and bebtelovimab (Eli Lilly), both are monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of high-risk adults and adolescents with mild to moderate COVID-19.  Antibody therapies, including those that are currently authorized for emergency use as well as those in development, may have application in prevention as well as treatment.  However, the antibodies currently in use and in development require parenteral administration and are historically more complex than small molecules to manufacture. We believe that these two factors will impact and limit the use of antibodies for the treatment of patients, particularly outpatients with COVID-19.   In addition, the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapies has been adversely effected by different SARS-CoV-2 variant strains. Recently both monoclonal antibody combination therapies of bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab have effectively lost authorization in the United States due to lack of susceptibility to the omicron (B.1.1.529) strain. 
 In addition to our antiviral candidate, bemnifosbuvir, other antiviral drug candidates are currently in development.  These include, without limitation, GS-5245, an oral remdesivir prodrug which is expected to soon be in Phase 1 being developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., S-217622, an oral protease inhibitor being developed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd, EDP-235, an oral protease inhibitor in a first in human study 
 12

being developed by Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and numerous other protease inhibitors that are still early in their development.
 In addition to treatments directed at the virus, there are other immunomodulatory therapies such as interleukin-6 inhibitors, steroids, JAK inhibitors, and anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies which are being developed to treat the host inflammatory response to the disease. 
 Our approach
 We are developing bemnifosbuvir, an investigational, orally administered, novel antiviral product candidate, for the treatment of COVID-19.  As drug products comprised of single agents are more widely utilized by larger, broader populations of patients over time, we believe that resistance to these single agents will develop, especially for those agents which do not target highly conserved sites on the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Therefore, we anticipate that future treatments for COVID-19 will preferentially consist of combination regimens including multiple drugs, with differing/complementary mechanisms of action (simultaneously targeting multiple points in the viral replication cycle) and a high barrier to resistance.  As bemnifosbuvir uniquely inhibits the highly conserved viral RNA polymerase at both the NiRAN and RdRp functional domains, our development strategy is to evaluate bemnifosbuvir as part of nucleos(t)ide-based combination regimens. 
 Targeting SARS-COV-2 NiRAN/RdRp to treat COVID-19  
 The RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 supports the transcription and replication of their approximately 30,000-nucleotide viral RNA genomes. It is the largest and most complex RNA synthesis machinery among RNA viruses. As shown in the illustration below, the multi-subunit SARS-CoV polymerase complex is composed of a number of nsps including viral RdRp (nsp12), processivity factors (nsp7, nsp8), a proofreading exonuclease, a N7-methyl transferase (nsp14), and a helicase (nsp13). The nsp12 protein contains two domains, a RdRp core, which is the catalytic subunit incorporating ribonucleotides into RNA templates, and a N-terminal NiRAN domain, the function of which was previously unknown.  
 

SARS-CoV RNA Polymerase
 We have investigated the mechanism by which SARS-CoV initiates viral RNA synthesis and have discovered that there are two distinct pathways: one protein-primed and mediated by the NiRAN through the UMPylation of nsp8, and the other through de novo synthesis of dinucleotide primers in a NiRAN-independent manner. Importantly, both functions can be inhibited by AT-9010, the active triphosphate metabolite of bemnifosbuvir. Furthermore, we have obtained a 2.98 Å cryo-EM quaternary structure of nsp12/7/8/RNA/AT-9100, which confirms that AT-9010 not only bound to the NiRAN active site but also was incorporated by the RdRp and functions as a chain terminator.  We believe this unique dual mechanism of bemnifosbuvir creates a potentially higher barrier to resistance compared to other direct acting antiviral inhibitors. 
 13

Since bemnifosbuvir targets viral RNA polymerase, a highly conserved enzyme critical to viral replication and transcription, we expect it will maintain its antiviral activity even against the recently emerged variants with mutations in the spike (S) protein responsible for the receptor recognition and host cell membrane fusion process. COVID-19 variants have affected the effectiveness of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies due to the mutations in the viral spike protein and future variants may also impact the effectiveness of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.
 Potent In vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication across variants
 We assessed the in vitro potency of AT-511 (free base of bemnifosbuvir) against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest. The data from these studies are summarized in the table below showing that AT-511 maintained its potency against all major variants of concern or interest tested. These data support the key mechanistic advantage of the compound, which targets the highly conserved viral RNA polymerase. 

*Determined side-by-side in the same assay
EC90 differences between variants were within in vitro assay variations
**No new mutation in RNA polymerase of Omicron as compared with other variants
 
Non-mutagenic
 Results from non-clinical studies indicate that bemnifosbuvir is non-mutagenic and non-teratogenic and it has shown no reproductive toxicity. 
 More specifically, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7.5 cells treated with AT-511 (the free base of bemnifosbuvir) by next generation sequencing (NGS) showed that bemnifosbuvir was not a mutagen (which is consistent with the lack of genotoxicity observed in the preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies) and did not introduce mutations in the viral genome. 

*Frequency threshold defined as presence of mutation in 0.2% or 0.1% of NGS reads
 In addition to the standard battery of safety pharmacology and repeat dose toxicity studies, which showed no adverse effects of bemnifosbuvir treatment in rats and non-human primates at respective doses up to 650 and 1000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks, new completed preclinical studies have demonstrated that 
 14

bemnifosbuvir did not affect male or female fertility in treated rats, did not affect early embryo-fetal development in treated pregnant rats or rabbits, and did not affect the pre- or post-natal development, reproductive capability, or behavioral assessments of the offspring of rats treated prior to and during mating (males) and prior to mating through pregnancy and lactation (females).
 Multi-Pronged Approach to identification of protease inhibitor for combination therapy with bemnifosbuvir  
 To accelerate the development of a combination regimen for the treatment of COVID-19, we plan to initially study the combination of bemnifosbuvir with a protease inhibitor.  Although protease inhibitors as a class may be susceptible to resistance if used as a single agent, they have demonstrated antiviral activity in COVID-19.  We have initiated preclinical in vitro combination studies of bemnifosbuvir with protease inhibitors to explore potential antiviral synergy and mitigation of potential viral resistance. 
 We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach to identification of a protease inhibitor that, together with bemnifosbuvir as the nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitor component, is intended to be a highly effective oral combination therapy that provides a high barrier to viral resistance for use in broad patient populations.  We have recently begun efforts to discover and select a protease inhibitor lead candidate, leveraging our expertise in medicinal chemistry, molecular virology, pharmacology, drug metabolism/pharmacokinetics, and toxicology.  In parallel, we are, through our business development efforts, evaluating opportunities to in-license a late stage preclinical or early stage clinical protease inhibitor product candidate to accelerate initiation of clinical development of a proprietary combination regimen.
 Clinical development history
 At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated our COVID-19 program with a global Phase 2 clinical trial of bemnifosbuvir in hospitalized patients.  The initiation of the global Phase 2 clinical in hospitalized patients was followed by the initiation, together with our former collaborator, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. and Genentech, Inc. (together, “Roche”), of a Phase 2 outpatient clinical trial (MOONSONG), a Phase 3 outpatient clinical trial (MORNINGSKY) and a Phase 3 six-month follow-up study (MEADOWSPRING) for patients that had been enrolled in MORNINGSKY.  These patient studies, with additional supporting Phase 1 and clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy subjects, were intended to support the development of bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of COVID-19 as a monotherapy, or single agent product. 
 Following the availability of orally available COVID-19 treatment options in November 2021 in the United States and certain other countries, the standard of care for the treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients changed. As additional oral therapies are developed and are added to the treatment armamentarium, we believe that combination regimens will be needed to cover broader patient populations, as newer variants emerge, and resistance develops with the use of single agents alone. In anticipation of this future need, we prioritized our clinical development strategy in January 2022 to focus on the development of a bemnifosbuvir combination regimen.  We anticipate that this proposed regimen will be comprised of bemnifosbuvir and a protease inhibitor, which is the drug class of Paxlovid™, one of the currently available oral treatment options.  In addition to lowering the possibility of emergence of viral resistance, combination therapies often result in additive or synergistic antiviral activity (i.e. resulting in greater activity than either of the single agents alone). 
 Together with Roche, we completed the Phase 2 outpatient (MOONSONG) clinical trial in October 2022 and we closed out each of the Phase 3 MORNINGSKY and MEADOWSPRING clinical trials in December 2021 and February 2022, respectively.   We closed out our Phase 2 hospitalized patient clinical trial in January 2022.  We intend to leverage the key clinical data obtained in the program to date, described below, to support our combination strategy.
 Global Phase 2 study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study that evaluated bemnifosbuvir in patients with moderate COVID-19 versus placebo.  An interim analysis was conducted (data cut as of May 2021) which included data from 70 hospitalized, high-risk patients with COVID-19 of which data from 62 patients were evaluable for virology analysis. Based on the interim analysis, after bemnifosbuvir 550 mg BID dosing for five days, rapid reduction in viral load levels were observed. At Day 2, patients receiving bemnifosbuvir experienced a 0.7 
 15

log10 greater mean reduction from baseline viral load versus placebo. A sustained difference in viral load reduction was maintained through Day 8.  


Bemnifosbuvir’s SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity was also observed in patients with baseline viral loads above the median of 5.26 log10 as compared to placebo.  In this subset, those in the bemnifosbuvir arm achieved SARS-CoV-2 clearance as early as Day 2 (in 6% of patients), Day 8 (in 7% of patients) Day 10 (in 33% of patients), and Day 12 (in 31% of patients) compared to 0% of patients in the placebo arm at the same timepoints. By Day 14 (last viral sampling study day) approximately 47% of patients in the bemnifosbuvir arm and 22% in the placebo arm had no detectable RNA virus.
 

After dosing with 550 mg BID for five days, bemnifosbuvir was generally well tolerated and there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Non-serious adverse events were equally distributed across treatment arms. Most were mild-to-moderate in severity and assessed as not related to the study drug. 
 After the interim analysis described above, we amended this placebo-controlled study to explore higher doses of bemnifosbuvir, specifically 1100 mg BID over five days.  In January 2022, we closed out the study to prioritize development of a combination regimen. 
 Global Phase 2 MOONSONG trial: This study was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled trial, that evaluated the antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetics of sequential doses of 
 16

bemnifosbuvir 550 mg (Cohort A, n=30) and 1,100 mg (Cohort B, n=30) with BID dosing in adult outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 versus placebo (n=40).  Treatment with bemnifosbuvir in this study did not meet the primary endpoint of showing a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the overall population of patients compared to placebo, of whom approximately two thirds were low-risk with mild symptoms.  However, in high-risk patients with underlying health conditions, a reduction of viral load of approximately 0.5 log10 at Day 7 was observed with administration of 550 mg BID as compared to placebo (prespecified subgroup analysis Cohort A n=7; placebo n=10) and with administration of 1,100 mg BID as compared to pooled placebo (exploratory subgroup analysis Cohort B; n=14; placebo n=7).
 Additional exploratory data reported from the Phase 2 MOONSONG trial showed rapid and potent antiviral effect of bemnifosbuvir as measured by an infectious virus assay which detected the amount of “live” virus capable of replication. The exploratory analysis included approximately 71% of all patients in MOONSONG (Cohort A and B) who had positive baseline cultures. 
 The results from the Phase 2 MOONSONG study include the following observations: 
  
• | rapid and potent reduction in viral load of -0.5 log10 in the evaluable patient population (low and high risk, majority seropositive) of Cohort B with 1,100 mg BID bemnifosbuvir (n=18) versus placebo (n=6) at Day 3 of the study period (post-hoc exploratory analysis);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rapid and potent reduction in viral load of -0.9 log10 in the high-risk patient subgroup (post-hoc exploratory subgroup analysis) of Cohort B with 1,100 mg BID mg (n=11) versus placebo (n=4) at Day 3; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduction in viral load of -0.3 log10 in the high-risk patient subgroup (pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis) of Cohort A with 550 mg BID (n=8) versus placebo (n=6) at Day 3, suggesting a dose response for bemnifosbuvir.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Bemnifosbuvir was generally well tolerated in this study. The proportion of patients experiencing any adverse event (AE) was 20% in the placebo group, 20% in the bemnifosbuvir 550 mg BID group and 27% in the bemnifosbuvir 1100 mg BID group. There were three non-drug related serious adverse events (SAEs) in each of the treatment groups and all other AEs were grade 1 or 2.  Gastrointestinal (GI)-related AEs were the most commonly reported AEs: 8% in the placebo group; 7% in the bemnifosbuvir 550 mg BID group; 17% in the bemnifosbuvir 1100 mg BID group, with mild to moderate nausea/vomiting resulting in premature study drug discontinuation of 3% in the placebo group, 0% in the bemnifosbuvir 550 mg BID group  and 17% in the bemnifosbuvir 1100 mg BID group. No clinically significant differences in laboratory abnormalities were observed in the treatment arms as compared to placebo.
 Global Phase 3 MORNINGSKY and MEADOWSPRING trials: The MORNINGSKY study evaluating the effects of bemnifosbuvir in non-hospitalized adult and adolescent participants with mild or moderate 
 17

COVID-19 was closed out in December 2021.  In February 2022, MEADOWSPRING, originally designed as a six-month Phase 3 follow-up study of participants previously enrolled in MORNINGSKY, was closed out with enrolled patients reaching three rather than six months of follow-up.
 Phase 1 and clinical pharmacology studies 
 In addition to the Phase 2 clinical trials, supporting Phase 1 and clinical pharmacology studies, including a bronchoalveolar lavage study, multiple drug-drug interaction studies and a mass balance study, have been conducted and completed since we initiated our COVID-19 program.  In these studies, the safety and PK of bemnifosbuvir has been evaluated at doses up to 1100 mg BID for 5 days in healthy subjects.
 Results from the bronchoalveolar lavage study in healthy subjects demonstrated that bemnifosbuvir was efficiently delivered to the lungs (epithelial lining fluid, ELF), the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Five clinical drug-drug interaction studies were completed with topline results demonstrating an overall low drug-drug interaction potential associated with bemnifosbuvir.
 Bemnifosbuvir has been generally well tolerated in healthy subjects.  Consistent with the results from the Phase 2 outpatient clinical trial (MOONSONG), an increased incidence of mild to moderate GI-related adverse events, specifically nausea and vomiting, were observed at 1,100 mg BID in healthy subjects.
 Currently we are conducting a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects to evaluate the tolerability of AT-527 after dosing with or without food to assess whether the mild GI-related events observed at the 1,100 mg BID dose can be mitigated. 
 Bemnifosbuvir and Ruzasvir for the Treatment of Hepatitis C  
 Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
 Background
 HCV is a blood-borne, positive sense, ssRNA virus, primarily infecting cells of the liver. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplants and spreads via blood transfusion, hemodialysis and needle sticks. In the United States, injection drug use accounts for approximately 60% of all new cases of HCV. Diagnosis of HCV is made through blood tests, including molecular tests that allow for the detection, quantification and analysis of viral genomes and the classification of an infection into specific viral genotypes. Hepatitis C becomes chronic Hepatitis C in 75% to 85% of cases, with an incubation period lasting from two to 26 weeks.
 HCV is classified into seven genotypes and 67 subtypes, with genotype 1 being responsible for more than 70% of HCV cases in the United States. Patients with HCV are also classified by liver function status: compensated cirrhosis (liver scarring) denotes those patients that do not yet have impaired liver function, while decompensated cirrhosis describes patients with moderate to severe liver function impairment.
 According to the WHO, an estimated 58 million people globally have chronic HCV infection, with about 1.5 million new infections occurring per year.  Approximately 290,000 people die every year from HCV related liver diseases, with the majority of death resulting from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC - primary liver cancer).
 Despite significant advances in treatment beginning in 2013, there remains a large, underserved, HCV patient population which continues to grow dramatically in the United States. While a portion of this increase results from increased diagnosis of HCV that began following the 2013 CDC issuance of guidelines for screening of all Americans born between the years 1945 and 1965, a large portion of this increase in incidence is attributable to the opioid crisis, IV drug use and HCV reinfection.  The US HCV prevalence is expected to continue to remain steady over the coming years as rising HCV incidence offsets the number of new patients treated.
 18

Increasing incidence of HCV in the United States
It is estimated that a substantial global market for HCV therapeutics will exist to 2050 and beyond. Estimated at approximately $4 billion in global sales in 2021, with approximately 50% attributable to the United States, the HCV market remains large.  We believe the U.S. HCV prevalence will remain steady over the coming years as rising HCV incidence offsets the number of new patients treated. 
 Current treatment landscape
 No vaccine exists for the prevention of HCV, but beginning in 2013 several sequentially introduced and improved oral antiviral therapeutics have boosted sustained virologic response rates to over 95% in a majority of patients, with treatment durations of eight to 12 weeks depending upon the regimen and patient population. The leading HCV products are comprised of a combination of agents with differing mechanisms of action and therapeutic targets: NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B nucleos(t)ide polymerase inhibitors. A patient’s genotype, cirrhotic status, and prior treatment failures determine the appropriate antiviral therapeutic used in treatment. In the United States, currently the two leading therapeutics for treatment of chronic HCV are:
 Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir): Epclusa, a combination regimen consisting of an NS5B inhibitor and an NS5A inhibitor, was first approved by the FDA in 2016 for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection with any of genotypes one through six infection, either without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, Epclusa is approved for use in combination with ribavirin. Patients on Epclusa require 12 weeks of treatment.
 Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir): Mavyret, a combination regimen consisting of a NS3/4A protease inhibitor and an NS5A inhibitor was first approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV with any of genotypes one through six infection, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Mavyret is also approved for HCV patients with genotype 1 infection who have been previously treated with a regimen either containing an NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (but not both). Mavyret was the first eight-week treatment approved for HCV genotypes one through six in adult patients without cirrhosis who have not been previously treated. In 2019, the FDA approved shortening the treatment duration from 12 weeks to eight weeks in treatment-naïve, compensated cirrhotic HCV patients 
 19

across genotypes one through six. Mavyret is not approved for use in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
 With the exception of our HCV combination product candidate and CC-31244, an NS5B inhibitor product candidate from Cocrystal Pharma, Inc., which is currently in Phase 2 clinical development, we are not aware of any other product candidates for the treatment of HCV in late stage clinical development in the United States.
 Our approach
 We are developing bemnifosbuvir in combination with ruzasvir.  Ruzasvir is an investigational oral, pan genotypic NS5A inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV infection that we licensed from Merck in December 2021.  Based on our preclinical and clinical data to date relating to bemnifosbuvir, together with data that Merck generated relating to ruzasvir, we believe that this combination, if approved, could offer the following potential benefits:
  
• | Short treatment duration of eight weeks in HCV-infected patients with and without cirrhosis (compensated cirrhosis).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equivalent antiviral potency across all genotypes, regardless of cirrhosis status, including the difficult to treat genotype-3 population.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obviate the need for extensive pretreatment assessments, including genotyping, procedures to assess cirrhosis, and liver function assessment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eliminate the need for ribavirin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Ribavirin, an antiviral first approved in 1986, carries several FDA boxed warnings, including the risk of hemolytic anemia and teratogenicity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated regimen, with low potential for drug-drug interactions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Clinical development
 To date, we have completed two clinical trials of bemnifosbuvir to support the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
 Phase 1 clinical trial of bemnifosbuvir
 We conducted a Phase 1 trial to evaluate single and multiple doses of bemnifosbuvir as a single agent in healthy and HCV-infected subjects for up to seven days. All HCV-infected subjects were treatment-naïve with HCV RNA ³ 5 log10 IU/mL. The objectives of the trial were to assess safety, tolerability, PK and antiviral activity.
 The trial evaluated single oral doses of bemnifosbuvir up to 400 mg salt form (369 mg free base) in healthy subjects (Part A), single doses up to 600 mg salt form (553 mg free base) in non-cirrhotic HCV-infected subjects (Part B), and multiple doses up to 600 mg salt form (553 mg free base) once daily for seven days in non-cirrhotic genotype 1b (“GT1”), HCV-infected subjects (Part C). Additional cohorts evaluated 600 mg salt form (553 mg free base) once daily for seven days in non-cirrhotic genotype 3 (“GT3”), (Part D) and Child-Pugh A cirrhotic (GT 1,2,3), HCV-infected subjects (Part E). The tables below show the dosage and mean maximum HCV RNA reductions for each treatment cohort.
 A total of 88 subjects were dosed across all parts of the trial, with 72 subjects who received active drug and 16 subjects who received placebo. In this trial, bemnifosbuvir showed equivalent pan-genotypic antiviral activity in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCV infected patients. The mean maximum HCV reduction after a single dose (Part B) was 2.3 log10 IU/mL, and the mean maximum HCV RNA reduction after seven days of dosing with bemnifosbuvir at 553 mg free base was 4.6 log10 IU/mL. Data also showed a mean maximum HCV RNA reduction of 4.4 log10 IU/mL after seven days of dosing of bemnifosbuvir at 553 mg free base in non-cirrhotic genotype 1b (“GT1b”), HCV-infected subjects, and a mean reduction of 4.5 log10 IU/mL after seven days of dosing in non-cirrhotic GT3 HCV-infected subjects. The PK data in cirrhotic subjects was similar to non-cirrhotic subjects. Emax modeling predicted that a dose of 553 mg free base of bemnifosbuvir once daily would result in maximum viral load reduction.

 Phase 2 clinical trial of bemnifosbuvir in combination with daclatasivr
 We conducted a Phase 2, open-label clinical trial to evaluate bemnifosbuvir in combination with daclatasvir, an approved commercially available HCV NS5A inhibitor, in HCV-infected subjects. Ten treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic GT1 HCV-infected subjects received 553 mg free base bemnifosbuvir and 60 mg daclatasvir once daily for a period of eight or 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was SVR12 (a sustained viral response, defined as HCV RNA < lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at 12 weeks after end of treatment (EOT)).  Secondary efficacy endpoints included HCV RNA< Lower Limit Of Quantitation (“LLOQ”), and Target Not Detected (“TND”)(an assessment of virologic response that is more rigorous than LLOQ), by study visit, virologic failure, and appearance of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) to either of the study drugs. 
 Despite the use of a less potent first-generation HCV NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir, all subjects achieved HCV RNA < LLOQ and TND at the end of treatment (EOT); nine of the 10 subjects achieved SVR12. One subject who was TND by week 2 received 8 weeks of treatment, achieved SVR4, and then experienced likely virologic relapse at post-treatment week 12. The single subject who relapsed with GT 1b virus had the following multiple RAVs/variants both at baseline and at the SVR12 timepoint: NS5A: R30Q; NS5B: L159F/A218S/C316N.  Phenotypic analysis demonstrated that bemnifosbuvir retained the same potency against clinical isolates obtained from this relapsed subject at baseline and SVR12 (only a 1.1 and 0.8-
 21

fold shift, respectively, in EC50 compared to reference). Compared to sofosbuvir, the EC50 and EC90 values for bemnifosbuvir were ~10-fold lower. Thus, the significance of the RAVs in this case is unclear.  No other subjects had pre-existing NS5A RAVs at baseline.
 As shown in the graph below, viral load decreased rapidly after initiation of study drugs, with 70% of subjects achieving plasma HCV RNA < LLOQ by week 2 (and 50% achieving TND by week 2). We believe that the rapid early clearance of HCV RNA observed in this trial supports continued evaluation of bemnifosbuvir in shortened treatment regimens, ideally with a more potent, next-generation HCV NS5A inhibitor.

 Bemnifosbuvir HCV safety 
 There were no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities or adverse events leading to trial discontinuation observed in our HCV Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials of bemnifosbuvir. The most common side effects observed were headache and small increases in blood lipid levels, with no consistent patterns in other reported effects. Most side effects were not severe and were not thought to be related to bemnifosbuvir.
 Ruzasvir
 Ruzasvir is an investigational oral, highly potent pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor that we licensed from Merck in December 2021.  In studies conducted by Merck, ruzasvir demonstrated in vitro potent antiviral activity with an EC50 in the sub- to low picomolar range against all HCV genotypes (<10 pM against GTs 1-7).  The antiviral activity of ruzasvir was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study in HCV-infected patients, where viral load reductions >3 log10 were observed in GT1, GT2 and GT3-infected patients after treatment with monotherapy.  This potent clinical antiviral activity is on par with what was achieved, as single agents, with velpatasvir and pibrentasvir, the NS5A inhibitor components of Mavyret and Epclusa, respectively. These proof-of-concept data supported evaluation of ruzasvir in larger phase 2 multiple drug combination studies (including 2 and 3 drug regimens) previously conducted by Merck.  These studies 
 22

included treatment-naïve and interferon-experienced patients with or without compensated cirrhosis.  In general, high SVR12 rates (>90%) were observed in 2-drug combination studies (ruzasvir plus uprifosbuvir, a pyrimidine nucleotide prodrug, for 12 weeks) conducted by Merck in GT1, GT2, GT4 and GT6-infected patients (C-Breeze 1 and 2). A lower SVR12 rate was observed in GT-3 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (40% SVR12; C-Breeze 1).  Atea believes this lower rate is attributed to the reduced antiviral activity associated with the nucleotide uprifosbuvir in GT-3 cirrhotic subjects as an increase in ruzasvir dose to 180 mg substantially increased the SVR12 rate in this population (68% SVR12; C-Breeze 2), highlighting the preserved dose-related clinical antiviral activity of ruzasvir in GT-3 subjects with cirrhosis.
 Over 1200 HCV-infected participants have received ruzasvir at daily doses up to 180 mg for durations up to 24 weeks as part of 2-drug and 3-drug regimens with or without ribavirin.  The overall safety data indicates that ruzasvir has been generally well-tolerated with no consistent treatment-related changes in labs, vital signs, or ECG safety parameter values.  Serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events were rare in all studies conducted by Merck.       
 Rationale supporting the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir for HCV
 With the antiviral potency observed with bemnifosbuvir, especially in more difficult to treat genotype-3 infected patients, we believe that the combination of ruzasvir and bemnifosbuvir has the potential to improve on the SVR12 rates observed in the prior studies conducted by Merck.
 To further support our development of the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir in patients, we have conducted in vitro synergy experiments in HCV GT1b replicon assays (Huh-luc/neo-ET), where HCV replicon cells were treated with multiple concentrations of AT-511, the free base of bemnifosbuvir, and ruzasvir either alone or in combination.  As shown in the figure below, these experiments demonstrated that the combination resulted in substantially greater inhibition of HCV replication than either agent alone, suggesting a synergistic antiviral effect between the two inhibitors.   
 In vitro Synergy: Assay performed in HCV GT1b replicon (Huh-luc/neo-ET)


Collectively, these data support the clinical development of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir used in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.
 Planned clinical development 
 In 2022, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial of bemnifosbuvir in combination with ruzasvir in treatment-naïve, HCV-infected patients either without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.  This study will 
 23

evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pan-genotypic combination consisting of 550 mg QD of bemnifosbuvir and 180 mg QD of ruzasvir after eight or 12 weeks of treatment.   
 Results from this study are intended to support future larger studies of bemnifosbuvir in combination with ruzasvir in broad patient populations for treatment durations of eight weeks or potentially less (six weeks) as well as in patients with decompensated cirrhosis for treatment durations of 12 weeks without ribavirin 
 Prior to our licensing of ruzasvir from Merck, we had been developing AT-777, an NS5A inhibitor, that we had intended to develop as part of a fixed dose combination with bemnifosbuvir (fixed dose combination was referred to as AT-787).  This program was paused at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic given industry-wide challenges in conducting clinical studies at that time. With the license from Merck, we have prioritized development of ruzasvir over AT-777/AT-787, and have no immediate plans to conduct clinical studies utilizing AT-777 or the combination AT-787.
 AT-752 for the treatment of dengue
 Background
 Dengue, which is caused by a positive sense ssRNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, is a mosquito-borne viral infection. Dengue causes flu-like symptoms in both children and adults and is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. There are five dengue viral serotypes, and infection with one serotype does not produce immunity to another serotype. Thus, a person could be infected with dengue multiple times and reinfection typically results in a more severe disease. Symptoms include fever, eye pain, headache, swollen glands, rash, muscle pain, bone pain, nausea, vomiting, and joint pain, and last two to seven days post-infection.
 Globally four billion people live in high-risk dengue areas, with up to 400 million infected each year, resulting in 500,000 hospitalizations. The WHO has called dengue the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. Although dengue rarely occurs in the continental United States, it is endemic in Puerto Rico, Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Islands, as shown in the map below. Seventy percent of the global disease burden for dengue is in Asia.


According to the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”), 5% of infected patients develop a life-threatening form of dengue called severe dengue. Those who develop severe dengue may have some or all of the following complications: severe abdominal pain, fatigue, severe bleeding, organ impairment, and plasma leakage. The mortality rate of severe dengue ranges between 12% and 44%, if left untreated. The global economic cost burden of dengue was estimated at $8.9 billion in 2013, with nearly 50% of the costs associated with hospitalizations. 
 Current treatment landscape
 There are no FDA or EU approved therapies indicated for the treatment of dengue. Current treatment protocols involve supportive care, including analgesics, judicious fluid replacement, and bed rest. In 2019, a vaccine, Dengvaxia developed by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. (“Sanofi”), was approved by the FDA for the prevention of disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in children ages nine to 16 with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and living in endemic areas.
 24

Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd, (“Takeda”), is also advancing a dengue vaccine, TAK-003, which is in Phase 3 development. Primary endpoint analysis of its ongoing Phase 3 trial in children ages four to 16 years showed protection against virologically-confirmed dengue.
 Therapeutic candidates in addition to AT-752 currently in clinical development for the treatment of dengue fever include a dengue NS4B inhibitor being developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies which is in Phase 2a development in adult patients with confirmed dengue fever and a dengue NS4B inhibitor being developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation which is in Phase 1 clinical development. 
 Our approach
 We are developing AT-752, an oral, purine nucleotide prodrug product candidate for the treatment of dengue. AT-752 has shown potent activity against all dengue serotypes and other flaviviruses tested in preclinical studies. AT-752 is designed to target the inhibition of the viral polymerase. We also intend to explore the potential development of AT-752 as a prophylactic treatment for dengue, which we believe, if approved, could be directed at the travelers’ market. 
 Preclinical development
 The antiviral activity of AT-281, the free base of AT-752, was evaluated against all four dengue serotypes in vitro.  These studies showed potent, concentration dependent inhibition of all dengue strains tested with EC50s ranging from 0.30 to 0.75 µM.

AT-281 was also evaluated under contract with the National Institutes of Health and Infectious Disease against a variety of flaviviruses. Huh-7 cells were infected with individual viral strains and exposed to serial dilutions of AT-281. A virally induced cytopathic effect (“CPE”) assay, using either a neutral red dye uptake endpoint or a virus yield reduction measurement using a standard endpoint dilution CCID50 assay, was used to measure the antiviral EC50 or EC90 value, respectively. Uninfected cell controls concurrently exposed to drug were used to determine cytotoxicity (CC50) using the CPE assay. AT-281 demonstrated sub-micromolar potencies against all flaviviruses tested (summarized in the table below). No toxicity was detected for AT-281 up to the highest concentration tested (172 µM).

aSI = selectivity index (CC50/EC90 or CC50/EC50);   bEC50
 We have evaluated the activity of AT-752 in a preclinical animal model of dengue disease in which AG129 mice were treated orally with AT-752 (1000 mg/kg, p.o.) four hours before subcutaneous inoculation with D2Y98P dengue strain followed by subsequent dosing of AT-752 twice daily (500 mg/kg, p.o.) for seven days, starting one hour post inoculation. All vehicle-treated mice succumbed to fatal central nervous system sequelae within 8 days of infection, as typically observed for this model; however, mice treated with AT-752 showed notable differences in overall health, survival, and viremia. As shown in the graphs below, viral RNA in serum was statistically significantly lower than control by day 6 and below the limit of detection (“LOD”) (LOD: 50 copies per mL) on day eight, after seven days of drug treatment.

26


Additionally, the potent antiviral activity of AT-752 was evaluated in a preclinical animal model of yellow fever virus disease in which hamsters were treated orally with AT-752 for seven days starting either four hours prior to inoculation (100, 300 or 1000 mg/kg) or two days post-inoculation (1000 mg/kg) with virus (Jimenez hamster-adapted strain V#2653). As shown in the graphs below, compared to animals treated with vehicle or the positive control ribavirin (50 mg/kg), weight loss prevention and survival were substantially improved when AT-752 treatment was started either before or after inoculation.  Furthermore, significant reductions in serum viral titers on day four and ALT levels (a measure of virally-impaired liver function) on day six were observed in all AT-752-treated animals.

 Clinical development
 Phase 1 clinical trial 
 We have recently completed a first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of AT-752.  This study was conducted in 65 healthy adults to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK (with embedded food effect) of AT-752. The study consisted of two sequential parts: Part A comprised of a single ascending dose including a food effect cohort and Part B comprised of multiple ascending doses. In this study, AT-752 was generally well tolerated after either single or multiple doses in healthy subjects.  There were no serious adverse events reported and no drug related drug discontinuations.  Most adverse events were Grade 1 (mild) in intensity and no adverse events with severity of Grade 3 or above were reported. The most common adverse events across both parts of the study were headache, nausea, and vomiting. Gastrointestinal-related events (e.g. nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation) were observed more commonly with AT-752 as compared to placebo, although cases were mild/moderate in intensity and were self-limiting or managed with ondansetron (vomiting). Most changes in laboratory parameters were mild (Grade 1) with no apparent relationship between the incidence of any laboratory abnomality and AT-752 dose level. 
 In 2022, we anticipate initiating two clinical trials of AT-752. One will be a human challenge study in the United States to evaluate viral load and viral kinetics in healthy subjects who are challenged with a Dengue Virus-1 Live Virus Human Challenge viral strain after receiving either AT-752 or placebo.  We currently anticipate that this study will begin in the first half of 2022. 
 Additionally, we are initiating a global Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial to evaluate PK, pharmacodynamics, and safety of AT-752 in patients with dengue infection.  
 28

This study which will be conducted in geographic regions where dengue fever is endemic and is expected to enroll approximately 60 subjects. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the antiviral activity of AT-752 versus placebo (reduction of dengue virus RNA from baseline) in adult subjects with confirmed dengue infection.
 We intend to pursue FDA expedited development and review programs for AT-752. Dengue is also defined as a tropical disease under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and therefore FDA approval of AT-752 for the treatment of Dengue may result in a tropical disease priority review voucher that may be used for a subsequent NDA or biologics license application.
 Candidates for the Treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) 
 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
 Background
 RSV, a negative ssRNA virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family, is a seasonal respiratory virus that can be serious for infants, older adults, and the immuno-compromised population. Although the virus is seasonal, the duration, peaks and severity of the virus vary each season. In the United States, RSV infections generally occur during fall, winter and spring, but the timing and severity can vary from year to year and from region to region.   Two different strains of the virus co-circulate each season, and RSV epidemics last from four to six months.
 Globally, RSV affects 64 million people, according to the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”), with annual mortality estimated at 160,000 deaths.  
 The primary symptoms of RSV infections include coughing, wheezing, fever, decreased appetite, and runny nose.  RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children in the United States. Almost all children contract the RSV infection by their third year of life with 75,000 to 125,000 children being hospitalized each year in the United States.  Globally, it is estimated that RSV results in 3.2 million hospital admissions in children younger than five years of age.
 Among the elderly, the CDC estimates that RSV is responsible for 177,000 hospitalizations in the United States. An estimated 14,000 annual deaths are caused by RSV in the United States in adults older than age 65.   Additionally, in immunocompromised persons, RSV can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. 
 Current treatment landscape
 Treatment for RSV typically focuses on supportive care, which can include nasal suction, fever management, hydration, and oxygen. The FDA approved aerosolized ribavirin in 1986 for the treatment of serious RSV infections in hospitalized children. However, ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, carries several safety concerns, including potential toxicity for exposed persons. Aerosolized ribavirin has not been approved for use in the elderly or immunocompromised populations.
 In addition, the FDA approved Synagis (palivizumab) in 1998 for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in children at high risk of RSV disease. Synagis is administered as an injection every month during RSV season. Synagis has not been approved for treatment of RSV, nor is it indicated for use in populations other than children under 24 months of age.
 There are multiple RSV therapeutic and prophylaxis products in clinical development for the pediatric and adult market segments, including late-stage vaccine candidates from GSK and Pfizer targeting the elderly and maternal populations, late-stage immuno-prophylaxis candidates from AZ and Merck targeting the pediatric population and therapeutic candidates from Enanta, Janssen and Ark Biopharm targeting the pediatric population.
 Our approach 
 Our development efforts in RSV are focused on inhibitors (both nucleosides and nucleotide prodrugs) of the RSV RdRp. We believe our RSV lead candidates have the potential to inhibit both the initiation of viral replication, as well as viral transcription. We plan to develop the selected product candidate in both oral and parenteral dosage formulations for both adult and pediatric patients.
 29

Development history
 We have terminated development of our previous lead candidate AT-889 and are focused on optimizing the inhibitory potency and selectivity of other leads in our library of nucleos(t)ide analogs 
 Development strategy
 Currently, we are evaluating the antiviral activity and selectivity of our lead compounds in in vitro studies to inform our selection of the most promising lead candidate. Once chosen, we will assess the in vivo antiviral activity of such lead candidate in a small animal model, and conduct IND-enabling toxicology and other required studies. Thereafter we intend to nominate a product candidate for clinical development. We anticipate nominating our lead candidate and initiating the IND-enabling studies in the second half of 2022. 
 Roche License Agreement
 In October 2020, we entered into the Roche License Agreement, with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Genentech, Inc. in connection with AT-511, bemnifosbuvir, their backup compounds (including AT-752) (the “Compounds”), products containing any Compound (the “Products”), and related companion diagnostics (the “Companion Diagnostics”).
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Roche License Agreement, we granted Roche (i) an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide (excluding the United States) license to make, sell, import and export the Compounds, the Products and the Companion Diagnostics in all fields of use, except for certain hepatitis C virus use (the “Field”), (ii) a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to make, import and export the Compounds, the Products and the Companion Diagnostics in the Field in the United States and (iii) a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to research and develop the Compounds, the Products and the Companion Diagnostics in the United States. We also agreed that Roche would manufacture the commercial supply of bemnifosbuvir. On February 22, 2021, we announced that Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in-licensed from Roche the exclusive right to develop and market bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Roche License Agreement, Roche granted us (i) an exclusive, sublicensable license to distribute, register and sell the Compounds and the Products in the United States, (ii) a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to research, develop, use, import, export and market the Compounds and the Products in the United States and (iii) a non-exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide (excluding the United States) license to research and develop the Compounds and the Products in the Field.
 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Roche License Agreement, Roche and we jointly developed bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19 on a worldwide-basis and equally shared the costs associated with such development activities. 
 As partial consideration of the rights we granted to Roche under the Roche License Agreement, Roche paid us an upfront payment of $350 million in November 2020. Additionally, upon realization of a development milestone in June 2021, we received an additional $50 million from Roche.
 On November 12, 2021, we received notice from Roche that they had elected to terminate the Roche License Agreement in its entirety on a worldwide basis including Japan, with an effective date of February 10, 2022.   On December 7, 2021, we delivered to Roche notice that we intended to continue the development of bemnifosbuvir and we have been working with Roche to effect an orderly wind down of activities in accordance with the terms of the Roche License Agreement.  The obligations of Roche to equally share the costs associated with development activities terminated on February 10, 2022.  We are now responsible for, and alone will bear the costs associated with the development of bemnifosbuvir.  Additionally, we remain liable to Roche for certain expenses associated with transition related activities occurring after the effective date of the termination of the Roche License Agreement.  
 As a result of the termination of the Roche License Agreement, we have regained worldwide exclusive rights from Roche to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize the Compounds, the Products and the Companion Diagnostics in all fields of use.
 30

License Agreement with Merck 
 In December 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Merck (the “Merck License Agreement”) for the development, manufacture and commercialization of ruzasvir.  Ruzasvir is the NS5A inhibitor we are developing in combination with bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of HCV. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merck License Agreement, we obtained from Merck an exclusive (subject to certain reserved rights to conduct internal research), sublicensable, and worldwide license under certain Merck patents and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, export, sell, offer for sale, and otherwise commercialize ruzasvir (the “Compound”), or products containing the Compound (each a “Product”) for all therapeutic or prophylactic uses in humans (the “Field”).
 In consideration for the rights we acquired under the Merck License Agreement, we paid Merck an upfront payment in the amount of $25 million and we will be required to pay Merck milestone payments up to $135 million in the aggregate upon our achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and up to $300 million in the aggregate upon our achievement of certain sales based milestones.  Additionally, we have agreed to pay Merck tiered royalties based on annual net sales of Products ranging from high single digit to mid teens percentages, subject to certain adjustments. Our royalty payment obligations will continue on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed Merck patent claiming such Product (or a Compound contained in such Product) and (ii) a period of years after the first commercial sale of such Product in such country. 
 Under the terms of the Merck License Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one Product in the Field in certain countries. 
 The term of the Merck License Agreement will continue, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, until expiration of all royalty payment obligations arising under the Merck License Agreement.  We may terminate the Merck License Agreement for convenience upon 90 days prior written notice. Each party has the right to terminate the Merck License Agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach of the terms of the Merck License Agreement subject to a 60 day cure period and in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.  Merck has the right to terminate the Merck License Agreement immediately if we commence any interference or opposition proceeding or other challenge to the validity or enforceability of any Merck patent licensed to us under the Merck License Agreement or if we otherwise oppose any extension of, or the grant of any supplementary protection certificate with respect to, any such Merck patent.  
 Upon any termination of the Merck License Agreement, the license granted to us by Merck will terminate. Upon termination of the Merck License Agreement by us for convenience other than as a result of a safety issue, or upon any termination by Merck, Merck will have an exclusive, fully paid, perpetual, sublicensable license to certain of our patents and know-how that are reasonably necessary to develop, manufacture or commercialize a Product that contains ruzasvir as the sole active agent, as such Product exists at termination. Additionally, if requested by Merck, during a period of time after delivery of the notice of termination of the Merck License Agreement by Merck or by us for convenience other than as a result of a safety issue, we will have the obligation to negotiate with Merck for the grant to Merck of a non-exclusive, royalty bearing license to certain of our patents and know-how that are reasonably necessary to develop, manufacture or commercialize a Product that is comprised of the combination of ruzasivir and bemnifosbuvir, as such Product exists at termination, with certain license terms pre-specified in the Merck License Agreement.  
 Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical or clinical product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop or operate our own manufacturing operations in the future. We currently rely upon third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), to produce our product candidates for both preclinical and clinical use. Although we rely on CMOs, we also have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience that can oversee the relationship with our manufacturing partners. We believe that any materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates could be obtained from more than one source.
 31

Competition 
 As a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, we face competition from a wide array of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. These include both small companies and large companies with much greater financial and technical resources and far longer operating histories than our own. We may also compete with the intellectual property, technology, and product development efforts of academic, governmental, and private research institutions.
 Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, marketing, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any product candidates that we develop, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, and may commercialize products more quickly than we are able to.

 The potential treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 continues to evolve. The list above addresses the products or product candidates approved or authorized for emergency use or under clinical development in the United States as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we believe could be the most competitive with a bemnifosbuvir combination therapy, but is not a comprehensive list of every treatment or vaccine that is in development for COVID-19.
Dengue Virus
 In 2019, a vaccine, Dengvaxia® developed by Sanofi Pasteur Inc. (“Sanofi”), was approved by the FDA for the prevention of disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in children ages nine to 16 with laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and living in endemic areas.
 Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd, (“Takeda”), is also advancing a dengue vaccine, TAK-003, which is in Phase 3 development. Primary endpoint analysis of its ongoing Phase 3 trial in children ages four to 16 years showed protection against virologically-confirmed dengue.
 Therapeutics in addition to AT-752 currently in clinical development for the treatment of dengue fever include a dengue NS4B inhibitor being developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies which is in Phase 2a clinical development in adult patients with confirmed dengue fever and a dengue NS4B inhibitor being developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation which is in Phase 1 clinical development. 
 33

HCV
 FDA-approved treatments for patients with chronic HCV include Epclusa® and Vosevi® marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Mavyret®, marketed by AbbVie Inc. We are also aware of an investigational agent for HCV, currently in Phase 2 testing, being developed by Cocrystal Pharma Inc.
RSV
 Supportive care is the most common course of treatment for RSV and includes oxygen, fluid management, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids. Ribavirin, approved in 1986, is used to treat severe cases of RSV infection, but carries significant side effects and risks associated with its use, especially in infants. Synagis® (palivizumab), marketed by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB in the United States and AstraZeneca plc outside of the United States, is an FDA-approved, seasonal monoclonal antibody injection given monthly to help protect high-risk infants from severe RSV. Synagis is not approved as a treatment for RSV.
 There are multiple RSV therapeutic and prophylaxis products in clinical development for the pediatric and adult market segments, with late-stage vaccine candidates from GSK and Pfizer targeting the elderly and maternal populations, late-stage immuno-prophylaxis candidates from AZ and Merck targeting the pediatric population and therapeutic candidates from Janssen and Ark Biopharm targeting the pediatric population.
 At this time, we are aware of investigational agents for the treatment of RSV being developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc., ReViral Ltd, and Ark Biosciences Inc.
 Commercialization
 Given the stage of development of our lead asset, we have not yet invested in a commercial infrastructure or distribution capabilities. We believe that the commercialization of bemnifosbuvir in the United States could be achieved by a small Atea team across sales, marketing, reimbursement and other commercial activities. While we currently plan to establish our own commercial organization in the United States and potentially in other selected markets, we continue to consider and evaluate in each market the potential advantages and enhancements of our commercial capabilities that may be realized as a result of a collaboration between us and a pharmaceutical or other company.
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our nucleotide therapeutic products for viral diseases, including our purine nucleotide compounds for SARS-CoV-2, dengue fever and HCV. We seek to protect our proprietary compounds and methods of treatment for viral diseases using our nucleotide compounds, alone and in combination with other therapeutic agents, in addition to dosage forms, dosing regimens and formulations for their administration. We also seek protection on the manufacturing process for the production of our nucleotide compounds. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our proprietary rights.
 Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. In addition, we currently plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations, and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe and other countries that provide a period of regulatory data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our drug products.
 As of December 31, 2021, we are the sole owner of nine patent families covering our product candidates and proprietary nucleotide compounds, which include composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and processes of manufacture as described in more detail below. Our owned patent estate as of  December 31, 2021, on a worldwide basis, includes more than 180 pending, 
 34

granted, or allowed patent applications with fourteen issued U.S. patents,  ten pending U.S. non-provisional applications, three pending U.S. provisional applications, four pending international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”), and more than 90 pending or granted patent applications that have entered the national phase of prosecution in countries outside the United States.
 As of December 31, 2021, we are the exclusive licensee of three patent families from MSD International GmbH (Merck, Sharp & Dohme Corp.) covering composition of matter, process of preparation, and formulations of the NS5A inhibitor ruzasvir (MK-8408), which collectively include two issued U.S. patents, granted patents in France, Great Britain, and Germany and one pending U.S. patent application and one pending patent application in the EPO. 
 The exclusivity terms of our patents depend upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. The term of a U.S. patent may be extended to compensate for the time required to obtain regulatory approval to sell a drug (a patent term extension) or by delays encountered during patent prosecution that are caused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (referred to as patent term adjustment). For example, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved new chemical entity drugs of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review and diligence during the review process. Patent term extensions in the United States cannot extend the term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent covering an approved drug or its method of use may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved drug, or an approved method for using it may be extended. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 Current issued patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter for our present clinical candidates AT-511, bemnifosbuvir, AT-281 (the free base of AT-752), and AT-752 will expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2038, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged. Current patent applications covering the use of AT-511 and bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 will expire on dates ranging from 2037 to 2041, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged. Current issued patents and patent applications covering the use of AT-511 and bemnifosbuvir for the treatment of HCV will expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2039, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged. Current patent applications covering the use of AT-281 and AT-752 for the treatment of dengue fever will expire on a date in 2037, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged.
 Current patent applications covering the composition of matter for our present HCV combination drug clinical candidate AT-787 will expire on a date in 2039, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged. Current patent applications covering the use of AT-787 for the treatment of HCV will expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2039, if the applications are issued and held valid by a court of final jurisdiction if challenged.
 However, any of our patents, including patents that we may rely on to protect our market for approved products, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction. Alternatively, we may decide that it is in our interest to settle a litigation in a manner that affects the term or enforceability of our patent. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that have been or may be granted on our patents or on third-party patents. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are 
 35

characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to obtain and maintain our proprietary position for our nucleotide compounds and the use of these compounds will depend on our success in enforcing patent claims that have been granted or may grant. We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications that we have filed or may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any additional patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize drugs with similar mechanisms of action and/or duplicate our methods of treatments or strategies without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. For more information regarding risks relating to intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”

 37

We also solely own two provisional applications covering the combination of bemnifosbuvir and ruzasvir, which if granted, will have an expiration date in 2042.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (“NDA”), process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice requirements (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”), requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an IND product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Once submitted, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30- day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all 
 38

research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committee for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.   
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1:    The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects, and in some cases, patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 Phase 2:    The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 Phase 3:    The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. 
 39

The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Process
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once filed, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trials or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations or restrictions on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication 
 40

plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Emergency Use Authorization
 The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) may, under certain circumstances in connection with a declared public health emergency, allow for the marketing of a product that does not otherwise comply with FDA regulations by issuing an EUA for such product. Before an EUA may be issued by HHS, the Secretary must declare an emergency based a determination that public health emergency exists that effects or has the significant potential to affect, national security, and that involves a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents (“CBRN”), or a specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such CBRN. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is such a public health emergency that involves the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection.  Once the determination of the threat or emergency has been made, the Secretary of HHS must then declare that an emergency exists justifying the issuance of EUAs for certain types of products (referred to as EUA declarations).  On March 27, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared – on the basis of his determination of a public health emergency that has the potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad that involves SARS-CoV-2 – that circumstances exist justifying authorization of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any EUA that is issued. 
 Once an EUA declaration has been issued, the FDA can issue EUAs for products that fall within the scope of that declaration.  To issue an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that (1) the CBRN that is referred to in the EUA declaration can cause serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions; (2) based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition attributable to the CBRN and that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks; and (3) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product. Products subject to an EUA must still comply with the conditions of the EUA, including labeling and marketing requirements. Moreover, the authorization to market products under an EUA is limited to the period of time the EUA declaration is in effect, and the FDA can revoke an EUA in certain circumstances.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate 
 41

the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Product candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required clinical trials, or if such trials fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 In 2007, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers (“PRVs”), to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications. The FDA’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for the prevention and treatment of certain tropical diseases affecting millions of people throughout the world. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for the prevention or treatment a tropical disease that meets certain criteria may qualify for a PRV that can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”), for a different product. The sponsor of a topical disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor of an NDA or BLA. The FDCA does not limit the number of times a priority review voucher may be transferred before the voucher is used.
 42

For a product to qualify for a PRV, (i) the sponsor must request approval of the product for the prevention or treatment of a “tropical disease” listed in Section 524 of the FDCA, (ii) the product must otherwise qualify for priority review, and (iii) the product must contain no active ingredient (including any salt or ester of an active ingredient) that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA or BLA. The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 made further changes to the eligibility criteria for receipt of a tropical disease PRV under this program. Specifically, applications submitted after September 30, 2017 must also contain reports of one or more new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the sponsor.
 Post-approval Requirements
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products.
 Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon drug manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | clinical holds on clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies 
 43

actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict marketers’ communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Marketing exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (“505(b)(2) NDA”), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. 
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, pricing reporting, and physician payment transparency laws and regulations regarding drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the United States. Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement fines, additional reporting requirements and oversight obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/ or imprisonment.
 44

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates.
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”) was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for 
 45

Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 There remain judicial and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to health care, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. The likelihood of success of these and other measures initiated by the former Trump administration is uncertain.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Data Privacy & Security 
 Numerous state and federal laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information.  Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Further, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data 
 46

Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover.
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions, such as the European Union, governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization and any commercial sales and distribution of our products once approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, approval process, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
 Similarly to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (“GLP”) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database. 
 While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (“CTA”) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed. 
 The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three 
 47

years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. 
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”). Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorization
 In order to market our future product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a MA application (“MAA”). The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs: 

• | “Centralized MA” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as: (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) designated orphan medicines, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases and (iv) advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”) such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for product candidates containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for product candidates that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. 
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity 
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, reference products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 48

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 The United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. 
 EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. However, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain (“GB”); broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a guidance on how various aspects of the UK regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, importing, exporting, and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development, or commercialization of medicines in the UK. The new guidance was given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Exit Regulations”). 
 The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs. In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures to obtain an MA to commercialize products in the UK.
 There will be no pre-MA orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB, rather than the EU, must not

be more than five in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period of market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB.
