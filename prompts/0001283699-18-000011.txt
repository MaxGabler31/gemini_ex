Business Overview and Strategy
Un-carrier Strategy
We are the Un-carrier. Through our Un-carrier strategy, we’ve disrupted the wireless communications services industry by listening to our customers and providing them with added value and an exceptional experience. We introduced our Un-carrier strategy in 2013 and have since announced 14 signature initiatives that changed the wireless industry forever. We ended annual service contracts, overages, unpredictable international roaming fees, data buckets and more. Customer response to our Un-carrier strategy has allowed T-Mobile to grow into the third largest wireless provider in the United States. We will continue our relentless focus on customers and are determined to bring the Un-carrier to every potential customer in the United States.
Our relentless focus on customer experience through increased investment in customer care, distribution expansion, and digital initiatives has strengthened our customer growth and increased customer retention and satisfaction. We continue to invest and innovate in these areas to deliver our customers the best value in the industry. Everything we do is powered by our nationwide 4G LTE network, and we are rapidly preparing for the next generation of 5G services. Going forward, it is this network that will allow us to deliver innovative new products and services with the same customer focused and industry disrupting mentality that has redefined wireless service in the United States. 
History
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (“VoiceStream”), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (“Western Wireless”). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (“Deutsche Telekom”) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002.
In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc. was formed through the business combination between T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (“MetroPCS”). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA’s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company.
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “TMUS.”
Business
We provide wireless services to 72.6 million customers in the postpaid, prepaid, and wholesale markets and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communication services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses are related to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and MetroPCS, through our owned and operated retail stores, third party distributors and our websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.MetroPCS.com). The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for addition information.
Customers
We provide wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: 

• | Branded postpaid customers generally include customers that are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communication services utilizing phones, mobile broadband devices (including tablets), or DIGITS;

4


• | Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and MetroPCS; and


• | Wholesale customers include Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) and MVNO that operate on our network, but are managed by wholesale partners.

We generate the majority of our service revenues by providing wireless communication services to branded postpaid and branded prepaid customers. Our ability to acquire and retain branded postpaid and prepaid customers is important to our business in the generation of service revenues, equipment revenues and other revenues. In 2017, our service revenues generated by providing wireless communication services by customer category were:

• | 65% Branded postpaid customers;


• | 31% Branded prepaid customers; and


• | 4% Wholesale customers and Roaming and other services.

Segment and Geographic Information
We operate as a single operating segment. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.
All of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were earned in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Services and Products
We provide wireless communication services through a variety of service plan options. We also offer a wide selection of wireless devices, including smartphones, tablets and other mobile communication devices, which are manufactured by various suppliers. Services, devices and accessories are offered directly to consumers through the retail stores we operate, as well as through our websites and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites.
Our primary service plan offerings, which allow customers to subscribe for wireless services separately from the purchase of a device include:

• | Our T-Mobile ONE plan (“T-Mobile ONE”) which gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE data on their device, where monthly wireless service fees and sales taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge. On T-Mobile ONE, video typically streams at DVD (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3G speeds. Customers on T-Mobile ONE can keep their price for service until they decide to change it and participating customers who use 2 GB or less of data in a month will get up to a $10 credit per qualifying line on their next month’s bill. Additionally, qualifying T-Mobile ONE customers on family plans can opt in for a standard monthly Netflix service plan at no additional cost. Customers can choose to add on additional features for an additional cost as follows:


• | On T-Mobile ONE Plus, customers also receive unlimited High Definition video streaming, 10 GB of high-speed 4G LTE tethering, Voicemail to Text, NameID, unlimited Gogo in-flight internet passes on capable domestic flights and up to two times faster speeds when traveling abroad in 140+ countries and destinations.


• | On T-Mobile ONE Plus International, customers receive the benefits of T-Mobile ONE Plus as well as free and reduced calling from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4G LTE tethering.


• | Simple Choice plans, which were launched in 2013 as part of phase 1.0 of our Un-carrier initiatives, eliminated annual service contracts and simplified the lineup of consumer rate plans to one affordable plan for unlimited voice and messaging services with the option to add data services. On January 25, 2017, we streamlined our Simple Choice plan offerings to new customers into our T-Mobile ONE plan.

Depending on their credit profile, customers are qualified either for postpaid or prepaid service.

Our device options for customers on T-Mobile ONE, and previously on Simple Choice plans, include:

• | Depending on their credit profile, qualifying customers who purchase a device from us have the option of financing all or a portion of the purchase price at the time of sale over an installment period of up to 24 months using our Equipment Installment Plan (“EIP”).


• | In addition, qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP can enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!”®) program to later upgrade their device. Upon a qualifying JUMP! upgrade, the customer’s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their used device at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.


• | In 2015, we introduced JUMP! On Demand. With JUMP! On Demand, a low monthly payment covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives qualified customers the freedom to exchange it for a new device up to one time per month for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device. Customers that choose to purchase their device have the option to finance their device over a nine-month EIP.

Network 
The speed and capacity of our LTE network allows us to offer “America’s Best Unlimited Network” to our customers. Our advancements in network technology and our spectrum resources ensure we can continue to increase the breadth and depth of our network as the industry moves towards 5G.
Spectrum Growth
We provide mobile communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum.

• | We owned an average of 110 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2017, comprised of an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 40 MHz in the AWS band. This is compared to an average of 79 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2016.


• | In April 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) announced the results of the broadcast incentive auction which showed that we purchased a nationwide average of 31 MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum for $8.0 billion. This spectrum covered 328 million points of presence (“POPs”) as of December 31, 2017. See Note 5 - Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.


• | As of December 31, 2017, T-Mobile owned approximately 41 MHz of low-band spectrum (600 MHz and 700 MHz), quadruple its pre-auction low-band holdings. The purchased spectrum covers 100% of the U.S.


• | As of December 31, 2017, at least 10 MHz of 600 MHz spectrum covering over 1.2 million square miles and approximately 62 million POPs was clear and available for deployment.


• | T-Mobile has actively engaged with broadcasters to accelerate FCC clearance timelines, entering into approximately 40 agreements with several parties. These agreements will, in aggregate, accelerate clearing, bringing the total clearing target to over 100 million POPs expected by year-end 2018. We expect to reach a clearing target of 250 million POPs by year-end 2019. T-Mobile remains committed to assisting broadcasters occupying 600 MHz spectrum to move to new frequencies.


• | In addition to spectrum clearing, T-Mobile aggressively started deployments of 600 MHz spectrum, lighting up spectrum in 586 cities and towns in 28 states across the country, covering 300,000 square miles as of December 31, 2017.


• | We had two new 600 MHz-capable devices in our retail distribution for the 2017 holiday season (LG V30 and Samsung GS8 Active). We expect more than a dozen new smartphones to be rolled out in 2018 to be 600 MHz-capable.


• | Our 600 MHz spectrum holdings will be used to deploy America's first nationwide 5G network expected by 2020.


• | Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 5 – Goodwill, Spectrum Licenses and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.

• | We intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions.


• | Our wireless infrastructure included approximately 61,000 macro sites and approximately 18,000 distributed antenna system (DAS) and small cell sites as of December 31, 2017.

Network Coverage Growth

• | We continue to expand our coverage breadth and covered 322 million people with 4G LTE as of December 31, 2017.


• | By the end of 2018, we are targeting a population coverage of 325 million and a geographic coverage of 2.5 million square miles.

Network Speed Leadership
As “America’s Best Unlimited Network,” we offer the fastest nationwide 4G LTE upload and download speeds in the United States. The fourth quarter of 2017 is the 16th consecutive quarter we have led the industry in both categories, and this is based on the results of millions of user-generated speed tests.
Network Capacity Growth 
We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 MIMO, 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).

• | VoLTE comprised almost 80% of total voice calls as of December 31, 2017, compared to 64% as of December 31, 2016. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in the rate of VoLTE adoption.


• | Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in over 875 markets. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and performance by bonding multiple discrete spectrum channels together.


• | 4x4 MIMO is currently available in over 475 markets. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed and incremental network capacity to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. We plan to start deploying massive MIMO (FD-MIMO) in selected locations later in 2018.


• | We have rolled out 256 QAM in over 925 markets. 256 QAM increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speed. T-Mobile is the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM.


• | T-Mobile is implementing a significant small cell program. We plan to roll out 25,000 small cells in 2018 and early 2019. This is on top of the approximately 18,000 small cells and DAS nodes already rolled out as of the end of 2017. In conjunction with the small cell rollout, we have also started rolling out License Assisted Access. The first LAA small cell went live in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Distribution
Our network expansion has provided a unique opportunity to grow our distribution footprint by over 30 million POPs from the beginning of 2016 through year-end 2017, bringing our total distribution footprint to over 260 million people. In 2017, we built nearly 1,500 new T-Mobile stores and over 1,300 net new MetroPCS stores. Many of these additional stores are in geographic areas where T-Mobile had not previously competed. In 2017, we opened T-Mobile stores in more than 600 cities and towns where we did not previously have a retail presence.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 20,100 total points of distribution, including approximately 2,200 direct owned stores, 13,300 exclusive third party locations and 4,600 non-exclusive third-party locations as well as distribution through our websites and customer care channels. Our distribution density in major metropolitan areas provides customers with the convenience of having retail and service locations close to where they live and work.
Expansion of our distribution footprint will continue in 2018. In 2018, our retail store expansion will be exclusively focused on Greenfield markets, building on this significant future growth opportunity.

Competition
The wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint”). AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing MVNOs, including TracFone Wireless, Inc. and Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”), and future MVNOs, such as Charter Communications, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 51,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.
Regulation 
The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. 
Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10 years in the case of cellular, PCS and point-to-point microwave licenses. AWS licenses have an initial term of 15 years, with successive 10-year terms thereafter. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 
Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our company by Deutsche Telekom. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on Deutsche Telekom’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement 
8

with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.
While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
