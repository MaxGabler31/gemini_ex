Item 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies. Our two lead product candidates are SNDX-5613 and SNDX-6352, or axatilimab. We are developing SNDX-5613, targeting the binding interaction of menin with the mixed lineage leukemia 1, or MLL1, protein for the treatment of MLL-rearranged, or MLLr, acute leukemias and nucleophosmin 1, or NPM1, mutant acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, as well as axatilimab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the colony stimulating factor 1, or CSF-1 receptor. We have deprioritized the development of entinostat, our once-weekly, oral, small molecule, Class I HDAC inhibitor, to focus resources on advancing our existing pipeline and expanding it with new assets. We plan to continue to leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional therapeutics to expand our pipeline.
Our Strategy 
 Our clinical-stage pipeline includes SNDX-5613, a highly selective inhibitor of the menin–MLL binding interaction, axatilimab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CSF-1 receptor, and entinostat, a Class I HDAC inhibitor.
 We are developing SNDX-5613 in acute leukemias and axatilimab for use in cGVHD and potentially other fibrotic-macrophage driven diseases as single agents and in combination with approved drugs. We have deprioritized the development of entinostat but may opportunistically explore potential disease areas where entinostat could play an important therapeutic role. Key elements of our strategy include: 
  
• | Develop SNDX-5613 for the treatment of genetically defined leukemias. We believe that SNDX-5613 has the potential to treat at least two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) MLLr and (ii) NPM1 AML. Our Phase 1/2 open-label AUGMENT-101 trial is ongoing. We are completing the Phase 1 portion of the trial and have initiated the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial with patients to be enrolled in three indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of SNDX-5613 in MLLr ALL, MLLr AML and NPM1c AML. We are also concurrently expanding into the frontline and maintenance setts with three new trials.

• | Develop axatilimab as a monotherapy in cGVHD. We are conducting the pivotal AGAVE-201 trial for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and are exploring the use of axatilimab to treat other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a role.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage the technical and business expertise of our management team and scientific collaborators to license, acquire and develop additional cancer therapies to expand our pipeline. We have exclusive rights to axatilimab and SNDX-5613. We are continuing to leverage the collective talent within our organization and network of advisors to guide our pipeline expansion and development plans.

Our Pipeline

SNDX-5613
 Our first clinical-stage product candidate, SNDX-5613, is a potent, orally active inhibitor of the high affinity interaction site on menin with the protein MLL1. This specific interaction is a key driver for two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) MLLr and (ii) NPM1c AML. Both diseases have a poor prognosis. In preclinical testing, SNDX-5613 has demonstrated benefit in leukemic models of disease. Initial clinical evidence with SNDX-5613 also supports the hypothesis that disruption of the menin-MLL interaction can lead to responses in acute leukemias.

We are developing SNDX-5613 as a targeted therapy to potentially treat two genetically defined acute leukemias: (i) a genetically defined subset of acute leukemias with chromosomal rearrangements in the mixed lineage leukemia gene, known as MLLr; and (ii) AML, with a somatic mutation in the nucleophosmin 1, or NPM1, gene, also known as NPM1c. Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish proof-of-concept that SNDX-5613 is a targeted therapy that can potentially provide meaningful clinical benefit to adult and pediatric leukemia patients having relapsed or refractory MLLr or NPM1c acute leukemias. Our investigational new drug, or IND, application for SNDX-5613 took effect with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the second quarter of 2019 and we commenced AUGMENT-101, a clinical trial consisting initially of a Phase 1 dose escalation portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and recommended Phase 2 dose of SNDX-5613 in patients with acute leukemia. We are conducting the trial at multiple centers in the United States. We are completing the Phase 1 portion of the trial and have initiated the pivotal Phase 2 portion of the trial with patients to be enrolled in three 
 2


indication-specific expansion cohorts to determine the efficacy, short- and long-term safety, and tolerability of SNDX-5613 in MLLr ALL, MLLr AML and NPM1c AML.
 In September 2021, we participated in a meeting with the FDA to discuss the results of the Phase 1 portion of our AUGMENT-101 trial. At the meeting, the FDA agreed with our recommended Phase 2 dose and confirmed that we may initiate the Phase 2 registration-directed cohorts of AUGMENT-101. Additionally, the FDA agreed with our proposed statistical design and endpoints for each of the three Phase 2 expansion cohorts.
 Additionally, we announced that we will initiate a frontline trial of SNDX-5613 in combination with venetoclax and azacytidine in newly diagnosed AML patients unable to tolerate induction chemotherapy. The trial will be conducted as part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Beat AML Master Clinical Trial, and SNDX-5613 is the first menin inhibitor to be included in the Beat AML Master Clinical Trial. We also announced that we will initiate a trial to assess the anti-leukemic efficacy of SNDX-5613 in MLLr or NPM1 patients with measurable residual disease progression following anti-leukemic treatment. This trial will be conducted as part of the Australian Leukemia and Lymphoma Group INTERCEPT Master Clinical Trial, a collaborative clinical trial investigating novel therapies to target early relapse and clonal evolution as pre-emptive therapy in AML. SNDX-5613 is the first menin inhibitor to be included in the INTERCEPT AML Master Clinical Trial. Lastly, we announced that we will initiate a new trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-leukemic efficacy of SNDX-5613 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory MLLr or mNPM1 acute leukemias. We expect that the Phase 1b trial, which we refer to as AUGMENT-102, will enroll up to 27 patients.
 In December 2021, we presented positive date from the Phase 1 portion of our AUGMENT-101 trial in heavily pretreated patients with MLLr or NPM1c mutations in an oral presentation during the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Virtual Annual Meeting. The following table summarizes select efficacy and safety data that has been presented by us throughout 2021.

* Overall Response Rate = CR + CRh + CRp + CRi + MLFS
 In the data that we presented at ASH, SNDX-5613 was well tolerated, with no discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events observed. The only dose limiting toxicity observed was Grade 3 QT prolongation, which occurred in 7% (n=3/43) of patients treated at the four doses that met the study’s pre-defined recommended Phase 2 dose criteria.
 In January 2020, the FDA granted SNDX-5613 Orphan Drug Designation, or ODD, for the treatment of adult and pediatric AML and in June 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation to SNDX-5613 for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias harboring a MLLr or NPM1 mutation. In December 2021, we announced that the European Commission granted ODD to SNDX-5613 for the treatment of AML.
 SNDX-5613
 Rationale for Targeting MLLr
 3


MLLr leukemias arise by rare, spontaneous translocations at the MLL1 locus (11q23). It is estimated that approximately 10% of AML and ALL harbor this MLL-re-arrangement with a worldwide incidence of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 cases per year. These translocations generate oncogenic fusion proteins with more than 90 different MLL fusions currently known. All MLL fusion proteins bind with high affinity to the chromatin associated protein menin through a conserved N-terminal sequence. This specific interaction with menin enables an aberrant transcription program that drives leukemic transformation. In pre-clinical animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple leukemic xenografts harboring MLL fusions. Inhibiting the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of MLLr leukemias. Today, the first choice therapy for both MLLr AML and MLLr ALL still relies heavily on intensive chemotherapy, if a patient can tolerate such treatment. Despite these patients being routinely diagnosed, there are currently no targeted therapies approved to treat patients with MLLr acute leukemias. Currently there are several other clinical-stage menin-inhibitors in development for the treatment of MLLr AML and MLLr ALL.

Rationale for Targeting Nucleophosmin 1 Mutant AML
 NPM1 is among the most frequently mutated genes in AML, found in approximately 30% of AML cases for an incidence of approximately 20,000 cases per year. Mutations in NPM1 lead to the aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the mutants, termed NPM1c. Loss of NPM1c from the nucleus leads to suppression of differentiation and enables a leukemic transcription program that relies critically on the menin-MLL1 complex to drive and maintain the program. As a result, NPM1c harboring cells are sensitive to menin-MLL interaction inhibitors. In NPM1c cells, inhibition of the menin-MLL interaction suppresses the leukemic transcription program, causing growth arrest, terminal differentiation and cell death. In animal models, small molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction have demonstrated deep and durable single agent treatment effects in multiple NPM1c xenografts. Based on these findings, blocking the menin-MLL1 interaction represents a novel targeted strategy for the treatment of NPM1c AML.
 Like MLLr, NPM1 is readily diagnosed as part of the standard AML patient work-up today, and yet there are no approved targeted therapies approved to treat patients with a NPM1 mutant AML. There are several additional clinical stage agents currently advancing as potential treatments for NPM1 mutant AML. 
 Axatilimab
 We are also developing axatilimab a monoclonal antibody targeting the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, or CSF-1R, a cell surface protein thought to control the survival and function of monocytes and macrophages. Axatilimab binds with high affinity to CSF-1R and blocks the binding of the two known CSF-1R ligands CSF-1 and IL-34. CSF-1R is expressed on the surface of specific immune cells known as macrophages and their precursor cells known as monocytes. CSF-1R signaling on these cells has been demonstrated in preclinical studies conducted in animal models of skin and lung chronic graft versus host disease, or cGVHD, to be the key regulatory pathway involved in the expansion and infiltration of the macrophages that mediate fibrosis and the cGVHD disease process. Blocking CSF-1R activity with an experimental CSF-1R antibody in these studies was shown to prevent and treat the symptoms of cGVHD. We believe that by inhibiting CSF-1R activation on monocytes and macrophages, axatilimab has the potential to be used to treat cGVHD as well as other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a significant role.

Our near-term focus is to rapidly establish that axatilimab can provide meaningful clinical benefit in patients with advanced cGVHD where prior therapies are no longer effective and to establish proof-of-concept of using axatilimab to treat other fibrotic diseases where monocyte-derived macrophages have been shown to play a role.
 We announced that following our end of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA, we have aligned on a regulatory path for axatilimab for the treatment of cGVHD. We commenced a pivotal Phase 2 trial, AGAVE-201, to assess the safety and efficacy of different doses and schedules of axatilimab for the treatment of patients with cGVHD. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate based on the 2014 NIH consensus criteria for GVHD with key secondary endpoints including duration of response and improvement in modified Lee Symptom Scale score. We anticipate releasing topline data in 2023. We completed enrollment of the Phase 1/2 trial evaluating axatilimab for the treatment of patients with cGVHD in the second quarter of 2021. 
 In December 2021, we presented positive data from the Phase 1/2 trial of axatilimab in patients with recurrent or refractory chronic cGVHD despite two or more prior lines of therapy in an oral presentation during the American Society of Hematology at ASH. During the presentation, and in a press release that we issued on the presentation date, we shared that as of October 22, 2021 (data cutoff) a total of 40 patients were treated in the SNDX-6352-503 trial, who received a median of four prior systemic therapies. There were 31 evaluable patients treated at 1mg/kg every 2 weeks or 3mg/kg every 4 weeks, the doses that we are testing in the ongoing AGAVE-201 global pivotal study. Of the evaluable patients, responses were observed in 68% (n=21/31) of patients, with a best ORR (complete response (CR) plus partial response) of 72% (n=18/25) at 1mg/kg every two weeks and 50% (n=3/6) at 3mg/kg every four weeks. Responses observed across a range of organ systems with difficult to treat manifestations such as lung (n=5/15), skin (n=3/28), and joints and fascia (n=16/24). Fifty-three percent of patients (n=16/30) reported clinically meaningful improvement as measured by at least a 7-point decrease in Lee Symptom Scale score. As of data cutoff 43% (n=17/40) of patients remained on treatment.
 In the data that we presented at ASH, axatilimab was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. The most common observed adverse events were consistent with on-target effects on liver enzyme pharmacology. There was no incidence of cytomegalovirus or other viral reactivation and no apparent increases in risk for infection. Enrollment remains ongoing in the global pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD, with topline data expected in 2023.
 In March and April of 2021, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to axatilimab for the treatment of patients with cGVHD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. In addition to the ongoing AGAVE-201 trial, we and Incyte expect to initiate additional trials of axatilimab in patients with cGVHD in 2022, including a Phase 2 trial in combination with a JAK inhibitor in patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD. Beyond cGVHD, we plan to commence a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of axatilimab in the first half of 2022 in patients with IPF.

Axatilimab in GVHD
 cGVHD, an immune response of the donor-derived hematopoietic cells against recipient tissues, is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, that can last for years. cGVHD is estimated to develop in approximately 40% of transplant recipients and affects approximately 14,000 patients in the United States. cGVHD typically manifests across multiple organ systems, with the skin and mucosa being commonly involved, and is characterized by the development of fibrotic tissue 
 The first line of therapy for cGVHD is typically corticosteroids, though approximately 50% of patients may require treatment with additional systemic therapies, such as extracorporeal photopheresis, cytostatic agents such as mycophenolate moftetil, methotrexate, and immunmodulators such as rituximab, IL-2. Imbruvica® (ibrutinib), a BTK inhibitor, was the first FDA-approved therapy for cGVHD and is indicated for use after one or more lines of therapy. Imbruvica received approval based on Phase 1/2 clinical trial data that showed a 68% overall response rate, with 48% of responses lasting 20 weeks or longer and reduced dependence on steroids for most patients. While approved agents have shown a benefit in improving symptoms of this disease, none have demonstrated an improvement in long-term outcomes and a significant unmet medical need still remains for this patient population. Additionally, all currently approved agents are believed to exert their effect through T- and B-cells, with minimal impact on macrophages. By inhibiting the work of monocyte-derived macrophages, Axatilimab, provides a differentiated way to treat cGVHD, which we expect is ultimately expected to have a more pronounced impact on the fibrotic process. We also believe that shifting CSF-1R inhibition earlier in the treatment phase of cGVHD, to minimize formation of fibrotic tissue, could have a meaningful long-term impact on the disease process itself. 
 Entinostat 
 Entinostat is our oral, small molecule product candidate that has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, potentially enhancing the body’s immune response to tumors. In May 2020, we reported final results of E2112, the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, that evaluated the investigational compound entinostat plus exemestane in patients with advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HR+, HER2-) breast cancer. The trial did not achieve the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant overall survival benefit over hormone therapy alone. 
 We have deprioritized the development of entinostat, but may opportunistically explore potential disease areas where entinostat could play an important therapeutic role.
 Collaborations
 Incyte Collaboration and License Agreement
 In September 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Incyte Agreement, with Incyte for the development and commercialization of axatilimab. Additionally, in September 2021 the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Incyte, or Incyte Share Purchase Agreement. Collectively referred to as the Incyte Agreements. Under the terms of the Incyte Agreement, Incyte received exclusive commercialization rights outside of the United States, and we and Incyte will, subject to the exercise of our co-promotion option, have co-commercialization rights in the United States, with respect to axatilimab. Incyte is responsible for leading commercialization strategy and booking all revenue from worldwide sales of axatilimab, subject to its royalty payment obligations set forth below. The parties will share equally the profits and losses from the co-commercialization efforts. We and Incyte are co-developing axatilimab and sharing development costs associated with global and U.S.-specific clinical trials, with Incyte responsible for 55% of such costs and we are responsible for 45% of such costs. Each company is responsible for funding any independent development activities. All development costs related to the collaboration are subject to a joint development plan. A joint development committee between us and Incyte will govern future development of axatilimab. 
 In addition, we and Incyte entered into a Letter Agreement memorializing how the parties would work together in the event that the government intervened in the proposed collaboration and the parties are forced to terminate and unwind the collaboration. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the parties agreed, in part, (i) to permit Incyte to terminate the Incyte Agreement through September 2022 if, prior to March 23, 2022, either party for the 
 6


first time receives a formal request from either the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, regarding the Incyte Agreement, which we refer to as the Termination Right, and (ii) to provide the parties with a mechanism to settle any gain or loss related to Incyte’s equity investment in the Company solely in the event that Incyte exercises its Termination Right. If Incyte exercises its Termination Right, (x) we will refund to Incyte the $117 million upfront license fee and any payments made by Incyte for royalties, milestones and development costs and any other amounts paid by Incyte to us under the Incyte Agreement, and (y) we will waive any remaining lock-up restrictions and Incyte may sell may the shares of our common stock that it purchased in connection with its equity investment pursuant to the Incyte Agreement. Following a sale of its shares, Incyte will remit to us any gain that it received, or, alternatively, we will repay Incyte for any loss that it incurred in each case in connection with the sale of the shares. The Termination Right expires if the parties do not receive a formal request before March 23, 2022. To date, the parties have not received any formal request from either the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, Antitrust Division.
Upon signing the Letter Agreement in December 2021 both the Incyte Agreement and Incyte Share Purchase Agreement became effective. As a result, we received an upfront fee of $117 million and we issued 1,421,523 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35 million, or $24.62 per share. We are eligible to receive up to $230 million in commercialization milestones as well as tiered royalties ranging in the mid-teens on sales outside of the United States. 
 NCI and Investigator Collaborations 
 Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Entinostat 
 Our collaboration with the NCI is governed by a CRADA between us and the NCI. The CRADA was originally signed by Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Mitsui, and was then assigned to Schering AG following Schering AG’s acquisition of Mitsui. In 2007, Schering AG, then known as Bayer Schering Pharma AG, agreed to assign the CRADA to us in connection with the execution of a license, development and commercialization agreement, or the Bayer license agreement, with Bayer. 
 Under the CRADA, as amended, the NCI sponsors clinical studies on entinostat using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions, including ECOG-ACRIN and JHU. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these clinical studies, and we are obligated to supply the clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other clinical trial. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA. 
 We own any intellectual property generated in the course of the collaboration with the NCI, or Collaboration IP, to the extent that Collaboration IP is generated by our employees. We also have an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license under Collaboration IP generated by the NCI. With respect to any Collaboration IP that is owned by or licensed to us, we have agreed to grant the United States government a non-exclusive license to practice or have practiced this Collaboration IP throughout the world by or on behalf of the government for research or other government purposes. 
 Either party may terminate the CRADA either by mutual consent or unilaterally upon advance written notice to the other party. Absent such early termination, the CRADA will expire on May 21, 2023. As we have in the past, we expect to renew the CRADA at that time. 
 Collaborative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI related to Axatilimab and Entinostat
 In September 2016, we entered into an additional collaboration with the NCI related to both entinostat and axatilimab. Under the CRADA, the NCI sponsors preclinical and clinical studies on entinostat and axatilimab using researchers at the NCI as well as NCI-funded researchers at other institutions. In return, we receive access to the data generated in these preclinical and clinical studies and we are obligated to supply the laboratories and clinical trial sites with sufficient quantities of entinostat and axatilimab. Additionally, we are required to make an annual payment to a particular NCI laboratory to help support certain research studies related to this and other preclinical and clinical trials. We have no other payment obligations under the CRADA.

In June 2019, we achieved certain development and regulatory milestones resulting in a $4.0 million payment, which was paid with interest in May 2020. In January 2022, we dosed the first patient in our pivotal phase 2 study, consequently completing our phase 1 study. Completion of the phase 1 study requires us to pay AbbVie a $2.0 million development milestone. We anticipate paying this milestone in the first quarter of 2022.
 Each party may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to Vitae. Vitae may terminate the AbbVie License Agreement if we or any of its affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the AbbVie License Agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 UCB 
 We have a license agreement with UCB, or the UCB license agreement, under which UCB granted us a worldwide, sublicenseable, exclusive license to UCB6352, which the Company refers to as axatilimab. The UCB license agreement permits us to use axatilimab or other licensed products for all human uses, including treatment, prevention and diagnostic uses, in all indications, diseases, conditions or disorders, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize a certain licensed product. We are solely responsible for the development and commercialization of axatilimab.
 Subject to the achievement of certain milestone events, we may be required to pay UCB up to $119.5 million in one-time development and regulatory milestone payments over the term of the UCB license agreement. In the event that we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees commercializes axatilimab, we will also be obligated to pay UCB low double-digit royalties on sales, subject to reduction in certain circumstances, as well as up to an aggregate of $250.0 million in potential one-time, sales-based milestone payments based on achievement of certain annual sales thresholds. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to share a percentage of non-royalty income from sublicensees, subject to certain deductions, with UCB. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we were required to pay $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, due to the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2021, $2.0 million is recorded as an accrued expense.

Each party may terminate the UCB license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency; and we may terminate the UCB license agreement at will at any time upon advance written notice to UCB. UCB may terminate the UCB license agreement if we or any of our affiliates or sublicensees institutes a legal challenge to the validity, enforceability, or patentability of the licensed patent rights. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the UCB license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of: (i) the expiration of all of the licensed patent rights in such country; (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity applicable to the product in such country; and (iii) 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. 
 Bayer Pharma AG
 We have a license agreement with Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer, pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize entinostat and any other products containing the same active ingredient. The Bayer license agreement, as amended, permits us to use entinostat or other licensed products for the treatment of any human disease, and we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize licensed products for all commercially reasonable indications. Initially, Bayer manufactured and supplied our requirements of entinostat, but effective May 2012, manufacturing rights and responsibility for entinostat was transferred to us, by mutual agreement of the parties. 
 We are obligated to pay up to approximately $50.0 million in the aggregate upon obtaining certain milestones in the development and marketing approval of entinostat, assuming that we pursue at least two different indications for entinostat or any other licensed product. We are also obligated to pay Bayer up to $100.0 million in aggregate sales milestones, and a tiered single-digit royalty on net sales by us, our affiliates and sublicensees of entinostat and any other licensed products under the Bayer license agreement. We are obligated to pay Bayer these royalties on a country-by-country basis for the life of the relevant licensed patents covering such product or 15 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country, whichever is longer. We cannot determine the date on which our royalty payment obligations to Bayer would expire because no commercial sales of entinostat have occurred and the last-to-expire relevant patent covering entinostat in a given country may change in the future. 
 The Bayer license agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of our royalty obligations under the agreement in all countries. Upon expiration of the agreement our licenses become fully paid-up and irrevocable. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement in its entirety or with respect to certain countries in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. Either party may terminate the Bayer license agreement if voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings are instituted against the other party, if the other party makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or upon the occurrence of other specific events relating to the insolvency or dissolution of the other party. Bayer may terminate the Bayer license agreement if we seek to revoke or challenge the validity of any patent licensed to us by Bayer under the Bayer license agreement or if we procure or assist a third party to take any such action. 
 Eddingpharm International Company Limited
 We have a license, development and commercialization agreement with Eddingpharm International Company Limited, or Eddingpharm, under which we granted Eddingpharm an exclusive license under our intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize entinostat in China and certain other Asian countries. This license includes a sublicense under the rights we received under the Bayer license agreement. If we acquire or develop any other anti-cancer drug that, like entinostat, is a selective inhibitor of Class I HDAC, such drug will be included in this license as well. Eddingpharm is manufacturing entinostat during the term of the agreement or through termination of the agreement for our breach. During the term of the agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each party is prohibited from commercializing in China and certain other Asian countries any other selective inhibitor of Class I HDACs for the same indication as entinostat, with all forms of cancer being treated as the same indication.
 We are eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments as well as royalty payments based on revenue targets. Royalty payment obligations will be payable in each country in the Eddingpharm territory until the later to occur of (i) the date that all valid claims of the last effective license patent in such country expires or is abandoned, withheld or otherwise invalidated and (ii) 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of entinostat in such country. Any payments owed to Bayer as a result of Eddingpharm’s 
 9


development of entinostat in the Eddingpharm territory will be made by us out of the payments we receive from Eddingpharm.
 The agreement with Eddingpharm will expire with respect to each country in the Eddingpharm territory upon the expiration of all royalty payment obligations in such country. In addition, we may terminate the agreement in its entirety upon written notice to Eddingpharm if Eddingpharm or any affiliate commences any action or proceeding that challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent in the Eddingpharm territory. Eddingpharm may terminate the agreement in its entirety for convenience at any time upon advance notice to us. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, or bankruptcy or related actions or proceedings. If we commit an uncured material breach of certain provisions of the agreement, Eddingpharm may, instead of terminating the agreement, elect to continue the agreement in full force and effect except certain payments to us will be reduced.
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our product candidates in the United States. Our targeted sales force will focus on a well-defined group of medical oncologists, primarily in the non-hospital and academic settings, who are responsible for the care and treatment of cancer patients. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we would also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to rely on our current partners and may seek additional pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of axatilimab, SNDX-5613 or entinostat, and we do not have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have any current contractual relationship for the manufacture of commercial supplies. If axatilimab, SNDX-5613 or entinostat is approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of such product. Development and commercial quantities of any products that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. 
Intellectual Property
 Patents and Property Rights
 Through licensed intellectual property and our owned intellectual property, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, as well as for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad claiming our proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 10


We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us or our licensors in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing owned or licensed patents or any patents that may be granted to us or to our licensors in the future will protect our technology. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies that we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties, and prevent third parties from infringing our proprietary rights. 
 Axatilimab Patent Portfolio
 We in-licensed from UCB a patent portfolio directed to axatilimab. As of December 31, 2021, the axatilimab composition-of-matter patent portfolio included two granted U.S. patents, seven allowed non-U.S. applications, fourteen granted non-U.S. patents, including a granted EP patent which has been validated in 37 countries, and 19 non-U.S. pending patent applications. The in-licensed granted patents covering axatilimab, and any non-U.S. pending applications should they issue, will expire in August 2034 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 Our in-licensed patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications directed to methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of fibrotic disease by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, methods for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity, and liquid pharmaceutical compositions of anti-CSF-1R antibodies. If these pending applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between November 2024 and February 2036 or later should patent term extension be granted. Further, the in-licensed portfolio includes three non-U.S. patents directed to methods of treating solid tumors by administration of an inhibitor of CSF-1R activity. The three patents expired in October 2020.
 Our owned axatilimab patent portfolio includes one pending U.S. patent application and six non-U.S. patent application directed to combinations of entinostat and axatilimab. If any one of these applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire in May 2038 or later should patent term extension be granted. Our owned axatilimab patent portfolio also consists of one pending international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, directed to the treatment regimens and methods of using axatilimab. If this PCT application were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire in December 2040 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 Menin Asset Patent Portfolio
 We in-licensed from Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of AbbVie plc, a patent portfolio directed to a series of selective preclinical inhibitors targeting the binding interaction of menin with MLL-r. As of December 31, 2021, the in-licensed portfolio includes two granted U.S. patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 10,683,302 and 10,899,758, six granted non-U.S patents, including a granted European patent, which was validated in 30 member states, two pending U.S. applications and 28 non-U.S. pending patent applications covering composition of matter and methods of treating, e.g., MLL. The granted patents based on the in-licensed applications is expected to expire June 2037 or later should patent term extension be granted. If the in-licensed application were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between June 2037 and September 2037.
 Our owned menin patent portfolio consists of one pending international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, directed to combinations of a menin inhibitor and a CYP3A inhibitor for the treatment of various cancers.  Our owned menin patent portfolio also consists of two U.S. provisional applications directed to menin inhibitors and combinations with various other compounds. If any applications arising from the PCT or provisional applications were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between April 2041 and May 2042 or later should patent term extension be granted.
 Entinostat Patent Portfolio
 We strive to protect entinostat with multiple layers of patents. As of December 31, 2021, our portfolio included four owned pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, one owned granted U.S. patent, U.S. Patent No. 10,226,472, which expires in August 2032 or later should patent term extension be granted, one allowed U.S. non-provisional patent application directed to methods of treating a patient with combinations of entinostat and 
 11


pembrolizumab, eight granted non-U.S. patents (including one Canadian patent jointly owned with The Regents of the University of Colorado, which will expire in April 2029), and 49 owned non-U.S. pending patent applications. Also, we have filed national phase applications in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office, Ukraine and Georgia based on our owned PCT application directed to treatment of selected breast cancer patients with a combination of entinostat and exemestane. We have assigned our rights to the application we filed in the Eurasia Regional Patent Office to Domain Russia Investments Limited, or DRI. We have also assigned our rights to the applications we filed in Ukraine and Georgia to NovaMedica LLC, or NovaMedica. Our owned entinostat patent portfolio includes pending U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat and exemestane, methods of treating cancer patients by administration of entinostat in combination with an HER2 inhibitor, treatments with entinostat combined with anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibodies, entinostat and CSF-1 or CSF-1R combination therapies (also discussed above in the Axatilimab Patent Portfolio) and patient selection for combination therapy comprising entinostat and a second therapeutic agent. If our owned pending U.S. applications and non-U.S. filings were to issue as one or more patents, these patents would expire between August 2032 and May 2039. 
 The patent portfolio we licensed from Bayer contains a number of issued U.S. and foreign patents as well as patent applications pending outside the United States. A number of the patents and patent applications we licensed from Bayer are directed to entinostat while other patents and patent applications are directed to compounds other than entinostat. As of December 31, 2019, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer included seven issued U.S. patents, 62 granted non-U.S. patents and 17 patent applications pending in non-U.S. patent offices. For example, the portfolio we licensed from Bayer includes reissue U.S. Patent RE39,754, which covers a genus of benzamide compounds including entinostat or SNDX-275. RE39,754 is a composition of matter patent having an initial term which expired in September 2017. 
 The portfolio we licensed from Bayer also includes U.S. Patent 7,973,166, or the ’166 patent, which covers a crystalline polymorph of entinostat which is referred to as crystalline polymorph B, the crystalline polymorph used in the clinical development of entinostat. Many compounds can exist in different crystalline forms. A compound which in the solid state may exhibit multiple different crystalline forms is called polymorphic, and each crystalline form of the same chemical compound is termed a polymorph. A new crystalline form of a compound may arise, for example, due to a change in the chemical process or the introduction of an impurity. Such new crystalline forms may be patented. By comparison, the U.S. Patent RE39,754, which expired in September 2017, covers the chemical entity of entinostat and any crystalline or non-crystalline form of entinostat. On March 7, 2014, our licensor Bayer applied for reissue of the ‘166 patent. The reissue application sought to add three additional inventors to the ‘166 patent. The reissue was granted as RE45,499 on April 28, 2015, at which time the original ‘166 patent was surrendered. The reissue patent has the same force and effect as the original ‘166 patent and the same August 2029 expiration date. 
 Of the unexpired foreign-granted patents we licensed from Bayer, there are 33 granted foreign counterparts of the ‘166 patent (now RE45,499) that cover crystalline polymorph B, including the European patent and Eurasian patent. The granted European patent comprises 37 national countries that have all been validated, and the granted Eurasian patent comprises nine countries that have all been validated. Likewise, there are 3 pending foreign counterparts of the ‘166 crystalline polymorph B patent. Other patents and patent applications in the licensed Bayer portfolio are expired and cover methods of treatment by administration of entinostat. For example, U.S. Patent 7,317,028, which expired in October 2017, covers methods of treating selected cancers by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 7,687,525, which also expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating autoimmune disease by administration of entinostat; U.S. Patent 6,320,078, which expired in July 2019, covers methods of manufacturing entinostat; U.S. Patent No. 8,026,239, which expired in September 2017, covers methods of treating certain malignant tumors by administration of a compound within a subgenus of benzamide compounds including entinostat; U.S. Patent RE40,703, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat; and U.S. Patent 6,794,392, which expired in September 2017, covers a subgenus of benzamide compounds that does not include entinostat.

Patent Term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the earliest non-provisional application or PCT application. 
 In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and regulatory review process. To obtain a patent extension in the United States, the term of the relevant patent must not have expired before the extension application, the patent cannot have been extended previously under this law, an application for extension must be submitted, the product must be subject to regulatory review prior to its commercialization, and the permission for the commercial marketing or use of the product after such regulatory review period is the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. If our future products contain active ingredients which have not been previously approved, we may be eligible for a patent term extension in the United States. In the United States, we expect to seek extension of patent terms under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent for patent claims covering a new chemical entity. If patent extensions are available to us outside of the United States, we would expect to file for a patent term extension in applicable jurisdictions.
 Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements 
 We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. 
 In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting and service agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 United States Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements upon, among other things, the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, purity, potency, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping and reporting, approval, import and export, advertising and promotion, and postmarket surveillance of drugs and biologics. 
Biopharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 The process required by the FDA before biopharmaceutical products may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of an IND application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use or uses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for biologics;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the application for filing and review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of an NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biopharmaceutical product in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety, toxicity profile and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. A sponsor must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA within the 30-day time period raises concerns or questions about the submitted data or the conduct of the proposed clinical trial and places the IND on clinical hold. In such case, the IND application sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. A separate submission to the existing IND application must be made for each successive clinical trial to be conducted during product development. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and informed consent for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. Informed consent must also be obtained from each study subject. Regulatory authorities, an IRB, a data safety monitoring board or the trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 
  
• | Phase 1—The drug is initially given to healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk ratio of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues. 
 Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring board or committee. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 14


Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include developed methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the finished product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 FDA Review and Approval Processes 
 In order to obtain approval to market a biopharmaceutical product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug for the proposed indication. Each NDA or BLA submission requires a substantial user fee payment unless a waiver or exemption applies. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. 
 The FDA will initially review an NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an application to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. After an NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Upon the filing of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant a priority review designation to a product, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at 6 months, rather than the standard 10 months. Priority review is given for drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation does not change the scientific or medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of an NDA or BLA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the product is approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the application will not be approved in its current form and inform the sponsor of changes that must be made or additional clinical, nonclinical or manufacturing data that must be received before the application can be approved.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or might contain significant limitations on use in the form of warnings, precautions or contraindications, or in the form of onerous risk management plans, restrictions on distribution, or post-marketing study requirements. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to 
 15


monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of an NDA must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve an NDA without an approved REMS, if required. 
 Expedited Review Programs 
 Among other programs, the FDA may expedite the review of a product candidate designated as a breakthrough therapy, which is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a drug as a breakthrough therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND application for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The FDA may rescind a breakthrough therapy designation in the future if further clinical development later shows that the criteria for designation are no longer met. 
 Breakthrough therapy designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 If and when approved, any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences and submitting annual reports.
 Biopharmaceutical manufacturers are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports to have. The FDA and certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, fail to approve any application, shut down manufacturing operations or withdraw approval of an application, or we may recall the product from distribution. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures and injunctive action. 
 The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. While doctors are free to prescribe any drug approved by the FDA for any use based on the doctor’s independent medical judgement, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to actively market a drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. Government regulators recently have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs. 
 16


Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement to healthcare providers from third-party payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are available. Assuming coverage is granted, the reimbursement rates paid for covered products might not be adequate. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement to allow us to sell such products on a competitive and profitable basis. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer such products, and patients may decline to purchase them. This, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success. 
 In the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies. Such pressure, along with the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union, will likely put additional downward pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions, governmental laws and regulations related to government healthcare programs, healthcare reform, and pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies. 
 The market for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on the degree to which these products are listed on third-party payors’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement to the extent products for which we may receive regulatory approval are covered under a pharmacy benefit or are otherwise subject to a formulary. The industry competition to be included on such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results.

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The Affordable Care Act provides, and recent government cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers support, the view that federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may implicate the False Claims Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may also be subject to federal and state laws that govern the privacy and security of other personal information, including federal and state consumer protection laws, state data security laws, and data breach notification laws. A data breach affecting sensitive personal information, including health information, could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge, investigation or legal action under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 To the extent that any of our product candidates receive approval and are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, international data protection laws (including the General Data Protection Directive ((EU) 2016/679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data as well as EU member state implementing legislation), and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our business, including, without limitation, our ability to commercialize, and the prices we may obtain for, any of our product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following: 

• | an annual, nondeductible fee payable by any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of- sale discounts off negotiated prices;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and

• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On December 27, 2021, CMS issued a final rule that rescinded an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk 
 20


purchasing. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain but may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our products once commercialized. 
 Regulations Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
Other Regulations 
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of February 25, 2022, we had 59 full-time employees. Of the full-time employees, 41 were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 15 have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 Compensation and Benefits
 We consider a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee engagement, development, and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee safety and wellness, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with salaries and bonuses intended to be competitive for our industry, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust benefits package to promote well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we have conducted employee surveys to gauge employee engagement and identify areas of future focus for our human capital practices and benefits offerings.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
 We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success and we are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws.  We understand that varied perspectives lead to the best ideas and outcomes. We believe that by creating a workplace where every individual can feel welcome and valued, we will be better able 
 21


to achieve our corporate objectives. All employees must adhere to a code of business conduct and ethics and our employee handbook, which combined, define standards for appropriate behavior and are annually trained to help prevent, identify, report, and stop any type of discrimination and harassment. Our recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation, and advancement is based on qualifications, performance, skills, and experience without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity.
