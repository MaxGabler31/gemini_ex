Unless otherwise specified, references to "Brookdale," "we," "us," "our" or "the Company" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean Brookdale Senior Living Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
Our Business
As of December 31, 2017, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 1,023 communities in 46 states and the ability to serve approximately 101,000 residents. We offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry. We operate independent living, assisted living and dementia-care communities and continuing care retirement centers ("CCRCs"). Through our ancillary services programs, we also offer a range of home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities.
As of December 31, 2017, we owned or leased 794 communities (66,641 units) and provided management services with respect to 229 communities (33,941 units) for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest. As of such date, we operated 129 retirement center communities (24,476 units), 822 assisted living communities (56,718 units) and 72 CCRCs (19,388 units).  The majority of our units are located in campus settings or communities containing multiple services, including CCRCs.  As of December 31, 2017, our ancillary services platform included networks in 28 states with the ability to provide home health services to 63.7% of our units, hospice services to 21.7% of our units, and outpatient therapy to 17.0% of our units. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated 82.1% of our resident fee revenues from private pay customers and 15.2% from government reimbursement programs (primarily Medicare). For the year ended December 31, 2017, 39.5% of our resident and management fee revenues were generated from owned communities, 46.9% from leased communities, 11.6% from our ancillary services business and 2.0% from communities we operate on behalf of third parties or unconsolidated ventures.
We believe that we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry, and our goal is to be the first choice in senior living by being the nation’s most trusted and effective senior living provider and employer. Our community and service offerings combine housing, health care, hospitality and ancillary services. Our senior living communities offer residents a supportive home-like setting, assistance with activities of daily living ("ADL") such as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting and transferring/walking and, in certain communities, licensed skilled nursing services. We also provide ancillary services, including home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. By providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change, we provide greater continuity of care, enabling seniors to "age-in-place," which we believe enables them to maintain residency with us for a longer period of time. The ability of residents to age-in-place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives. With our platform of a range of community and service offerings, we believe that we are positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends over time.
Leadership and Redefined Strategy
On February 22, 2018, we announced that Lucinda M. Baier, our Chief Financial Officer, has been appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board of Directors effective February 28, 2018, at which time T. Andrew Smith will step down from such roles. We further announced that Bryan Richardson, our Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, will leave his employment effective March 9, 2018. Ms. Baier will continue to serve as our principal financial officer while we conduct a search for her replacement, and we do not currently intend to replace Mr. Richardson’s position.
For 2018, we have re-evaluated and redefined our strategic priorities, which are now focused on our three primary stakeholders: our stockholders, our associates, and, always at our foundation, our residents, patients and their families. Through our redefined strategy, we intend to provide attractive long-term returns to our stockholders; attract, engage, develop and retain the best associates; and continue to earn the trust and endorsements of our residents, patients and their families. 

• | Stockholders. Our stockholders’ continued investment in us allows us to advance our mission to our residents and their families. Therefore we believe we must balance our mission with an emphasis on margin. With this strategic priority, we intend to take actions to provide long-term returns to our stockholders by focusing on growing RevPAR, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow.

• | Associates. Brookdale’s culture is based on servant leadership, and our associates are the key to attracting and caring for residents and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Through this strategic priority, we intend to create a compelling value proposition for our associates in the areas of compensation, leadership, career growth and meaningful work. In 2017, we took the first corrective steps by investing in community leaders, and in 2018 we plan to extend this plan deeper in the communities.


• | Residents, Patients and Their Families. Brookdale continues to be driven by its mission—to enrich the lives of those we serve with compassion, respect, excellence and integrity—and we believe this continued focus is essential to create value for all of our stakeholders. This strategic priority includes enhancing our organizational alignment to foster an environment where our associates can focus on providing valued, high quality care and personalized service. We intend to win locally through our targeted sales and marketing efforts by differentiating our community and service offerings based on quality, a portfolio of choices, and personalized service delivered by caring associates. 

As part of our redefined strategy, we plan to continue to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, pursue lease restructurings, development and acquisition opportunities, including selectively acquiring existing operating companies, senior living communities and ancillary services companies. Any such restructurings or acquisitions may be pursued on our own, or through our investments in ventures. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate our owned and leased community portfolios for opportunities to dispose of owned communities and terminate leases. We plan to market in 2018 and sell approximately 30 owned communities (in addition to assets held for sale as of December 31, 2017), which we believe will generate more than $250 million of proceeds, net of associated debt and transaction costs.
We believe that our successful execution on these strategic priorities will allow us to achieve our goal to be the first choice in senior living by being the nation’s most trusted and effective senior living provider and employer.
2016 - 2017 Portfolio Optimization Update 
During 2016 and 2017, we engaged in an initiative to optimize our community portfolio through disposing of owned and leased communities, restructuring leases, and investing in our Program Max initiative in order to simplify and streamline our business, to increase the quality and durability of our cash flow, to improve our liquidity, and to reduce our debt and lease leverage. During the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we completed dispositions, through sales and lease terminations, of 165 communities. During 2017, we also amended and restated triple-net leases covering substantially all of the communities we lease from HCP, Inc. (“HCP”) into a master lease and invested $8.8 million on Program Max projects, net of $8.1 million of third party lessor reimbursements.
During 2018, we expect to close on the dispositions of 15 owned communities (1,508 units) classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017, the terminations of our triple-net leases on 33 communities (3,123 units), the terminations of management agreements on 37 communities (5,522 units) and our acquisitions of six communities that we currently lease or manage (995 units). In addition, we plan to market in 2018 and sell approximately 30 owned communities. 
The closings of the expected sales of assets are subject (where applicable) to our successful marketing of such assets on terms acceptable to us. Further, the closings of the various pending transactions and expected sales of assets are, or will be, subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including (where applicable) the receipt of regulatory approvals. However, there can be no assurance that the transactions will close or, if they do, when the actual closings will occur. 
See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a summary of the foregoing completed and pending transactions and their impact on our results of operations. 
The Senior Living Industry
The senior living industry has undergone dramatic growth in the last twenty years, marked by the emergence of the assisted living segment in the mid-1990s, and it remains highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional operators. We are one of a limited number of large operators that provide a broad range of community locations and service level offerings at varying price levels.
Beginning in 2007, the industry was affected negatively by the downturn in the general economy, which resulted in a near halt in construction of new units. The industry experienced a slow recovery in occupancy and rate growth beginning in 2010 according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing & Care Industry ("NIC").  In more recent years, as the economy and senior living industry have improved, the industry has attracted increased investment resulting in increased development of new senior housing supply.  According to NIC data, industry occupancy increased modestly through 2015, as the pace of absorption outpaced inventory growth slightly.  Starting in 2016, NIC data showed that industry occupancy began to decrease as a result of 
7

new openings, and based on projections of NIC, industry occupancy is expected to be flat through 2018.  During 2016 and 2017, we experienced an elevated rate of competitive new openings, with significant new competition opening in several of our markets, which adversely affected our occupancy, revenues, and results of operations. We continue to address such competition through pricing initiatives based on the competitive market, current in-place rents and occupancy; focusing on operations, including ensuring high customer satisfaction, protecting key leadership potions and actively engaging district and regional management in community operations; local and national marketing efforts, including leveraging our industry leading name through enhanced digital, direct mail and local community outreach; and community segmentation through which we evaluate current community position relative to competition and reposition if necessary (e.g., price, services, amenities and programming). We expect the elevated rate of competitive new openings and pressures on our occupancy and rate growth to continue through 2018.
We believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years. The primary market of the senior living industry is individuals age 75 and older. According to United States Census data, that group is projected to be the fastest growing age cohort over the next twenty years. As a result of scientific and medical breakthroughs over the past 30 years, seniors are living longer. Due to demographic trends, and continuing advances in science, nutrition and healthcare, the senior population will continue to grow, and we expect the demand for senior living services to continue to increase in future years.
We believe the senior living industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. Increased longevity results in increasing frailty in seniors, soaring rates of dementia among the elderly, and a growing burden of chronic illness and chronic conditions. As a result of increased mobility in society, a reduction of average family size and increased number of two-wage earner couples, families struggle to provide care for seniors and look for alternatives outside of their family for their care. There is a growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by senior living operators, which has further contributed to the demand for senior living services. Also, the current prospective senior customer possesses greater financial resources than in the past, which makes it more likely that they are able to afford to live in market-rate senior housing. 
Challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors, which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business. The regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us, accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials. In addition, like other companies, our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing employment costs including salaries, wages and benefits, such as health care benefit coverage, for our employees. Increases in the costs of food, utilities, insurance, and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results.
In addition, there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future. We cannot predict what action, if any, Congress will take on reimbursement policies of the Medicare or Medicaid programs or what future rule changes the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") will implement. Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods or timing of government reimbursement programs could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and cash flow.
Our History
We were formed as a Delaware corporation in June 2005 for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies, Brookdale Living Communities, Inc. ("BLC") and Alterra Healthcare Corporation ("Alterra"). BLC and Alterra had been operating independently since 1986 and 1981, respectively. On November 22, 2005, we completed our initial public offering of common stock, and on July 25, 2006, we acquired American Retirement Corporation ("ARC"), another leading senior living provider that had been operating independently since 1978. On September 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition of Horizon Bay, the then-ninth largest operator of senior living communities in the United States.
On July 31, 2014, we completed the acquisition by merger of Emeritus Corporation, a Washington corporation, pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into Emeritus, with Emeritus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. At the time of the merger, Emeritus was the second largest operator of senior living communities in the United States.
Our Communities and Service Offerings
We offer a variety of senior living housing and service alternatives in communities located across the United States. Our communities consist of retirement center communities, assisted living communities, rental CCRCs and entry fee CCRCs. We manage certain of our communities for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest pursuant to management 
8

agreements. In addition, through our ancillary services programs, we provide home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities.
Retirement Centers
Our retirement center communities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors generally age 75 and older who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service.  The majority of our retirement center communities consist of both independent and assisted living units in a single community, which allows residents to "age-in-place" by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services. While the number varies depending upon the particular community, as of December 31, 2017 approximately 79.0% of all of the units at our retirement center communities are independent living units, with the balance of units licensed for assisted living.
Our retirement center communities are large multi-story buildings averaging 190 units with extensive common areas and amenities. Residents may choose from studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units, depending upon the specific community.  Each retirement center community provides residents with basic services such as meal service, 24-hour emergency response, housekeeping, concierge services, transportation and recreational activities. Most of these communities also offer custom tailored supplemental care services at an additional charge, which may include medication reminders, check-in services and escort and companion services.
In addition to the basic services, our retirement center communities that include assisted living also provide residents with supplemental care service options to provide assistance with ADLs. The levels of care provided to residents vary from community to community depending, among other things, upon the licensing requirements and healthcare regulations of the state in which the community is located.
Residents in our retirement center communities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available to residents (not including skilled nursing) as their needs change.  Residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or, in certain communities, are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor. These communities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff, including nurses at the majority of communities, and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas.
Retirement center communities that we own or lease are included in our Retirement Centers segment, and retirement center communities for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2017, our Retirement Center segment consisted of 84 retirement center communities with 15,042 units, representing 15.0% of our total senior living capacity, and 45 retirement center communities with 9,434 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 9.4% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these retirement center communities represented 24.3% of our total senior living capacity.
Assisted Living
Our assisted living communities offer housing and 24-hour assistance with ADLs to mid-acuity frail and elderly residents. Our assisted living communities include both freestanding, multi-story communities with more than 50 beds, and smaller, freestanding single story communities with less than 50 beds. Depending upon the specific location, the community may include (i) private studio, one-bedroom and one-bedroom deluxe apartments, or (ii) individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or "neighborhoods" scaled to a single-family home, which includes a living room, dining room, patio or enclosed porch, laundry room and personal care area, as well as a caregiver work station.
We also operate memory care communities, which are freestanding assisted living communities specially designed for residents with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias requiring the attention, personal care and services needed to help cognitively impaired residents maintain a higher quality of life. Our memory care communities have from 14 to 69 beds and some are part of a campus setting which includes a freestanding assisted living community.
All residents at our assisted living and memory care communities receive the basic care level, which includes ongoing health assessments, three meals per day and snacks, coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian, assistance with coordination of physician care, social and recreational activities, housekeeping and personal laundry services. In some locations we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. In addition, we offer at additional cost, higher levels of personal care services to residents at these communities who are very physically frail or experiencing early stages of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia and who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments.
9

As a result of their progressive decline in cognitive abilities, residents at our memory care communities typically require higher levels of personal care and services and therefore pay higher monthly service fees. Specialized services include assistance with ADLs, behavior management and an activities program, the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents' remaining functional abilities. Whenever possible, residents participate in all facets of daily life at the residence, such as assisting with meals, laundry and housekeeping.
Assisted living communities (including memory care communities) that we own or lease are included in our Assisted Living segment, and assisted living communities for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2017, our Assisted Living segment consisted of 682 assisted living communities with 44,773 units, representing 44.5% of our total senior living capacity, and 140 assisted living communities with 11,945 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 11.9% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these assisted living communities represented 56.4% of our total senior living capacity.
As of December 31, 2017, we provide memory care services at 527 of our communities, aggregating 13,164 memory care units across our segments. These communities include 118 freestanding memory care communities with 4,575 units included in our Assisted Living segment.
CCRCs-Rental
Our CCRCs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health. Most of our CCRCs have independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing available on one campus or within the immediate market, and some also include Alzheimer's and dementia care service areas.
CCRCs that we own or lease are included in our CCRCs-Rental segment, and CCRCs for which we provide management services for third parties or unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest are included in our Management Services segment. As of December 31, 2017, our CCRCs-Rental segment included 28 CCRCs with 6,826 units, representing 6.8% of our total senior living capacity, and 44 CCRCs with 12,562 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 12.4% of our total senior living capacity. In the aggregate, these CCRCs represented 19.3% of our total senior living capacity.
Twenty of our CCRCs, of which 18 are included in the Management Services segment, allow for residents in the independent living apartment units to pay a one-time upfront entrance fee, typically $100,000 to $400,000 or more, which is partially refundable in certain circumstances. We refer to these communities as entry fee CCRCs. The amount of the entrance fee varies depending upon the type and size of the dwelling unit, the type of contract plan selected, whether the contract contains a lifecare benefit (i.e., a healthcare discount) for the resident, the amount and timing of the refund, and other variables. These agreements are subject to regulations in various states. In addition to their initial entrance fee, residents under all of our entrance fee agreements also pay a monthly service fee, which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services. Since entrance fees are paid upon initial occupancy, the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community. The refundable portion of a resident's entrance fee is generally refundable within a certain number of months or days following contract termination or upon the sale of the unit, or in some agreements, upon the resale of a comparable unit or 12 months after the resident vacates the unit. In addition, some entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale. As of December 31, 2017, our CCRCs-Rental segment included two entry fee CCRCs with 543 units, representing less than 0.5% of our total senior living capacity, and 18 entry fee CCRCs with 7,876 units were included in our Management Services segment, representing 7.8% of our total senior living capacity.
Brookdale Ancillary Services
Through our ancillary services programs, we currently provide home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services, as well as education and wellness programs, to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. The home health services we provide include skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pathology, home health aide services, and social services as needed. Our hospice services include clinical and skilled care, as well as spiritual and emotional counseling.  Our outpatient therapy services include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech language pathology services and other specialized therapy.  The majority of our home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services are reimbursed by government reimbursement programs, primarily Medicare, and non-covered services are paid directly by residents from private pay sources.  Our education and wellness programs focus on wellness and physical fitness to allow residents to maintain maximum independence. These services provide many continuing education opportunities for seniors and their families through health fairs, seminars, and other consultative interactions. We believe that our ancillary services offerings are unique in 
10

the senior living industry and that we have a significant advantage over our competitors with respect to providing ancillary services because of our established infrastructure, scale and experience.
Our Brookdale Ancillary Services segment includes the home health, hospice and outpatient therapy services provided to residents of many of our communities and to seniors living outside of our communities. The Brookdale Ancillary Services segment does not include skilled nursing or inpatient therapy services provided in our skilled nursing units, which are included in the CCRCs-Rental segment. During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we significantly reduced the number of outpatient therapy clinics located in our communities as lower reimbursement rates and lower utilization made the business less attractive.
Management Services
We operate certain of our communities pursuant to management agreements. In some of these cases, the community is owned by third parties and, in other cases, the community is owned in an unconsolidated venture in which we have an ownership interest. Under the management agreements for these communities, we receive management fees as well as reimbursed expenses, which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners.
The majority of our management agreements are long-term agreements. In most cases, either party to the agreements may terminate upon the occurrence of an event of default caused by the other party. In addition, in some cases, subject to our rights, if any, to cure deficiencies, community owners may terminate us as manager if any licenses or certificates necessary for operation are revoked, if we do not satisfy certain designated performance thresholds or if the community is sold to an unrelated third party (in which case we may be entitled to receive a contractual termination fee). Also, in some instances, a community owner may terminate the management agreement relating to a particular community if we are in default under other management agreements relating to other communities owned by the same owner or its affiliates. Certain of our management agreements, both with unconsolidated ventures and with entities owned by third parties, provide that an event of default under the debt instruments applicable to the ventures or the entities owned by third parties that is caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the relevant management agreement, giving the non-Brookdale party to the management agreement the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the management agreement, potentially including termination of the management agreement. Further, in the event of default on a loan, the lender may have the ability to terminate us as manager. With respect to communities held in unconsolidated ventures, in some cases, the management agreement can be terminated in connection with the sale by the venture partner of its interest in the venture or the sale of properties by the venture.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 73.9% of our management fees revenue was derived from services provided to unconsolidated ventures in which HCP held an interest, including 29.1% of our management fees revenue derived from services provided to our unconsolidated CCRC venture in which we share control with HCP. Early termination or non-renewal of, or renewal on less-favorable terms, of our management agreements (including our management agreements with such unconsolidated ventures) could cause a loss in revenues and could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.
As of December 31, 2017, the 229 communities and 33,941 units in our Management Services segment represented 33.7% of our total senior living capacity. As of that date, we operated 61 communities, representing 8,222 units, for third parties and 168 communities, representing 25,719 units, for unconsolidated ventures in which we have an ownership interest. As of December 31, 2017, these communities consisted of 45 retirement center communities (9,434 units), 140 assisted living communities (11,945 units) and 44 CCRCs (12,562 units).
Competitive Strengths
We believe our nationwide network of senior living communities and ancillary services networks are well positioned to benefit from the growth and increasing demand in the industry. Some of our most significant competitive strengths are:

• | Skilled management team with extensive experience. Our senior management team and our Board of Directors have extensive experience in the senior living, healthcare and real estate industries, including the acquisition, operation and management of a broad range of senior living assets.


• | Geographically diverse, high-quality, purpose-built communities. As of December 31, 2017, we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the United States based on total capacity, with 1,023 communities in 46 states and the ability to serve approximately 101,000 residents.


• | Ability to provide a broad spectrum of care. Given our diverse mix of retirement centers, assisted living communities and CCRCs, as well as our ancillary services offerings, we are able to meet a wide range of our customers' needs. We believe that

11

we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability and the only company that does so at scale on a national basis. We believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross-selling opportunities.

• | The size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies. The size of our business allows us to realize cost savings and economies of scale in the procurement of goods and services. Our scale also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions. We intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform. Our geographic footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. In connection with our formation transactions and our acquisitions, we negotiated new contracts for food, insurance and other goods and services. In addition, we have and will continue to consolidate corporate functions such as accounting, finance, human resources, legal, information technology and marketing.


• | Significant experience in providing ancillary services. Through our ancillary services programs, we provide a range of home health, hospice, outpatient therapy, education, wellness and other ancillary services to residents of certain of our communities and to seniors outside our communities, which we believe is a distinct competitive difference. We have significant experience in providing these ancillary services and expect to receive additional revenues as we expand our ancillary service offerings to additional communities and to seniors outside of our communities.

Segments
As of December 31, 2017, we had five reportable segments: Retirement Centers; Assisted Living; CCRCs-Rental; Brookdale Ancillary Services and Management Services. These segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision maker organizes our business activities for making operating decisions, assessing performance, developing strategy and allocating capital resources.
Operating results and financial metrics from our five business segments are discussed further in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operations
Operations Overview
We have implemented intensive standards, policies and procedures and systems, including detailed staff manuals and training materials, which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service. Further, we believe our centralized support infrastructure allows our community-based leaders and personnel to focus on resident care and family connections. Our operating procedures include securing national vendor contracts to obtain lower pricing for certain services such as food, supplies and insurance, implementing effective budgeting and financial controls at each community, and establishing standardized training and operations procedures.  We have also established company-wide policies and procedures relating to, among other things: resident care; community design and community operations; billing and collections; accounts payable; finance and accounting; risk management; development of employee training materials and programs; marketing activities; the hiring and training of management and other community-based personnel; compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements; and implementation of our acquisition, development and leasing plans.
Consolidated Corporate Operations Support
We have developed a centralized support infrastructure and services platform, which provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities. The size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as human resources, finance, accounting, legal, information technology and marketing. We are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food, supplies, insurance, benefits, and other goods and services. In addition, we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and communities in areas such as training, regulatory affairs, asset management, dining and procurement.
Community Staffing and Training
Each community has an Executive Director responsible for the overall day-to-day operations of the community, including quality of care and service, social services and financial performance. Each Executive Director receives specialized training from us. In addition, a portion of each Executive Director's compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the community and key care and service quality measures.  We continue to take actions intended to simplify the role of our Executive Directors to 
12

allow them to focus on our residents and their families and our associates.  We believe that the quality of our communities, coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy, has enabled us to attract high-quality, professional community Executive Directors.
Depending upon the size of the community, each Executive Director is supported by a community staff member (health and wellness director or nursing director) who is directly responsible for day-to-day care of residents and community marketing and sales staff with regional support to oversee the community's sales, marketing and community outreach programs. Other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service, healthcare services, activities, housekeeping, and maintenance.
We believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact. Employees involved in resident care, including the administrative staff, are trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques. We have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents. We have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold frequent training sessions for management and staff at each site.
Quality Assurance
We maintain quality assurance programs at each of our communities through our corporate and regional staff. Our quality assurance programs are designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services that we provide. Our quality control measures include, among other things, community inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis. These inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds; the appearance and cleanliness of the interior; the professionalism and friendliness of staff; quality of resident care (including assisted living services, nursing care, therapy and home health programs); the quality of activities and the dining program; observance of residents in their daily living activities; and compliance with government regulations. Our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided to residents.
In order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents' needs and desires, at many of our communities, we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets monthly with the Executive Director of the community. Separate resident committees also exist at many of these communities for food service, activities, marketing and hospitality. These committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable community management to be more responsive to the residents' needs and desires.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing efforts are intended to create awareness of our Brookdale brand, our communities, our products and our services among potential residents and their family members and among referral sources, including hospital discharge planners, physicians, clergy, area agencies for the elderly, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies and social workers. Our marketing staff develops overall strategies for promoting our communities and monitors the success of our multi-layered marketing efforts, including outreach programs. In addition to direct contacts with prospective referral sources, we also rely on internet inquiries, contact centers, print advertising, e-mail and digital marketing, social media, direct mail, signage and special events, health fairs and community receptions. Certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted within the limitations of federal and state laws at many communities.
We will continue to leverage our brand recognition while pursuing a multi-layered marketing approach. We have also launched and embedded a new sales model, Network Selling, aimed at optimizing the customer experience as they consider the many options that we provide in markets and care-levels. With this new sales model, a lead sales associate in many of our markets will be responsible for better coordinating our sales efforts among our communities within a given market. Additionally, we have begun segmenting our communities to align their operating standards with their optimal market position. These community segmentation efforts are intended to identify optimal levels of price, service offerings, amenities and programs to be offered based on local demand and supply so that we can adjust our operating standards to create differentiated value to meet the needs of our customers.
Competition
The senior living industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous organizations that provide similar senior living alternatives, such as home health care agencies, community-based service programs, retirement communities, convalescent centers and other senior living providers. In addition, over the last several years there has been an increase in the construction of new senior housing assets as the industry has attracted increased investment.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, NIC data showed that industry occupancy began to decrease as a result of new openings, and based on projections of NIC, industry occupancy is expected to be flat through 2018.  During 2016 and 2017, we experienced an elevated rate of competitive new openings, with significant new competition opening in several of our markets, which adversely affected our occupancy, revenues, and results of 
13

operations. We expect the elevated rate of competitive new openings and pressures on our occupancy and rate growth to continue through 2018. In general, regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the retirement center and assisted living sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial. Consequently, we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract residents or expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our occupancy, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Our major publicly-traded competitors that operate senior living communities are Five Star Quality Care, Inc. and Capital Senior Living Corporation. Our major private competitors include Holiday Retirement, Life Care Services, LLC, and Sunrise Senior Living, LLC, as well as a large number of not-for-profit entities.
Although our focus in the near term will be executing on our refined strategy, we plan to continue to evaluate and, where opportunities arise, selectively purchase existing operating companies, senior living communities, including those that we currently lease or manage, and ancillary services companies.  The market for acquiring and/or operating senior living communities is highly competitive, and some of our present and potential senior living competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital. In addition, several publicly-traded and non-traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and private equity firms have similar asset acquisition objectives as we do, along with greater financial resources and/or lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain. Partially as a result of tax law changes enacted through RIDEA, we now compete more directly with the various publicly-traded healthcare REITs for the acquisition of senior housing properties. The largest three of these publicly-traded healthcare REITs measured on equity market capitalization include HCP, Inc., Ventas, Inc. and Welltower, Inc.
Customers
Our target retirement center residents are senior citizens age 75 and older who desire or need a more supportive living environment. A number of our retirement center residents relocate to one of our communities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children.
Our target assisted living residents are predominantly senior citizens age 80 and older who require daily assistance with two or more ADLs. Residents typically enter an assisted living community due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have been triggered by a medical event or need.
Our target CCRC residents are senior citizens who are seeking a community that offers a variety of services and a continuum of care so that they can "age-in-place." These residents generally first enter the community as a resident of an independent living unit and may later move into an assisted living or skilled nursing area as their needs change.
Seasonality
Our seniors housing business has typically experienced some seasonality, which we experience in certain regions more than others, due to weather patterns, geography and higher incidence and severity of illnesses during winter months.  Although our seasonal pattern varies from year to year, our average monthly occupancy generally begins to decline sequentially during the fourth quarter of the year, and we generally expect average monthly occupancy to begin to increase during the second quarter each year.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 49,500 full-time employees and approximately 26,100 part-time employees, of which 566 work in our Brentwood, Tennessee (a suburb of Nashville) headquarters office, 610 work in our Milwaukee, Wisconsin office and 981 work in our smaller regional support offices and a variety of field-based management positions. We currently consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
Medicare and Medicaid Programs
We rely on reimbursement from government programs, including the Medicare program and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid programs, for a portion of our revenues. Reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid represented 12.6% and 2.7%, respectively, of our total resident fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the period, Medicare reimbursements represented 86.3% of our Ancillary Services segment revenue, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements represented 23.1% of our CCRCs-Rental segment revenue. 
Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over and certain disabled persons. We receive revenue for our home health, hospice, skilled nursing and outpatient therapy services from Medicare. 
14

Medicaid is a medical assistance program administered by each state, funded with federal and state funds pursuant to which healthcare benefits are available to certain indigent or disabled patients. We receive reimbursements under Medicaid (including state Medicaid waiver programs) for many of our assisted living communities. 
These government reimbursement programs are highly regulated, involve significant administrative discretion, and are subject to frequent and substantial legislative, administrative and interpretive changes, which may significantly affect reimbursement rates and the methods and timing of payments made under these programs. Continuing efforts of government to contain healthcare costs could materially and adversely affect us, and reimbursement levels may not remain at levels comparable to present levels or may not be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement. During 2016, we significantly reduced the number of our outpatient therapy clinics located in our communities due, in part, to lower reimbursement rates making the business less attractive.
Medicare reimbursement for home health and skilled nursing services is subject to fixed payments under the Medicare prospective payment systems. In accordance with Medicare laws, CMS makes annual adjustments to Medicare payment rates in many prospective payment systems under what is commonly known as a “market basket update.” Each year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”), a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, recommends payment policies to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations and based on previous years, there can be no assurance that Congress will adopt MedPAC’s recommendations in any given year. 
Medicaid reimbursement rates for many of our assisted living communities also are based upon fixed payment systems. Generally, these rates are adjusted annually for inflation. However, those adjustments may not reflect actual increases of the cost of providing healthcare services. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement can be impacted negatively by state budgetary pressures, which may lead to reduced reimbursement or delays in receiving payments.
Audits and Investigations
As a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various government reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. CMS has engaged a number of third party firms, including Recovery Audit Contractors (RAC), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPIC) to conduct extensive reviews of claims data to evaluate the appropriateness of billings submitted for payment. Audit contractors may identify overpayments based on coverage requirements, billing and coding rules or other risk areas. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities. An adverse determination of government reviews, audits and investigations may result in citations, sanctions and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our costs to respond to and defend any such audits, reviews and investigations may be significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment, and any resulting sanctions or criminal, civil or regulatory penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act
To help fund the expansion of health care coverage to previously uninsured people, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), which became law in 2010, provides for certain reforms to the health care delivery and payment system aimed at increasing quality and reducing costs. 
As it relates to our business, the Affordable Care Act provides for reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for home health and hospice agencies and additional annual “productivity adjustment” reductions to the annual market basket payment update as determined by CMS for skilled nursing facilities (beginning in federal fiscal year 2012), home health agencies (beginning in federal fiscal year 2015), and hospice agencies (beginning in federal fiscal year 2013). These reductions have, and could in the future, result in lower reimbursement than the previous year. The Affordable Care Act also provides for new transparency, reporting, and certification requirements for skilled nursing facilities. 
Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act mandates changes to home health and hospice benefits under Medicare. For home health, the Affordable Care Act mandates creation of a value-based purchasing program, development of quality measures, a decrease in home health reimbursement beginning with federal fiscal year 2014 that is being phased-in over a four-year period, a reduction in the outlier cap, and reinstatement of a 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas on or after April 1, 2010 and before January 1, 2016. In addition, the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary of HHS to test different models for delivery of care, some of which would involve home health services. It also requires the Secretary to establish a national 
15

pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions, bundling payment for acute hospital care, physician services, outpatient hospital services, and post-acute care services, which would include home health. The Affordable Care Act further directed the Secretary of HHS to rebase payments for home health, which resulted in a decrease in home health reimbursement that began in 2014 and is being phased-in over a four-year period. The Secretary is also required to conduct a study to evaluate costs and quality of care among efficient home health agencies regarding access to care and treating Medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness and to provide a report to Congress. 
Potential efforts in the Congress to alter, amend, repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act, or to fail to fund various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, create additional uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the Affordable Care Act on us and the healthcare industry. The healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, as well as other similar healthcare reforms, including any potential change in the nature of services we provide, the methods or amount of payment we receive for such services, and the underlying regulatory environment, could adversely affect our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) became law in 2015. The legislation, among other things, permanently replaced the sustainable growth rate formula previously used to determine updates to Medicare fee schedule payments with quality and value measurements and participation in alternate payment models; extended the Medicare Part B outpatient therapy cap exception process until December 31, 2017; extended the 3% add-on payment for home health services delivered to residents in rural areas until December 31, 2017; and set payment updates for post-acute providers at 1% after other adjustments required by the Affordable Care Act for 2018. As a result of changes to reimbursement due to the Affordable Care Act and MACRA, our home health reimbursement decreased by 3.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, and we expect our home health reimbursement to decrease by 0.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018. As part of federal budget legislation that became law on February 9, 2018, the Medicare Part B cap on outpatient therapy services was permanently repealed effective January 1, 2018.
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”), which became law in 2014, requires standardized assessment data for quality improvement, payment, and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post-acute care, including home health, hospice and skilled nursing. The IMPACT Act will require such agencies and facilities to begin reporting standardized patient assessment data, new quality measures, and resource use measures. Failure to report such data when required would subject an agency or facility to a two percent reduction in market basket prices then in effect. The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and MedPAC to study, and report to Congress by 2022 regarding, alternative post-acute care payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting. 
Home Health Pre-Claim Review Demonstration
In 2016, CMS announced that it would implement a 3-year Medicare pre-claim review demonstration for home health services in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. We derive a significant portion of our home health revenue from these states. The pre-claim review is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. CMS began the pre-claim review demonstration in Illinois in August 2016. Effective in April 2017, CMS paused for an indefinite period the demonstration in Illinois and the implementation of the demonstration in the other states. The pre-claim review demonstration resulted in increased administrative costs and reimbursement delays for our Illinois home health agency. If CMS were to restart implementation of the pre-claim review process, it could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. 
Industry Regulation
The regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it. In addition, federal, state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations. This is particularly true for large for-profit, multi-community providers like us. Some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include: state and local laws impacting licensure, protecting consumers against deceptive practices, and generally affecting the communities' management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations, such as fire, health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws; federal and state laws governing Medicare and Medicaid, which regulate allowable costs, pricing, quality of services, quality of care, food service, resident rights (including abuse and neglect) and fraud; federal and state residents' rights statutes and regulations; Anti-Kickback and physicians referral ("Stark") laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are unable to predict 
16

the future course of federal, state and local legislation or regulation. Changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Many senior living communities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities. Although requirements vary from state to state, these requirements may address, among others, the following: personnel education, training and records; community services; staffing; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; emergency power generator requirements; professional licensing and certification of staff; and resident rights and responsibilities. In several of the states there are different levels of care that can be provided based on the level of licensure. In addition, in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate, assisted living communities, home health agencies and/or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded. Senior living communities may also be subject to state and/or local building, zoning, fire and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted. These laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets.
Unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi-annually, or following a regulator's receipt of a complaint about the provider. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we receive survey reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys. Most inspection deficiencies are resolved through a plan of corrective action relating to the community's operations, but the reviewing agency may have the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community, which could result in the imposition of fines, imposition of a provisional or conditional license, suspension or revocation of a license, suspension or denial of admissions, loss of certification as a provider under federal reimbursement programs or imposition of other sanctions, including criminal penalties. Loss, suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults. Sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers' or facilities' history of compliance. We may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations. To date, none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension, fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues. However, any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole. In addition, states Attorneys General vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry. State Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Units may also investigate assisted living communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds.
Regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry, particularly assisted living. Our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments, such as federal assisted living laws and regulations, as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials or increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties. Certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed. Furthermore, certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state. Revocation or suspension of a license, or a citation, at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities, which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross-defaults or may also trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements, or adversely affect our ability to operate and/or obtain financing in the future. If a state were to find that one community's citation will impact another of our communities, this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency. If regulatory requirements increase, whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules, including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups, in addition to federal and state regulators, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws, which may result in civil and/or criminal penalties against the community or individual.
There are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals, relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers, including those in the senior living industry, and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti-fraud initiatives. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 expanded the penalties for health care fraud. In addition, with respect to our participation in federal health care reimbursement programs, the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the False Claims Act alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties. The False Claims Act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government's recovery. Because of these incentives, so-called "whistleblower" suits have become more frequent. 
17

Additionally, since we operate communities that participate in federal and/or state health care reimbursement programs, we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement which are false, fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Similar state laws vary from state to state. Violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure, citations, sanctions and other criminal or civil fines and penalties, the refund of overpayments, payment suspensions, or termination of participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs, which may also cause us to default under our debt and lease documents and/or trigger cross-defaults.
We are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers, such as the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, the Stark laws and certain state referral laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay (or to solicit or receive) "any remuneration ... directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind" for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral. If we were to violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Law, we may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions, including fines and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs, which may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and/or trigger cross-defaults. Adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal Stark laws related to certain Medicare and Medicaid physician referrals. While we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living communities, it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations. 
We are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules pursuant to HIPAA relating to the privacy of such information. Rules that became effective in 2003 govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain HIPAA covered communities. We established procedures to comply with HIPAA privacy requirements at these communities. We were required to be in compliance with the HIPAA rule establishing administrative, physical and technical security standards for health information by 2005. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with these rules.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property, such as us, may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances, including, among others, petroleum and materials containing asbestos, that could be located on, in, at or under a property, regardless of how such materials came to be located there. Additionally, such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances, including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property. The cost of any required investigation, remediation, removal, mitigation, compliance, fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property's value and/or our assets' value. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell such property, to attract additional residents and retain existing residents, to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property. In addition, such laws impose liability for investigation, remediation, removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third-party sites. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred. Moreover, the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several, which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof. We do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws, including those relating to: the handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities; identification and warning of the presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings, as well as removal of such materials; the presence of other substances in the indoor environment; and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties.
Some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents, including, for example, blood-contaminated bandages, swabs and other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease. The management of infectious medical waste, including its handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal, is subject to regulation under various federal, state and local environmental laws. These environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste, as well as related permit, record-keeping, notice and reporting obligations. Each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste. The use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of 
18

such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies, nor does it immunize us from third-party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed. Any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building's management to identify and warn, via signs and labels, their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in their buildings. The regulations also set forth employee training, record-keeping requirements and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. Significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations. Building owners and those exercising control over a building's management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials. The regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials in which we have invested. Federal, state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal, encapsulation, disturbance, handling and/or disposal of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction, remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials and may provide for fines to, and for third parties to seek recovery from, owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos-containing materials and potential asbestos-containing materials.
The presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation, mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan. Furthermore, the presence of mold, lead-based paint, contaminants in drinking water, radon and/or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners, operators or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage. In some circumstances, areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs, and even after successful remediation, the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community's market value.
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws.
We are unable to predict the future course of federal, state and local environmental regulation and legislation. Changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change, such as the proposed "cap and trade" legislation) could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, because environmental laws vary from state to state, expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities.
