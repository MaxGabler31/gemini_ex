GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the “Corporation”) was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. The Corporation, individually or together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the “Registrant.” The Corporation classifies its businesses in two segments: Forged and Cast Engineered Products and Air and Liquid Processing. 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS 
 The sales and operating results of the Corporation’s two segments and the identifiable assets attributable to both segments for the three years ended December 31, 2017, are set forth in Note 21 (Business Segments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment 
 Union Electric Steel Corporation produces ingot and forged products that service a wide variety of industries globally. It specializes in the production of forged hardened steel rolls used in cold rolling by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals throughout the world. In addition, it produces ingot and open-die forged products which are used in the oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. Union Electric Steel Corporation is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, with three manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania, one in Indiana and one in Ohio. It is one of the largest producers of forged hardened steel rolls in the world. In addition to a few domestic competitors, several major European, South American and Asian manufacturers also compete in both the domestic and foreign markets. In 2007, a subsidiary of Union Electric Steel Corporation became a 49% partner in a joint venture in China to manufacture large forged backup rolls, principally in weights and sizes larger than those which can be made in the subsidiary’s facilities in the United States. In 2016, the ownership interest in the joint venture was reduced to 33%.

 Raw Materials 
 Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporation’s subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but do make forward commitments for the supply of natural gas and certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 13 (Derivative Instruments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold some patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of management they are not material to either segment. 
 Backlog 
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2017, was approximately $326 million, compared to a backlog of $234 million at year-end 2016. Approximately 6% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2018. 
Competition 
 The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant participants in each of the niche markets which they serve.
