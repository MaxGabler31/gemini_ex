Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company specializing in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions, in particular, diseases caused primarily by exposure to sunlight that result in sun damage to the skin. Our licensed products primarily focus on the treatment of actinic keratoses, which are skin lesions that can sometimes lead to skin cancer. We also market a topical antibiotic for treatment of impetigo, a bacterial skin infection.
 
Our principal licensed product is Ameluz®, which is a prescription drug approved for use in combination with the Ameluz Licensor’s Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved medical device, the RhodoLED® lamp series, for photodynamic therapy, or PDT (when used together, “Ameluz® PDT”) in the United States for the lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp. We are currently selling Ameluz® for this indication in the U.S. under an exclusive amended and restated license and supply agreement, as amended (“Ameluz LSA”), dated as of June 16, 2021, by and among us and the Ameluz Licensor. See “Business—Commercial Partners and Agreements—Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience” in this Form 10-K for more information. Under the Ameluz LSA, we hold the exclusive license to sell Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series comprising the BF-RhodoLED® and the new, more advanced RhodoLED® XL in the United States for all indications currently approved by the FDA as well as all future FDA-approved indications identified under the Ameluz LSA. We have the authority under the Ameluz LSA in certain circumstances to take over clinical development, regulatory work and manufacturing from the Ameluz Licensor, with respect to the FDA applications and clinical studies identified in the Ameluz LSA, if they are unable or unwilling to perform these functions appropriately. However, the Ameluz Licensor does not have any obligation under the Ameluz LSA, to perform or finance clinical trials to promote new indications beyond those identified in the Ameluz LSA. As further described below, under the Ameluz LSA, further extensions of the approved indications for Ameluz® photodynamic therapy in the United States are anticipated.
 
Our second prescription drug licensed product in our portfolio is Xepi® (ozenoxacin cream, 1%), a topical non-fluorinated quinolone that inhibits bacterial growth. Currently, no antibiotic resistance against Xepi® is known and it has been specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of impetigo, a common skin infection, due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is approved for use in the United States in adults and children 2 months and older. We are currently selling Xepi® for this indication in the United States under an exclusive license and supply agreement, as amended (“Xepi LSA”), with Ferrer that was assumed by Biofrontera on March 25, 2019 through our acquisition of Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc.
 
On March 25, 2019, we acquired Cutanea from Maruho Co., Ltd. In November 2018, Cutanea launched Xepi®, a prescription cream for the treatment of impetigo. The acquisition of Cutanea in March 2019 enabled us to market an FDA-approved drug that has already been introduced in the U.S. market. Although recent developments with respect to the third-party manufacturer that was providing our supply of Xepi® have impacted the timing of sales expansion and improved market positioning, –– we believe that Xepi® has the potential to be another innovative product with a large market potential in our portfolio.  See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates —Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment” in this Form 10-K.
 
As a licensee, we rely on our licensors to conduct clinical trials in order to pursue extensions to the current product indications approved by the FDA. Currently, the Ameluz Licensor has submitted applications to the FDA for the following indications with respect to our flagship licensed product Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series. These studies are all being pursued as part of the Investigational New Drug Application that the Ameluz Licensor submitted to the FDA in 2017 for the development of Ameluz®/BF-RhodoLED® lamp to treat superficial basal cell carcinoma.

We have the authority under the Ameluz LSA with respect to each of the indications described in the table above (as well as certain other clinical studies identified in the Corrected Amendment to the Ameluz LSA) in certain circumstances to take over clinical development, regulatory work and manufacturing from the Ameluz Licensor, if they are unable or unwilling to perform these functions appropriately. The Ameluz Licensor may choose, but has no obligation under the Ameluz LSA, to seek FDA approval with respect to additional indications. The pursuit of any additional indications beyond those identified in the Ameluz LSA would need to be separately negotiated between us and the Ameluz Licensor.
 
The current development pipeline is intended to expand commercialization in the United States of Ameluz®, as a combination product with the RhodoLED® lamp series, by means of marketing additional indications for our licensed products. The Ameluz LSA entitles us to an exclusive license in the United States of the products covered under the Ameluz LSA which includes any future indications that the Biofrontera Group may pursue with the FDA.
 
We currently do not have the ability to conduct any clinical trials, nor do we exercise any control over the progress of clinical trials for our licensed products. Under the Ameluz LSA and the Xepi LSA, our Licensors control clinical development for the applicable licensed product. With respect to each of the FDA applications and clinical studies identified in the Ameluz LSA and under certain circumstances, for example, if the Ameluz Licensor fails to pursue mutually beneficial clinical development, we may choose to organize and finance trials and subtract the cost from the transfer price of future shipments.


We are unaware of any immediate or near-term plans of Ferrer for a U.S.-market focused development pipeline.

Our Product Portfolio
 
Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® Lamp Series
 
Our principal marketed licensed product is Ameluz®. Ameluz® is used in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp or the new and more advanced RhodoLED XL, each an FDA approved medical device, in photodynamic therapy to selectively remove actinic keratosis, a chronic, pre-cancerous skin condition with the potential of progression to invasive skin cancer. We are currently selling Ameluz® in the United States on an exclusive basis through the Ameluz LSA.
 
In general, photodynamic therapy is a two-step process:
 

● | the first step is the application of a drug known as a “photosensitizer,” or a pre-cursor of this type of drug, which tends to accumulate in cancerous cells; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the second step is activation of the photosensitizer by controlled exposure to a selective light source in the presence of oxygen. 

 
During this process, energy from the light activates the photosensitizer. In photodynamic therapy, the activated photosensitizer transfers energy to oxygen molecules found in cells, converting the oxygen into a highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), which destroys or alters the sensitized cells.


Ameluz® is a photosensitizer which is activated by the red light generated by our RhodoLED® lamps to create the reactive oxygen species that will cause necrosis or apoptosis of the targeted cells. Biofrontera Pharma is considered the responsible manufacturer for Ameluz® by the FDA. Biofrontera Pharma currently manufactures through a single unaffiliated contract manufacturer in Switzerland, Glaropharm AG, and has recently signed an agreement with a second unaffiliated contract manufacturer located in Germany, Pharbil Waltrop GmbH, to ensure stability of the supply chain.
 
Photodynamic therapy can be a highly selective treatment that targets specific cells while minimizing damage to normal surrounding tissues. It also can allow for multiple courses of therapy. Hence the mode of action of photodynamic therapy requires destruction of the altered cells, temporary local skin reactions and inflammation of the treated area might be expected. In the Ameluz Licensor’s Phase III trials, the resulting redness and/or inflammation resolved within 1 to 4 days in most cases; in some cases, however, it persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. Topical application of a photosensitizer nevertheless should be combined with informing the patients to avoid direct sunlight and/or to wear protective clothing and sunscreen for some days after the treatment. Patients’ indoor activities are generally unrestricted except that they are told to avoid bright lights. The degree of selectivity and period of skin photosensitivity varies among different photosensitizers and is also related to the drug dose given. Unless activated by light, photosensitizers have no direct photodynamic therapy effects.


The RhodoLED® PDT-lamp series uses LEDs emitting red light at a wavelength of approximately 635 nm specifically designed for photodynamic therapy to activate the photosensitizer. The red light emitted by the RhodoLED® lamp series is outside the infrared range, reducing the likelihood for discomfort from warming. Other light wavelengths can also activate the photosensitizer, but red light is known for penetrating the skin deepest. The RhodoLED® lamp series is assembled at the Ameluz Licensor’s corporate headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany. Supply of the lamp is regulated via our Ameluz LSA. As such, Biofrontera Pharma is considered the responsible manufacturer of the RhodoLED® lamp series by the FDA.
 
We believe the BF-RhodoLED® lamp combines a controlled and consistent emission of light at the required wavelength with simplicity of design, user-friendliness and energy efficiency. The BF-RhodoLED® lamp contains a fan used to blow air over the treated skin surface and power settings for the fan. The lamp is approved in the United States by the FDA as a combination product for use in treatment of actinic keratosis with Ameluz®.

In late October 2021, the new, larger RhodoLED® XL was approved by the FDA in combination with Ameluz® for the treatment of mild and moderate actinic keratoses on the face and scalp, which corresponds to the current approval of Ameluz®. The new PDT-lamp enables the illumination of larger areas, thus allowing the simultaneous treatment of several actinic keratoses distant from each other. The treatment parameters of the new RhodoLED® XL, such as light dose, illumination time and wavelength of light are identical to the predecessor model BF-RhodoLED®. In order to meet the FDA’s strict requirements for the manufacture of a class III medical device, production of the new lamp has, similar to the older model, been established at the Ameluz Licensor’s headquarters in Leverkusen. The BF-RhodoLED® model will continue to be offered in the US market.
 
History of Approved Indications and Active Applications
 
Following the centralized European regulatory approval by the European Commission for Ameluz® (“love the light”) 78 mg/g Gel for the treatment of actinic keratoses of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp in December 2011, the Ameluz Licensor received approval from the FDA in the United States in May 2016. Under the approval, Ameluz® is to be marketed in combination with photodynamic therapy using the BF-RhodoLED® lamp for lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp. Thus, in the United States, Ameluz® is to be used in combination with exposure to light using the BF-RhodoLED® lamp. Through our Ameluz LSA, we launched the commercialization of Ameluz® and the BF-RhodoLED® lamp for the treatment actinic keratosis in the United States in October 2016.
 
For the Ameluz Licensor’s medical device products BF-RhodoLED® and RhodoLED® XL, three priority patent applications have been filed. The first one was submitted by the Ameluz Licensor as a PCT application to the EPO on June 5, 2019. The corresponding national phase in the U.S. was initiated by the Ameluz Licensor on November 17, 2020. The international application was published on December 10, 2020. Two more applications were submitted by the Ameluz Licensor to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), one on October 15, 2020, and the other one on March 29, 2021. All three applications aim at protecting both hardware and software in the Biofrontera Group’s PDT-lamps and thus could, once granted, also protect Ameluz® itself in the United States, due to the specifics of the FDA’s combination approval.


An international patent application entitled “Photodynamic therapy comprising two light exposures at different wavelengths” was filed by Biofrontera Bioscience on August 23, 2018, which describes a combined PDT (photodynamic therapy) modality. The invention relates to the application of a composition comprising a photosensitizer followed by two consecutive exposures of the treatment area to light, firstly natural daylight and secondly light of a wavelength corresponding to the absorption of the photosensitizer. This application has been nationalized in seven countries including the United States and regionalized as a European patent application.
 
On December 2, 2021, Biofrontera AG announced that the USPTO had issued a Notice of Allowance for the U.S. patent application number 17/234,490, titled “Illumination for Photodynamic Therapy,” that covers an innovative, pain-reducing illumination protocol for photodynamic therapy. Subsequently, the patent was granted in February 2022.   
 
On December 8, 2021, Biofrontera AG announced that the USPTO has issued a Notice of Allowance for Biofrontera Pharma GmbH’s U.S. patent number 17/215,785 (‘785 patent), titled “Illumination device for photodynamic therapy, method for treating a skin disease and method for operating an illumination device,” which protects a number of innovations relating to the RhodoLED XL® lamp. Subsequently, the patent was granted in January 2022.
 
Actinic keratoses
 
Actinic keratoses are superficial potentially pre-cancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that may, if left untreated, develop into a form of potentially life-threatening skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Actinic keratoses typically appear on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, bald scalp, arms or the back of the hands, and are often elevated, flaky, and rough in texture, and appear on the skin as hyperpigmented spots.


According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, actinic keratosis affects approximately 58 million people in the United States, and, if left untreated, up to 5-10 percent of actinic keratoses lesions develop into squamous cell carcinomas every year. 1 On average, this transformation into squamous cell carcinoma occurs within two years of formation of the initial actinic keratosis lesion.

Squamous cell carcinoma is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells arising in the squamous cells, which reside in the skin’s upper layer (the epidermis). Squamous cell carcinomas often appear as scaly red patches, open sores, elevated growths with a central depression, or warts; and they may crust or bleed. They can become disfiguring and sometimes deadly if allowed to grow. According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, squamous cell carcinoma has been the second most common form of skin cancer, but its incidence has been rapidly increasing. According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, more than one million cases of squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the United States, and it has been estimated that as many as 15,000 people die from the disease each year in the United States. Incidence of the disease has increased by 200% in the past three decades in the United States and it has recently matched the incidence of basal cell carcinoma in the Medicare fee-for-service population, which had been the most common form of human cancers.
 
Actinic keratosis typically develops on areas of chronic sun exposed skin. The necessity to treat actinic keratosis arises from the inherent risk of progression to invasive skin cancer, the chronic character of the disease and the potentiated risk for patients with multiple actinic keratoses. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends treating actinic keratosis to reduce your risk of developing skin cancer2. This is in agreement with recommendations made by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, who also highlight the additional treatment of the surrounding photodamaged skin in case multiple lesions are present. International treatment guidelines list photodynamic therapy as the “gold standard” for treating actinic keratosis, especially multiple actinic keratoses and the surrounding photodamaged skin3.
 
Market Overview for Treatment of Actinic Keratosis
 
Actinic keratosis is a disease that is most frequent in the Caucasian, light-skinned population. Only a fraction of these patients is currently being treated. Actinic keratoses are treated using a wide range of methods. The traditional methods of treating actinic keratoses are:

● | cryotherapy, or the deep freezing of skin; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | simple curettage; 
● | self-applied topical prescription products; and 
● | Healthcare Personnel (HCP) – applied medication combined with light therapy (photodynamic therapy). 

 
While any one of these treatment options can be effective, each has specific limitations and side effects.
 
Cryotherapy is non-selective; this means it cannot target specific tissues and affects all tissues in the area of application. Cryotherapy can be painful at the site of freezing and can cause blistering and loss of skin pigmentation, leaving temporary or permanent white spots. In addition, there is no standardized treatment protocol with Cryotherapy, thus, the results are not uniform and can depend on the skill or technique of the healthcare provider treating the patient. 
 
Simple curettage is generally most useful for one or a few individual lesions, but not for a large number of lesions, and it leaves permanent scars.
 
Topical prescription products such as 5-fluorouracil cream requires twice-a-day application by the patient for approximately 2 to 4 weeks, resulting in inflammation, redness and erosion or rawness of the skin. Following the treatment, up to several weeks of healing may be required. Imiquimod or diclofenac, other topical prescription products, require extended applications of cream, lasting up to 3 or 4 months, during which the skin is often very red and inflamed. Tirbanibulin is a recent FDA-approved topical (12/2020) with shorter treatment and less irritation, yet lower disease clearance rates. With all topical products, even those with a relatively short course of treatment, patient compliance remains an issue, as many patients discontinue treatment once the skin irritation begins.
 
Markets and competitive landscape
 
The United States is the largest market for our flagship product Ameluz® in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp series. According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, actinic keratosis (“AK”) affects approximately 58 million people in the United States.4 In 2021, an estimated 13.2 million treatments for actinic keratosis were performed. In the United States, the most common treatment for actinic keratosis remains cryotherapy, with approximately 11.4 million procedures performed in 2021 and an 86.4% market share. Topical drugs for the treatment of AK took a market share of about 11.8% in the reporting year, followed by PDT drugs at 1.8%. Simple curettage is generally not used to treat actinic keratosis in the United States. The 2021 AK market has grown 4% over 2020.

The chart below displays the relative percentages of these actinic keratosis treatments:
 

The overall market, or total number of AK treatments, declined in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, we saw a cumulative 12.2% decline from 2019 levels. Rising infection rates and the associated official recommendation by the American Academy of Dermatology to provide patients with remote diagnosis and treatment whenever possible led to significantly declining patient numbers and widespread, albeit temporary, closures of physicians’ offices. In 2021, the total AK market grew by 4%. The PDT market grew at the same rate as the AK market; however, Ameluz® grew at 9%. The market share within the PDT drug segment for Ameluz® was 25.6%, compared to approximately 24.5% in the previous year. Biofrontera was able to improve our market position versus the competing PDT drug despite the lingering effects of the pandemic on dermatology patient office visits.
 
The chart below shows the relative percentages of the PDT market share:




Our goal is to continue to improve the market positioning of Ameluz® to become the leading PDT drug for the treatment of AK in the United States. In addition, we see the opportunity to expand the PDT market as a therapy for the treatment of actinic keratosis as the first option compared to cryotherapy, especially in patients with more than 15 lesions. We believe dermatologists have favored cryotherapy to treat actinic keratosis because of a favorable reimbursement regime; however, we believe that there is treatment guideline pressure towards field-directed therapy (as opposed to single lesion therapy), which may also help support sales of photodynamic therapy treatments.
 
The primary competing PDT drug in the United States is Levulan®, which has been approved for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses of the face or scalp in combination with PDT with a blue light source since 1999. Levulan® was the only FDA-approved product on the U.S. market for the PDT treatment of actinic keratosis (in accordance with the applicable prescribing information) until our company launched Ameluz® in the United States in October 2016 (Galderma sold Metvix® in the U.S. market only for a short period and withdrew the product in 2013).
 
In addition, in August 2017, the Ameluz Licensor agreed with the FDA on the requirements for the potential approval of its application to extend Ameluz® PDT for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma in the United States. See “—Our Licensors’ Research and Development Programs—Current Clinical Trials for Ameluz® for the U.S. Market”. If the Ameluz Licensor obtains FDA approval for such label extension, we expect that Ameluz® would be at that time the only drug in the United States approved for the indication of treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma with PDT. Under the Ameluz LSA, we would have the exclusive license to market Ameluz® PDT in the United States for such indication.
 
We expect that our ability to compete in the PDT-market will be based upon such factors as:
 

● | the efficacy from treatment with Ameluz® photodynamic therapy; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the recurrence rates from treatment with Ameluz® photodynamic therapy; 


8
-


● | the ease of administration of our formulation for photodynamic therapy; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the ability of our drug to provide both lesion-and field-directed treatment; 
● | the cost of our drug and the type and cost of our photodynamic therapy light device; 
● | the number of required doses; 
● | the cosmetic outcome and improvement of skin impairment; and 
● | our continued efforts to develop further indications. 

 
Based on the above market and competitive analysis, we believe there is substantial market potential and room for growth in the U.S. and we believe that this data provides the best information available to us relating to the present market for actinic keratosis treatments in the United States. We also base our business planning activities on these data.
 
Xepi®
 
As described in the section “—Commercial Partners and Agreements—Ferrer Internacional S.A.”, the acquisition of Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc. in March 2019 has enabled Biofrontera Inc. to market an FDA-approved drug that had been recently introduced in the U.S. market. Xepi® (ozenoxacin cream, 1%) is a topical prescription medicine approved for the treatment of impetigo, a common skin infection caused by bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes). Xepi® acts by blocking the action of two enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication: DNA-gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Because of this dual mechanism of action, Xepi® is believed to show a low tendency to induce resistant bacteria. Currently, no antibiotic resistance against Xepi® is known. It has been specifically approved by the FDA also for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The approved indication is the topical treatment of impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes in adult and pediatric patients 2 months of age and older.
 
Impetigo is a common and highly contagious bacterial skin infection caused by bacteria. The bacteria that can cause impetigo include Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. It occurs most frequently in children 2 to 5 years old, but people of any age can be affected. Impetigo causes red sores that most often appear on the face, neck, arms, and legs. These sores can turn into blisters that open and form a yellowish crust. Transmission of the disease is by direct contact and poor hygiene can increase the spread. Anyone can get impetigo, and they can get it more than once. Although impetigo is a year-round disease, it occurs most often during the warm weather months.5 There are more than 3 million cases of impetigo in the United States every year.5
 
Possible complications of impetigo6 can include:
 

● | Worsening or spreading of the infection 
--+------------------------------------------------
● | Scarring, which is more common with ecthyma 

 
Impetigo caused by beta-hemolytic strep bacteria can cause:
 

● | Kidney damage (poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
● | Fever, joint, and other problems (rheumatic fever) 

 
Although impetigo rarely leads to serious complications, effective treatment with drugs like Xepi® can shorten how long impetigo lasts.

Treatment decisions should consider resistance pattern of Staphylococcus aureus as antibiotic ineffectiveness resulting from bacterial resistance makes infections more difficult to control, worsens prognosis, and increases healthcare costs. Increasing resistance to known antibiotics is a serious concern for doctors. The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. The cost of resistance to our economy and health system is significant. In a 2009 study titled “Hospital and Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistant Infections in a Chicago Teaching Hospital: Implications for Antibiotic Stewardship,” 13.5% of patients had antimicrobial resistance resulting in a 6.5% attributable mortality rate and a per patient incremental cost of $100,000 per resistant infection. If impetigo spreads to a community, it may also trigger the spread of resistant strains, such as MRSA, with poor prognoses for patients over time. According to the FDA, 90% of MRSA community acquired infections present as skin and soft tissues infections, whereby patients infected with MRSA are 64% more likely to have complications than those infected with the non-resistant forms. In the US 78% of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections are due to MRSA.3
 
Market and competitive landscape
 
The market for topical antibiotics is driven by generics with mupirocin being the top choice of topical antibiotics across all specialties.
 
In 2021, over 13 million prescriptions were written for mupirocin for a range of conditions. According to prescription data from IQVIA, dermatologists account for approximately 12% of the annual topical antibiotic prescriptions written or about 1.4 million prescriptions.
 
The chart below displays the utilization of mupirocin by specialty in 2021:
 


Considering the above market analysis, we believe there is a considerable growth potential for Xepi®. 
 
Our Licensors’ Research and Development Programs
 
We are a sales organization with focus on commercializing our portfolio of licensed products that are already FDA-approved. Research and development efforts for label extensions in order to optimize the market positioning of the products are the responsibility of the respective licensor and are governed by the respective LSAs. Currently, there are no clinical trials being conducted for Xepi®.
 
However, in the future, we may conduct our own clinical trials to better the market positioning of Ameluz and increase our revenue potential. Any clinical trials we conduct for indications that are sought as part of the current clinical trials described below in “Current Clinical Trials for Ameluz® for the U.S. Market” would require the approval of and close collaboration with the Biofrontera Group.

Current Clinical Trials for Ameluz® for the U.S. Market
 
Phase III study for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC)
 
In August 2017, the Ameluz Licensor agreed with the FDA on the requirements necessary to obtain approval for our application of Ameluz® PDT for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma in the U.S. Under the Ameluz Licensor’s agreed plan with the FDA, the application could be based on a single additional Phase III placebo-controlled pivotal trial to be conducted in the U.S., in which Ameluz® PDT will be compared to placebo PDT. The Ameluz Licensor will be required to present as primary clinical endpoint a combined read-out of clinical and histological clearance. In December 2017, the Ameluz Licensor submitted an investigational new drug application with the FDA for the proposed Phase III study protocol to evaluate Ameluz® PDT for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma, and the FDA performed a special protocol assessment.
 
Following the discussion with the FDA, the Ameluz Licensor initiated a study with the primary objective of comparing the efficacy of Ameluz® PDT with PDT using just the vehicle that is used to deliver the active ingredient in Ameluz®, in combination with BF-RhodoLED® illumination, in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma. A randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled multicenter Phase III study is being performed by the Ameluz Licensor to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz® in combination with the BF-RhodoLED® lamp. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the safety and secondary efficacy parameters (including stratification according to lesion size, location, patient age and sex) related to Ameluz® in combination with the BF-RhodoLED® lamp, also including clinical clearance of additional treated lesions on the same patients. The double-blind clinical observation period for each patient will be up to 7 months (up to four weeks screening and pre-randomization period, and three or six months double blind part of the study) followed by a 5-year follow-up period after the start of the last PDT cycle. The recruitment phase started in the third quarter of 2018. Due to the study protocol mandated by the FDA, the recruitment process has taken and will likely take a considerable amount of time. As of now over 73% of the patients have been recruited. A total of 18 clinical sites are currently participating in the study.
 
Phase I safety study evaluating PDT with three tubes of Ameluz®
 
In December 2021, the Ameluz Licensor commenced patient enrollment for its Phase I safety study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PDT for the treatment of mild-to-severe AK on the face and scalp using three tubes of Ameluz® together with the new RhodoLED® XL lamp. The non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluates the safety and tolerability of Ameluz® in the treatment of AK located on the face and scalp with PDT together with the new RhodoLED® XL lamp. The study includes 100 patients with mild to severe AK. Each patient will receive the content of three tubes of Ameluz® for a field-directed treatment of AK. A total of eight clinical sites are participating in the study.
 
The Phase I study follows a maximal-usage pharmacokinetics (“PK”) clinical study that was completed in October 2020 and the results were submitted to the FDA in early 2021. The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of patients after applying three tubes of Ameluz® to the skin by investigating the amount of active ingredient that enters the blood stream. Further parameters related to the safety of patients undergoing such treatment were also investigated. The FDA acknowledged the results of the PK study. However, the regulatory agency subsequently requested another safety study focusing on transient adverse events before amending the product information, which currently limits use to one tube of Ameluz® per treatment.

Phase II study for the treatment of moderate to severe acne
 
In December 2021, the Ameluz Licensor started patient recruitment for the phase IIb study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ameluz® in combination with the PDT-lamp BF-RhodoLED for the treatment of moderate to severe acne with Ameluz®-PDT.
 
The multicenter, randomized, double blind phase II study with four arms uses conventional Ameluz®-PDT and includes 126 adult patients suffering from moderate to severe acne, who will be treated with Ameluz®-PDT or placebo. Efficacy and safety of Ameluz®-PDT will be tested with respect to incubation periods of one and three hours compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is the absolute change in the number of inflammatory lesions and an improvement in symptoms. To ensure collection of highly consistent data across all participating sites, the study will combine clinical assessments performed by the physicians conducting the study with a cutting-edge, FDA-approved, artificial intelligence analysis platform that will provide a lesion count along with a severity assessment. A total of seven sites are participating in the study.
 
Sales, marketing and distribution
 
We are currently selling our portfolio of licensed products in the United States through the use of our own commercial organization. We have a single sales force who markets all our licensed products across the dermatology space.
 
We launched the commercialization of Ameluz® in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp for the treatment of actinic keratosis in the United States in October 2016. Prior to launch, and with the help of a consulting firm specializing in market access, we analyzed the reimbursement mechanisms for photodynamic therapy in the U.S. healthcare system. Ameluz® is distributed as a “buy-and-bill” drug that is purchased by the dermatologist, rather than distribution through pharmacies.
 
Based on our experience, we concluded that we could most effectively market our products by using our own sales force, which we train to sell our drug Ameluz® (in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp series) and Xepi®. During 2016, we hired 26 employees for our U.S. marketing and sales efforts, and we launched the commercialization of Ameluz® and RhodoLED® lamp for actinic keratosis in the U.S. in October 2016.
 
Since then, we have continued to build our organization in the United States, added the FDA-approved prescription drug Xepi® to our portfolio in March 2019 and, as of December 31, 2019, we had over 70 employees in our salesforce and field based supporting functions in the medical and reimbursement field. However, due to measures and regulations implemented by governments worldwide in an attempt to control the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reduced demand for our products that this caused, we had to reduce our U.S. workforce in March 2020 and implemented a mandatory furlough program, under which all employees were required to take temporary periods of unpaid time off. As of December 31, 2020, we had 56 employees. We have since re-filled the key positions for our U.S. operations with qualified and experienced employees. As of December 31, 2021, we have 69 employees of which 35 are sales positions including management. We are considering additional expansion of our sales and office staff as we expand our commercial footprint.
 
We centralize our customer sales support and back-office functions through our headquarters in Woburn, Massachusetts. We use Cardinal Health as our third-party logistics partner for warehousing and distribution. To mitigate risk of business interruption, product is stored and shipped from two warehouses, either La Verne, Tennessee or Reno, Nevada, depending on geographical ship-to locations. We intend to continue our development of our sales and marketing infrastructure to effectively target the broad range of dermatologic prescribers. To further our development, we plan to expand our headcount, increase our investment in market research and brand development, further develop our distribution capabilities and explore broader payer relationships and coverage.
 
Significant Customers
 
At December 31, 2021, no customer represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no customer represented more than ten percent of net revenues.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any patents or trademarks. We license the rights and trademarks related to the products we sell. See “—Commercial Partners and Agreements” for more information regarding the terms of our license agreements for Ameluz® and Xepi®.
 
The patent family that protected the technology relating to the combination of a nanoemulsion with 5-aminolevulinic acid, the active ingredient in Ameluz®, against copying by competitors expired on November 12, 2019. This patent family included U.S. Patent No. 6,559,183, which, prior to its expiration, served as a material, significant and possibly the only barrier to entry into the U.S. market by generic versions of Ameluz®. Although the process of developing generic topical dermatological products presents specific challenges that may deter potential generic competitors, Patent No. 6,559,183 no longer prevents generic versions of Ameluz® from entering the U.S. market and competing with Ameluz®. Other patents have therefore been filed by Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience, and two granted, to further protect the combination of Ameluz® and RhodoLED®.
 
Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series are approved by the FDA as a combination product, such that the label requires the use of both products together. In our opinion, this requirement would also hold true for any generic manufacturer, who would have to develop and market their own combination product consisting of a generic version of Ameluz® and a generic version of the RhodoLED® lamp series.
 
In December 2021, Biofrontera Pharma received two notices of allowance from the USPTO. The formal patents referenced below have subsequently been granted at the beginning of 2022.
 
The first patent grant refers to the patent application “Illumination for Photodynamic Therapy” (US17/234,490), an innovative, pain-reducing illumination protocol for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The patent application claims a method for photodynamic therapy in which a dynamic and innovative illumination protocol is implemented. This protocol consists of changing illumination intensities combined in a predefined order with interruptions of the illumination to specifically modulate and reduce pain perception for the patient. As implementation of the patented invention to Biofrontera’s medical devices merely requires the installation of a software, it can potentially be rolled-out to both BF-RhodoLED® and RhodoLED® XL.
 
The second patent grant refers to the patent application “Illumination device for photodynamic therapy, method for treating a skin disease and method for operating an illumination device” (US 17/215,785), which protects a number of innovations in the recently FDA-approved RhodoLED® XL lamp. The patent application describes specific features of the LED arrays of the five panels constituting the lamp head of the RhodoLED® XL. The patent further describes the implementation of a distance sensor in each panel that improves positioning of the device: The sensors are connected to visual feedback mechanisms that support the operator in properly positioning all five panels at the recommended treatment distance. This increases standardization of the illumination and should contribute to patient safety, while improving handling of the lamp for the treating physician. The FDA has acknowledged the relevance of this patent on the lamp also for Ameluz® by allowing its inclusion in the Orange Book as a patent protecting Ameluz®.
 
In order to protect the recently FDA-approved RhodoLED® XL red-light lamp against imitations, a design application for certain key design aspects of the lamp was also filed as a continuation-in-part application of the previously mentioned patent on October 19, 2021.
 
An international patent application “Photodynamic therapy comprising two light exposures at different wavelengths” was filed with the EPO on August 23, 2018. Entry into the regional/national phases was initiated for the EU, USA, Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Singapore, and examination requests were made in each case.
 
The Ameluz ® Licensor furthermore holds a patent family (which is licensed to us for commercialization in the United States through the Ameluz LSA) protecting the technology relating to nanoemulsions. This patent has been issued to Biofrontera Bioscience in several other jurisdictions, including Australia, Belarus, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa, Singapore, Ukraine, and with the European Patent Office (validated in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, France, and Italy). The anticipated expiration date of these international patents is December 21, 2027. Ameluz® is dependent on the nanoemulsion technology described in this patent. A corresponding U.S. patent application has been filed by Biofrontera Bioscience but is still pending. We cannot guarantee that this U.S. patent will be issued or, if issued, will adequately protect us against copying by competitors.

Commercial Partners and Agreements
 
Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience
 
On June 16, 2021, we entered into the Ameluz LSA with Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience. Under the terms of the Ameluz LSA, we were granted an exclusive, non-transferable license to use Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience technology to use, import, export, distribute, market, offer for sale and sell Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series for its approved indications within the United States and certain of its territories.


Under the terms of the Ameluz LSA as entered into on June 16, 2021, we agree to purchase from the Ameluz Licensor a minimum number of units of Ameluz® per year according to an agreed schedule at fifty percent of our anticipated net price per unit for Ameluz®. On October 8, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Ameluz LSA under which the price we pay per unit will be based upon our sales history, although the minimum number of units to purchase per year remains unchanged. As a result of this amendment, the purchase price we pay the Ameluz Licensor for Ameluz® will be determined in the following manner:
 

● | fifty percent of the anticipated net price per unit until we generate $30 million in revenue from sales of the products we license from the Ameluz Licensor during a given Commercial Year (as defined in the Ameluz LSA); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | forty percent of the anticipated net price per unit for all revenues we generate between $30 million and $50 million from sales of the products we license from the Ameluz Licensor; and 
● | thirty percent of the anticipated net price per unit for all revenues we generate above $50 million from sales of the products we license from the Ameluz Licensor. 

 
The amendment to the Ameluz LSA that became effective on October 8, 2021, also shifted the costs of clinical development for FDA-approved indications that are not currently being sought by the Ameluz Licensor, as described below.
 
In addition, under the Ameluz LSA, the Ameluz Licensor agrees to sell us the RhodoLED® lamp series at cost plus a low-double digit handling fee. There are no milestone or royalty obligations associated with this agreement. Any changes to pricing of supply of Ameluz® or RhodoLED® lamps would require agreement by both contract parties.
 
The Ameluz LSA will remain in effect until June 2036, at which time the Ameluz LSA may automatically renew depending on Biofrontera’s achievement of certain revenue goals. Both parties may terminate the agreement early for a material breach after a 60-day cure period.
 
The Ameluz LSA also provides that we will indemnify the Ameluz Licensor, subject to certain conditions, for any claims related to a breach of our representations and covenants under the agreement or any other gross negligent, willful or intentionally wrongful act, error or omission on our part. Under the terms of the agreement, the Ameluz Licensor will indemnify us, subject to certain conditions, against claims related to the licensed products.

Under the Ameluz LSA, the Ameluz Licensor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the rights to all FDA approvals (and any required maintenance thereafter) needed for the Ameluz Licensor to manufacture Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp series and/or for Biofrontera to sell Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp series in the United States. Likewise, the Ameluz Licensor is responsible to maintain a pharmacovigilance database and to respond appropriately to all relevant queries of any regulatory authority pertaining to pharmacovigilance (Biofrontera is required to provide reasonable support relating to any regulatory issues relating to pharmacovigilance and/or product recalls). Furthermore, the Ameluz Licensor will in agreement with Biofrontera perform and finance clinical trials to promote the Ameluz® market positioning in the U.S. market for indications that are identified in the amendment signed on October 8, 2021, including the clinical studies described in “—Our Licensors’ Research and Development Programs—Current Clinical Trials for Ameluz® for the U.S. Market” above. With respect to the indications currently pursued by the Ameluz Licensor, we have the authority under the Ameluz LSA, in certain circumstances, to take over clinical development from the Ameluz Licensor, if they are unable or unwilling to perform these functions appropriately and subtract the cost from the transfer price of future shipments. The Ameluz Licensor does not have any obligation under the Ameluz LSA, as amended, to perform or finance clinical trials to promote indications that might be pursued in the future. The pursuit of any additional indications would need to be separately negotiated between us and the Ameluz Licensor.
 
Conversely, under the Ameluz LSA, Biofrontera is responsible for obtaining all state licenses or any other similar approvals required to market Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp in the United States. Biofrontera must also carry out all mandatory reporting responsibilities under federal and state law with respect to compliance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the Sunshine Act, or any other similar laws and regulations. Biofrontera is also responsible for all activities related to reimbursement and pricing of the products within the United States. Biofrontera is required by the Ameluz LSA to use commercially reasonable efforts and resources to exploit the license and market Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp in the United States (“commercially reasonable efforts” being defined in terms of comparison against industry standards and practices for a company of comparable size and capability and active in the same business area).


Under the Ameluz LSA, if product or lamps are not delivered in conformance with certain specifications of this Agreement and the Quality Assurance Agreement, and the Ameluz Licensor does not remedy its failure, then we will have the right to organize manufacturing on our own, and step into contracts with the Ameluz Licensor’s manufacturers, such that we will replace the Ameluz Licensor as a party to these contracts. If we pursue this option, the Ameluz Licensor must use its best efforts to assist with the transferring of these manufacturing contracts without delay and at its own cost. No transfer price will be paid to the Ameluz Licensor thereafter for products or lamps that are manufactured by third parties.


Ferrer Internacional S.A.
 
On March 25, 2019, we assumed the rights, duties and obligations of Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc. under the Xepi LSA as part of the acquisition of Cutanea. Under the terms of the Xepi LSA, we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the United States and certain of its territories, including the right to sublicense under certain conditions, to develop, make, have made, use, register, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import Xepi®.
 
Under the Xepi LSA, we are obligated to make payments to Ferrer upon the occurrence of certain milestones. Specifically, we must pay Ferrer (i) $2,000,000 upon the first occasion when annual net sales of Xepi® under the Xepi LSA exceed $25,000,000, and (ii) $4,000,000 upon the first occasion annual net sales of Xepi® under the Xepi LSA exceed $50,000,000. The maximum potential milestone payments remaining under this agreement total $6,000,000. These are both sales-based milestones. There are no development milestones within the agreement.
 
The terms of the Xepi LSA also provide for us to purchase Xepi® from Ferrer and pay royalties at a high single digit percentage based on net sales. Royalties are paid quarterly when the related sales occur. There are no other performance obligations required for royalties to be incurred. Furthermore, while Ferrer is approval holder for Xepi®, the administration of the NDA managed by Biofrontera Bioscience. We are fully dependent on our collaboration with Ferrer for our supply of Xepi® from their sole supplier.
 
The Xepi LSA will continue for the longer of (a) 12 years following the first commercial sale of Xepi® or (b) 12 years from the date of latest product to launch under the Xepi LSA, concluding in 2030. However, the Xepi LSA will automatically terminate concurrently with the termination of Ferrer’s license with Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., also in 2030. Ferrer covenants under the agreement to make commercially reasonable efforts to extend its license agreement with Toyama. Although recent developments with respect to the third-party manufacturer that was providing our supply of Xepi® have impacted the timing of sales expansion and improved market positioning, we believe that Xepi® has the potential to be another innovative product with a large market potential in our portfolio. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates —Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment” in this Form 10-K.
 
Under the Xepi LSA, Biofrontera is required to obtain and maintain all “Marketing Authorizations and Regulatory Approvals” in Ferrer’s name, as well as to obtain and maintain all other licenses and certificates required for the wholesale and/or retail sale of Xepi® in the United States. Biofrontera must also participate in a “Joint Steering Committee,” which is intended, in part, to ensure (among other things) that Biofrontera uses commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell Xepi® in the United States. This joint steering committee is required to meet at least once per year, unless agreed otherwise by the parties.

Government Regulation

Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, labeling, packaging, distribution, record keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, sale, export and import, pricing (including discounts and rebates), and the reporting of safety and other post-market information of the products we distribute. These laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions and could result in harm to our reputation and business. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance.
 
U.S. Drug Development and Review
 
Drug Development Process
 
General Information about the Drug Approval Process and Post-Marketing Requirements
 
The U.S. system of new drug and biologics approval is a rigorous process. The following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities undertaken by our Licensors.
 
Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”): After certain pre-clinical studies are completed, an IND application is submitted to the FDA to request the ability to begin human testing of the drug or biologic. An IND becomes effective thirty days after the FDA receives the application (unless the FDA notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold), or upon prior notification by the FDA.
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trials: These trials typically involve small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients and usually define a drug candidate’s safety profile, including the safe dosage range.
 
Phase 2 Clinical Trials: In Phase 2 clinical trials, controlled studies of human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug’s effectiveness. These studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels, dose schedules and route(s) of administration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic on humans, as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans to expand the safety profile following Phase 1. These clinical trials, and Phase 3 trials discussed below, are designed to evaluate the product’s overall benefit-risk profile, and to provide information for physician labeling.
 

16
--

 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials: This Phase usually involves a larger number of patients with the targeted disease. Investigators (typically physicians) monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate’s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long-term use of the drug on a large, more widespread, patient population. During the Phase 3 clinical trials, typically the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease.
 
NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”): After completion of all three clinical trial Phases, if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective, an NDA or BLA is filed with the FDA requesting FDA approval to market the new drug as a treatment for the target disease.
 
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Authority under the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (“FDAAA”): The FDAAA also gave the FDA authority to require the implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) for a product when necessary to minimize known and preventable safety risks associated with the product. The FDA may require the submission of a REMS before a product is approved, or after approval based on “new safety information,” including new analysis of existing safety information. A REMS may include a medication guide, patient package insert, a plan for communication with healthcare providers, or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the product, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product. A REMS must include a timetable for submission of assessments of the strategy at specified time intervals. Failure to comply with a REMS, including the submission of a required assessment, may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties.
 
Other Issues Related to Product Safety: Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval also can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, under the FDAAA, the FDA has authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information derived from clinical trials, post-approval studies, peer-reviewed medical literature, or post-market risk identification and analysis systems data.
 
Clinical trials may experience delays or fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy, which could prevent or significantly delay obtaining regulatory approval.
 
Clinical trials require the investment of substantial financial and personnel resources. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by various factors, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, failure of patients to complete the clinical trial, delays in accumulating the required number of clinical events for data analysis, delay or failure to obtain the required approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, and shortages of available drug supply. Moreover, the outcome of a clinical trial is often uncertain. There may be numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the results of early-stage clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that a drug product is safe and effective despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Clinical trial data results are susceptible to varying interpretations, and such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA. The ability to commence and complete clinical trials may be delayed by many factors that are beyond our licensors control, including:
 

● | delays obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with contract research organizations (“CROs”) and clinical trial sites; 
● | delays in obtaining institutional review board (“IRB”), approval at each site; 
● | slower than anticipated patient enrollment or an inability to recruit and enroll patients to participate in clinical trials for various reasons; 
● | inability to retain patients who have initiated a clinical trial; 
● | lack of funding to start or continue the clinical trial, including as a result of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional trials and studies; 
● | negative or inconclusive results; 
● | deficiencies in the conduct of the clinical trial, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, good clinical practice, or clinical protocols; 
● | deficiencies in the clinical trial operations or trial sites resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold; or 
● | adverse medical events or side effects experienced by patients during the clinical trials as a result of or resulting from the clinical trial treatments; 


17
--

 

Delays can also occur if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated the IRBs of the clinical trial sites in which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose a suspension or termination of the clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, or failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug.
 
Post-Approval Requirements for Approved Drugs
 
Any of our licensed drug products that require FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other requirements, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval. We are relying exclusively on our licensors’ or their manufacturing partner’s facilities for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented and development of and submission of data to support the change. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval, as well as, possibly, the development and submission of data to support the change.
 
The FDA also may require post-approval, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product label extensions or products under development.

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation for Medical Devices
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

● | establishing establishment registration and device listings with the FDA; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers and certain other parties, to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation, corrective action/preventive action, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures, as applicable; 
● | labeling statutes and regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, or off-label, uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
● | clearance or approval of product modifications that could affect (or for 510(k) devices, significantly affect) safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change (or for 510(k) devices, a major change) in intended use;

Affordable Care Act
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

● | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic agents from 15.1% of AMP to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010. Per a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012, states have the option to expand their Medicaid programs which in turn expands the population eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In July 2013, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) issued a final rule allowing the newly eligible entities to access discounted orphan drugs if used for non-orphan indications. While the final rule was vacated by a federal court ruling, HRSA has stated it will continue to allow discounts for orphan drugs when used for any indication other than for orphan indications. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 


● | Effective in 2011, the Affordable Care Act imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Affordable Care Act required pharmaceutical manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin tracking this information in 2013 and to report this information to CMS by March 2014. 
● | As of 2010, a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to the Affordable Care Act to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. 
● | The Affordable Care Act created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB, which, beginning in 2014, has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings. IPAB recommendations are only required when Medicare spending exceeds a target growth rate established by the Affordable Care Act. Members of the IPAB have still not been appointed and Medicare cost growth is below the threshold that would require IPAB recommendations.

● | The Affordable Care Act established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | In December 2018, the CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain Affordable Care Act qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the Affordable Care Act risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Effective January 1, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. 
● | Effective January 1, 2020, the federal spending package permanently eliminated the Affordable Care Act-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. 
● | On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act in June 2021. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act. 

Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. In order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs. We also must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures.
 
Sales of our licensed products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our licensed products will be covered by third party payors, such as government health care programs, statutory health insurances, and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services and there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain reimbursement at all for any future products. In addition, the U.S. government (federal and state) has continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, competitive bidding program, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third party reimbursement for our licensed product or product candidates or a decision by a third party payor to not cover our licensed product or product candidates could reduce physician usage of our licensed products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 
In the U.S., treatment of actinic keratosis with Ameluz® in combination with the BF-RhodoLED® lamp is eligible to be reimbursed by the U.S. federal government’s Medicare Program through Part B, which means that dermatologists purchase the drug to treat a patient in their office in combination with the BF-RhodoLED® lamp and the doctors can be reimbursed for the cost of the drug after its use to treat a patient. This differentiates Ameluz® from drugs that are reimbursed through the U.S. federal government’s Medicare Program through Part D, which are distributed through pharmacies. Medicare Part B drugs are reimbursed under the ASP payment methodology. ASP data is calculated based on a formula defined by federal statute and regulation and is submitted to the CMS on a quarterly basis. CMS uses the ASP data to determine the applicable reimbursement rates for Ameluz® under Part B. The Medicare Part B ASP reimbursement for Ameluz® may fall below the cost that some medical providers pay for Ameluz®.

Our prescription drug licensed product, Xepi®, is distributed through specialty pharmacies and generally covered by most commercial payers without pre-approval or similar requirements. Our contracts with third-party payers/pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) generally require us to provide rebates based on utilization by the patients they cover.
 
Government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase, could adversely affect our business if implemented. In the Fall of 2020, the Trump Administration finalized an importation pathway from Canada and a payment model to tie Medicare Part B physician reimbursement to international prices, though ultimate implementation of both is uncertain due to legal challenges. In November 2020, the Trump Administration published an interim final rule to implement the Most Favored Nation Model to lower Medicare Part B drug spending by tying reimbursement to the lowest price paid by certain other countries. In December 2020, implementation of the rule was blocked by federal courts and the Biden administration is expected to withdraw opposition to the injunctions. We expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation under the newly elected Congress and the Biden Administration. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 signed into law by President Biden on March 14, 2021 includes a provision that will eliminate the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. With the elimination of the cap, manufacturers may be required to compensate states in an amount greater than what the state Medicaid programs pay for the drug. In addition, U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products.
 
The majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our products under the Medicaid and Medicare managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies and Medicare contract to provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to control healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcomes. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
We are subject to healthcare anti-fraud and abuse regulations that are enforced by the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

● | the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Law; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | federal false claims laws; 
● | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; and 
● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
 
Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, activities relating to the sale and marketing of products are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for the federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal civil False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
 
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to adopt comprehensive compliance programs. Certain states also mandate the tracking and require reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration paid by us to physicians and other health care providers.
 
Increased Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (OIG) scrutiny on the sale of products through specialty pharmacies or through physician practices by means of direct investigation or by issuance of unfavorable Opinion Letters which may curtail or hinder the sales of our licensed products based on risk of enforcement upon ourselves or our buyers. The OIG continues to make modifications to existing Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, safe harbors which may increase liability and risk for our company as well as adversely impact sales relationships. On November 20, 2020 OIG issued the final rule for Safe Harbors under the Federal AKS. This new final rule creates additional safe harbors including ones pertaining to patient incentives. OIG is able to modify safe harbors as well as regulatory compliance requirements which could impact out business adversely.

In September 2010, OIG issued a Special Advisory Bulletin to notify drug manufacturers that OIG intended to pursue enforcement actions against drug manufacturers that failed to submit timely AMP and ASP information. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order for Medicaid payments to be available for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. Companies with such rebate agreements are required to submit certain drug pricing information to CMS, including quarterly and monthly pricing data. There has been an increased level of federal enforcement against drug manufacturers that have failed to provide timely and accurate pricing information to the government. Since September 2010, OIG has settled 13 cases against drug manufacturers relating to drug price reporting issues, totaling approximately $18.5 million. We expect continued enforcement directed at companies that fail to make accurate and timely price reports. If we were found not to make the required pricing disclosures, we could incur significant expense and delay.  
 
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
 
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
Company History

We were formed in March 2015 as Biofrontera Inc., a Delaware corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Biofrontera AG, a company organized under German law. On November 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 3,600,000 units (each consisting of (i) one share of our common stock and (ii) one warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share) and 540,000 additional warrants not included in the units.
 
As of December 31, 2021, Biofrontera AG held 46.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. We entered into an Amended and Restated Master Contract Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) which provides for the execution of statements of work that will replace the applicable provisions of our previous intercompany services agreement dated January 1, 2016 (the “2016 Services Agreement”) by and among us, Biofrontera AG, Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience, enabling us to continue to use the Biofrontera Group’s IT resources as well as providing access to the Biofrontera Group’s resources with respect to quality management, regulatory affairs and medical affairs. If we deem that the Biofrontera Group should continue to provide these services we will execute a statement of work under the Services Agreement with respect to such services. We currently have statements of work in place regarding IT, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, and investor relations services, and are continuously assessing the other services historically provided to us by Biofrontera AG to determine 1) if they are needed, and 2) whether they can or should be obtained from other third-party providers.
 
Our management team includes Erica Monaco as Chief Executive Officer and Prof. Dr. Lübbert as Executive Chairman. Day-to-day operations are overseen by Ms. Monaco as our Chief Executive Officer, and Prof. Dr. Lübbert’s service as Executive Chairman enables our management team to benefit from his experience.
