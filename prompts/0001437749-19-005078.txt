ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
---------+----------

Overview and History
 
General
 
HomeTown Bankshares Corporation (the “Company”, “HomeTown Bankshares”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia on December 8, 2008. On September 4, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of HomeTown Bank in a one for one exchange of stock.
 
The Company is authorized as a bank holding company. The holding company structure provides greater flexibility than a bank standing alone because it allows expansion and diversification of business activities through subsidiaries or through acquisitions. HomeTown Bankshares Corporation’s business is conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary, HomeTown Bank.
 
On October 1, 2018, the Company and American National Bankshares, Inc. (“American National”) announced a definitive agreement to combine in a strategic merger (the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into American National (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, the holders of shares of the Company's common stock will receive 0.4150 shares of American National common stock for each share of the Company's common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019, subject to approval of both companies' shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
 
HomeTown Bank
 
HomeTown Bank (the “Bank”) is a Virginia banking corporation headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia. The Bank was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a state chartered bank in 2004 and began banking operations in November 2005. The Bank was organized to engage in general retail and commercial banking business.
 
The Bank opened for business on November 14, 2005 and was capitalized by more than 2,000 shareholders who wanted a new local bank dedicated to customer service. These investors provided the initial customer base and are integral to the success of the Bank. Management believes that the key to the Bank’s success lies in providing Bank customers with personalized service from experienced banking professionals while providing innovative, highly competitive and convenient products and services that meet their banking needs. In 2013 the Bank began operating a mortgage joint venture with another entity. The Bank’s ownership interest in HomeTown Residential Mortgage, LLC is 49%. Due to the marketing support and direction provided by HomeTown Bank to HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC, along with guarantees of warehouse lines of credit used in its operation, the Company is deemed to exercise control of this entity. The ownership interest in HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC not owned by the Company is reported as a Non-Controlling Interest in a Consolidated Subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution that provides varied banking services to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, and larger companies. The Bank provides a full range of services to meet the financial needs of its customers and strives to provide its customers with innovative products while maintaining the prompt response and the high level of service of a community bank. Management believes this operating strategy has particular appeal in the Bank’s market area. Management believes that the combination of local ownership and size allows the Bank to offer services and products specifically tailored to the needs of the community. The Bank’s Principal Office is located at 202 S. Jefferson Street, Roanoke, Virginia. The Bank maintains its primary website at www.hometownbank.com.
 
Principal Products of the Bank
 
The Bank offers a full range of banking services to small and medium-size businesses, real estate investors and developers, private investors, professionals and individuals.  In addition to its main office, the Company has full-service offices in Franklin County, Virginia at Westlake, in the town of Christiansburg, Virginia at 2950 Market Street, in Roanoke County, Virginia at the intersection of Colonial Avenue and Virginia Route 419, in the City of Roanoke, Virginia at 3521 Franklin Road, and in the City of Salem, at 852 West Main Street.
 
Deposit Services. The Bank offers a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks, savings banks and credit unions including checking accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer-term certificates of deposit. From the beginning, the Bank has focused on convenience, innovation, and value. The transaction accounts and time certificates are tailored to the Bank’s market area at rates competitive to those offered in the area. In addition, the Bank offers its customers Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). All deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to the maximum amount allowed by law (generally, $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules). The Bank solicits such accounts from individuals, businesses, and associations and organizations.

The Bank also participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”). CDARS and ICS enable the Bank to offer our deposit customers access to FDIC insurance in amounts exceeding the existing FDIC limit. This permits our institution to better attract and retain large deposits from businesses, nonprofit organizations, individuals and other customers that require an assurance of safety.
 
Lending Services. The Bank also offers a full range of short-to-medium term commercial and personal loans. Commercial loans include both secured and unsecured loans for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements), and purchase of equipment and machinery. Consumer loans and lines of credit include secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education and personal investments. Additionally, the Bank originates fixed and floating-rate mortgage loans and real estate construction and acquisition loans. 
Consumer Residential Mortgage Origination. The Bank has expanded their residential mortgage origination operations over the last few years. Initially, the Bank originated loans as a representative for mortgage companies. Then, in February, 2012, the Bank opened a dedicated mortgage office, on Colonial Avenue, next to the existing branch office.  In 2013 HomeTown Bank entered into a joint venture agreement with a mortgage company as 49% owner of HomeTown Residential Mortgage, LLC. The new entity began operations at the end of 2013, absorbing the Bank’s mortgage office employees and continued working from the Colonial Avenue office. The mortgage office operates under the name HomeTown Mortgage and coordinates the Bank’s existing mortgage services and offers mortgages, refinancing, and other services. In 2016, an additional mortgage banker was hired and is based at the Christiansburg branch in order to better serve the New River Valley market. Loans originated are conforming home mortgages in its market area, as defined below. As part of the Bank’s overall risk management strategy, loans originated and closed by the mortgage office are pre-sold to major national mortgage banking or financial institutions. In addition to creating customer relationships and the opportunity to sell other products and services, the bank receives fee income for this service.
Investment Services. HomeTown Investment Services, Inc., opened in April 2013, provides diverse investment products and financial advisory services to existing and prospective customers. These products and services provide another source of revenue for the Company. Investment and insurance products and services are offered through an unaffiliated entity LPL Financial, Member FINRA/SIPC. HomeTown Investment Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of the Bank. Products and services made available through LPL Financial are not insured by the FDIC or any other agency of the United States and are not deposits or obligations of nor guaranteed or insured by any bank or bank affiliate. These products are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of value.  Revenue from investment services is comprised mostly of fees based upon the market value of the accounts under administration as well as commissions on investment transactions.
Private Banking. At the end of 2015, the Bank began offering personalized banking solutions to work with customers to clarify financial goals and bring together professionals to satisfy their investment, credit and other financial needs. Revenue from private banking management activities is comprised mostly of interest income earned on loans and service charges and fees from deposit products. 
Merchant Card Services. The Bank offers comprehensive payment processing solutions giving businesses the ability to accept all major credit cards, either at a terminal, online, via a mobile device or tablet, or over the phone.
 
Other Services. Other services offered by the Bank include safe deposit boxes, traveler’s checks, and direct deposit of payroll, and social security checks, automatic drafts for various accounts, overdraft protection, check cards, and credit cards. The Bank also has become associated with a shared network of automated teller machines (ATMs) that may be used by Bank customers throughout the world. The Bank intends to introduce new products and services as permitted by the regulatory authorities or desired by the public. The Bank remains committed to meeting the challenges that require technology. The Bank provides its customers with access to the latest technological products, such as internet banking, including on-line bill pay and mobile banking. The services allow customers to handle routine transactions using the internet at the Bank’s website www.hometownbank.com or on their mobile phones.
 
Market Area
 
The Bank’s market area primarily consists of the City of Roanoke, Roanoke County, and the City of Salem, Virginia and contiguous counties, including Botetourt, Bedford, Franklin and Montgomery. Total population in the market area is approximately 450,000. The area is serviced by one daily newspaper, at least 6 weekly, multi-weekly or bi-weekly newspapers and a number of radio and television stations providing diverse media outlets. The City of Roanoke and Roanoke County, the location of three of the Bank’s offices, has the largest population base, with approximately 190,000 persons. The Roanoke market area is diversified by industry groups with services, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, utilities, finance, insurance and real estate. Roanoke is a regional center for banking, medicine and the legal and business professional community. Carilion Clinic, Veterans Affairs, Kroger, and HCA Virginia Health System are among Roanoke’s largest private employers. Other major employers are the local school boards, municipal governments, and universities including Virginia Tech, Roanoke College, and Hollins University.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 97 employees, including 97 full-time equivalent employees. None of its employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and relations with employees are considered positive.
Governmental Monetary Policies
 
The earnings and growth of the Company are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policy by its open market operations in United States government securities, control of the discount rate and establishment of reserve requirements against both member and nonmember financial institutions’ deposits. These actions have a significant effect on the overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits, as well as the rates earned on loans, or paid on deposits. Management of the Company is unable to predict the effect of possible significant changes in monetary policies upon the future operating results of the Company.
Competition
 
The Company competes as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in the Roanoke market area and elsewhere. Many of the Company’s nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern federally insured banks and state regulations governing state chartered banks. As a result, such nonbank competitors may have certain advantages over the Company in providing certain services.
 
Increased competition has come from out-of-state banks through their acquisition of Virginia-based banks and interstate branching, and expansion of community and regional banks into our service areas. Consequently, the Company’s market area is a highly competitive, highly branched banking market. Competition, for loans to individuals, small businesses, and professional concerns, is keen in the Company’s target market, and pricing is important. Most of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than the Company and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services that the Company is not currently providing. Moreover, larger institutions operating in the Roanoke market area have access to borrowed funds at a lower cost than are presently available to the Company. Deposit competition is strong and comes from institutions in the market, U.S. Government securities, private issuers of debt obligations, and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors, among other sources.
 
Cyber Security
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company’s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company’s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect our business.
Supervision and Regulation
 
HomeTown Bankshares Corporation
 
HomeTown Bankshares is a bank holding company organized under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHCA”), which is administered by the Federal Reserve Board. HomeTown Bankshares is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and may be required to furnish additional information pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board is authorized to examine HomeTown Bankshares and its subsidiary.
The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in nonbanking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board has found those activities to be incidental to banking. Bank holding companies also may not acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities. With some limited exceptions, the BHCA requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring or merging with a bank or before acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank unless it already controls a majority of shares.

Virginia State Corporation Commission. All Virginia bank holding companies are required to register with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the “Commission”). HomeTown Bankshares is required to report to the Commission with respect to financial condition, operations and management. The Commission may also make examinations of any bank holding company and its subsidiaries.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) permits significant combinations among different sectors of the financial services industry, allows for expansion of financial service activities by bank holding companies and offers financial privacy protections to consumers. GLBA preempts most state laws that prohibit financial holding companies from engaging in insurance activities. GLBA permits affiliations between banks and securities firms in the same holding company structure, and it permits financial holding companies to directly engage in a broad range of securities and merchant banking activities. HomeTown Bankshares is not a financial holding company.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) enacted sweeping reforms of the federal securities laws intended to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. It impacts all companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including HomeTown Bankshares. SOX creates increased responsibilities for chief executive officers and chief financial officers with respect to the content of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Section 404 of SOX and related Securities and Exchange Commission rules focused increased scrutiny by internal and external auditors on HomeTown Bankshares’ systems of internal controls over financial reporting, which is designed to insure that those internal controls are effective in both design and operation. SOX sets out enhanced requirements for audit committees, including independence and expertise, and it includes stronger requirements for auditor independence and limits the types of non-audit services that auditors can provide. Finally, SOX contains additional and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of securities laws. 
Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board adopted risk-based capital guidelines that are applicable to HomeTown Bankshares. The guidelines provide that the Company must maintain a minimum ratio of 8% of qualified total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). At least half of total capital must be comprised of Tier 1 capital, for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4%. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines of 4% for banks that meet certain specified criteria. The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, less intangibles. HomeTown Bankshares is expected to be a source of capital strength for its subsidiary bank, and regulators can undertake a number of enforcement actions against HomeTown Bankshares if its subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. HomeTown Bankshares’ bank subsidiary is well capitalized and fully in compliance with capital guidelines. However, regulatory capital requirements relate to earnings and asset quality, among other factors. Bank regulators could choose to raise capital requirements for banking organizations beyond current levels.
 
On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors approved the final Basel III risk-based capital rule. This rule aims to improve the quality and quantity of capital for all banking organizations and provides a new regulatory framework for U.S. banking organizations which is consistent with international standards. Community banking organizations first became subject to the final Basel III rule on January 1, 2015. Thereafter begins a phase-in period through January 1, 2019. The new rule implements higher minimum capital requirements and emphasizes the use of common equity through the introduction of a new capital ratio: common equity tier 1 (CET1). In addition, the new rule establishes stricter eligibility for capital instruments included in CET1, and additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. The rule introduces the requirement of a new 2.5% capital conservation buffer, to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on January 1, 2019. Banking organizations without other supervisory issues that wish to distribute capital freely, such as in the payment of dividends for example, must maintain the new capital conservation buffer.
 
The new rule emphasizes common equity as the preferred capital instrument and limits the inclusion of intangible assets, including mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets in the capital of financial institutions. The new capital rule addresses the Dodd-Frank Act prohibition on reliance on external credit ratings specified in the regulations of the federal banking agencies. Consequently, the new capital rule replaces the previous credit-rating-based risk-weighting approach of certain assets with a simplified supervisory formula approach.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act The financial regulatory reform legislation “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (the Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act implements financial regulatory reform across the entire financial landscape and has far-reaching provisions including among other things:

• | Creates a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. As a smaller institution, most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Company by the Federal Reserve Board and to the Bank by the FDIC.

• | Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminates the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund and increases the floor of the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requires loan originators to retain 5 percent of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a “qualified residential mortgage”, which must still be defined by the regulators. Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Affairs and Rural Housing Service loans are specifically exempted from the risk retention requirements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implements corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Makes permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increases the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. While the Company is not directly subject to these rules for as long as the Company’s assets do not exceed $10 billion, the Company’s activities as a debit card issuer may be indirectly impacted, potentially requiring the Company to match new lower fee structures implemented by larger financial institutions in order to remain competitive.

The Dodd-Frank Act is the largest piece of financial legislation ever passed, exceeding 2,000 pages in length. Many provisions of the Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers, or the financial industry as a whole. Provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees are likely to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate.
 
HomeTown Bank
 
The Bank is under the supervision of, and subject to regulation and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission. The Bank is also covered by deposit insurance through the FDIC and is subject to their regulations. As such, the Bank is subject to various statutes and regulations administered by these agencies that govern, among other things, required reserves, investments, loans, lending limits, acquisitions of fixed assets, interest rates payable on deposits, transactions among affiliates and the Bank, the payment of dividends, mergers and consolidations, and establishment of branch offices.
 
Deposit Insurance. HomeTown Bank has deposits that are insured by the FDIC. The FDIC maintains a Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) that is funded by risk-based insurance premium assessments on insured depository institutions. Assessments are determined based upon several factors, including the level of regulatory capital and the results of regulatory examinations. The FDIC may adjust assessments if the insured institution’s risk profile changes or if the size of the DIF declines in relation to the total amount of insured deposits. It is anticipated that assessments will increase in the future due to the anticipated growth of the Bank.
 
On April 1, 2011, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which also requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depositary institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amounts for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.
 
Capital Requirements. The same capital requirements that are discussed above with relation to HomeTown Bankshares are applied to HomeTown Bank by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Board guidelines provide that banks experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions well above minimum levels, without reliance on intangible assets. Also, capital requirements can be increased based on earnings and asset quality concerns as well as other issues.

Mergers and Acquisitions. With some limited exceptions, the BHCA requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring or merging with a bank or before acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank unless it already controls a majority of shares. The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to permit adequately capitalized and adequately managed bank holding companies to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of an out-of-state bank or bank holding company, subject to certain conditions, including nationwide and state concentration limits. Banks also are able to branch across state lines, provided certain conditions are met, including that applicable state law must expressly permit such interstate branching. Virginia law permits branching across state lines, provided there is reciprocity with the state in which the out-of-state bank is based. 
Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). The Company is also subject to the requirements of the CRA. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. Each financial institution’s efforts in meeting community credit needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to a number of assessment factors. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches.
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests over certain thresholds in private equity and hedge funds. Final rules implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted on December 10, 2013. The final rules require entities to establish internal compliance programs which may include making regular reports about those activities to regulators. The final rules were effective April 1, 2015, with full compliance being phased in over a period which ended on July 21, 2016.  The Volcker Rule has been subject to much commentary from the banking industry and the Company continues to evaluate the impact the Rule will have on the industry and the Company in particular.
Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” all such terms are defined under uniform regulations defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies.
 
Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. The activities and equity investments of FDIC insured, state-chartered banks are generally limited to those that are permissible for national banks. Under regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not directly or indirectly acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a limited partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. In addition, an insured state-chartered bank may not, directly, or indirectly through a subsidiary, engage as “principal” in any activity that is not permissible for a national bank unless the FDIC has determined that such activities would pose no risk to the insurance fund of which it is a member and the bank is in compliance with applicable regulatory capital requirements. Any insured state-chartered bank directly or indirectly engaged in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank must cease the impermissible activity.
 
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Applicable banking laws include substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions, including the filing of misleading or untimely reports with regulatory authorities, may provide the basis for enforcement action.
 
USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act became effective on October 26, 2001, and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. Among other provisions, the USA Patriot Act permits financial institutions, upon providing notice to the United States Treasury, to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government concerning activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists’ activities. Interim rules implementing the USA Patriot Act were issued effective March 4, 2002. The USA Patriot Act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions. 
 
Consumer Laws and Regulations. There are a number of laws and regulations that regulate banks’ consumer loan and deposit transactions. Among these are the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. HomeTown Bank is required to comply with these laws and regulations in its dealing with customers.
