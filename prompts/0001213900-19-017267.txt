These devices primarily serve the following clinical specialties: neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, wound care and maxillo-facial surgery.
 
In the United States, our products are marketed primarily through a hybrid sales approach. This includes predominately direct sales representatives, managed by regional sales managers, along with independent distributors in areas where we chose not to use direct sales personnel.
 
Outside the United States, we sell our products to specialty distributors who purchase products from us to resell to their clinical customer bases. We sell to all major markets in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa.
 
Pending Acquisition of Solsys Medical, LLC
 
On May 2, 2019, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement with Solsys Medical, LLC, or Solsys, a privately held regenerative medical company, to acquire Solsys in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $97 million, based on the value of our common stock as of May 2, 2019. The planned acquisition of Solsys is expected to substantially broaden Misonix’s addressable market through wound care solutions that are complementary to its existing products. Under the terms of the agreement, a new holding company will issue approximately 5.7 million new shares of common stock to Solsys unitholders and current Misonix shareholders will have their shares of the Company’s common stock converted into shares of the holding company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. After the completion of the transaction, it is expected that Misonix shareholders immediately prior to the closing will own approximately 64% of the holding company, and Solsys unitholders will own approximately 36%. Misonix will also assume Solsys’ outstanding secured debt, with an expected balance of approximately $20 million, upon closing. In addition, the holding company’s Board of Directors will consist of five members: Thomas Patton, Stavros Vizirgianakis, and Gwen Watanabe, who are currently serving as directors of Misonix, and Mr. Michael Koby and Mr. Paul LaViolette who are currently serving as directors of Solsys.
 
The transaction has been approved by both the Misonix Board of Directors and the Solsys Board of Managers. The completion of the acquisition and the issuance of the holding company’s shares in connection with the proposed transaction is subject to the approval by Misonix shareholders and the completion of the transaction is subject to approval by 55% of Solsys’ Series E unitholders and a majority of its Common unitholders, Series A unitholders, Series B unitholders, Series C unitholders and Series D unitholders, voting as a single class, as well as the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. We have scheduled a special shareholder meeting for September 26, 2019 at 10:00 am at the Company’s office to allow our shareholders to vote on the transaction and other related matters. We anticipate that the transaction will close in the third quarter of calendar 2019.

Products
 
All Misonix disposables function with proprietary consoles which essentially convert electrical current into ultrasonic energy via piezo electric crystals in order for the relevant device to produce a therapeutic effect.
Nexus
 
Nexus is a next-generation integrated ultrasonic surgical platform that combines all the features of our existing solutions, including BoneScalpel, SonicOne and SonaStar, into a single fully integrated platform that will also serve to power future solutions. The Nexus platform is driven by a new proprietary digital algorithm that results in more power, efficiency and control. Nexus uniquely has RF capabilities, allowing for use in general surgery procedures. The device also incorporates Smart Technology that allows for easier setup and use.
 
Nexus’ increased power improves tissue resection rates for both soft and hard tissue removal making it a unique surgical platform for a variety of different surgical specialties. In addition, Nexus’ ease of use will enable physicians to fully leverage Nexus’ impressive set of capabilities via its digital touchscreen display and smart system setup. Our current ultrasonic applications; BoneScalpel, SonaStar and SonicOne all work on the Nexus generator. This allows a hospital to access all of our product offerings on this all in one console. Nexus received FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2019 and received its CE mark approval in July 2019 for sale in Europe. We have begun a limited release of Nexus in the United States.
 
BoneScalpel
 
The BoneScalpel is a state of the art, ultrasonic bone cutting and sculpting system capable of making precise cuts with minimal necrosis, minimal burn artifact, minimal inflammation and minimal bone loss. The device is also capable of preserving surrounding soft tissue structures because of its unique ability to differentiate soft tissue from rigid bone. This device can make precise linear or curved cuts, on any plane, with precision not normally associated with powered instrumentation. The BoneScalpel offers the speed and convenience of a powered instrument without the dangers associated with conventional rotary devices. The effect on surrounding soft tissue is minimal due to the elastic and flexible structure of healthy tissue. This is a significant advantage in anatomical regions like the spine where patient safety is of primary concern. In addition, the linear motion of the blunt, tissue-impacting tips avoids accidental ‘trapping’ of soft tissue while largely eliminating the high speed spinning and tearing associated with rotary power instruments. The BoneScalpel allows surgeons to improve on existing surgical techniques by creating new approaches to bone cutting and sculpting and removal, leading to substantial time savings and increased operation efficiencies.
 
SonaStar
 
The SonaStar System provides powerful precise aspiration following the ultrasonic ablation of hard or soft tissue. The SonaStar has been used for a wide variety of surgical procedures applying both open and minimally invasive approaches, including neurosurgery and liver surgery. The SonaStar may also be used with OsteoSculpt ® probe tips, which enable the precise shaping or shaving of bony structures that prevent open access to partially or completely hidden soft tissue masses.
 
SonicOne
 
The SonicOne Ultrasonic Cleansing and Debridement System is a highly innovative, tissue specific approach for the effective removal of devitalized or necrotic tissue and fibrin deposits while sparing viable, surrounding cellular structures. The tissue specific capability is, in part, due to the fact that healthy and viable tissue structures have a higher elasticity and flexibility than necrotic tissue and are more resistant to destruction from the impact effects of ultrasound. The ultrasonic debridement process separates devitalized tissue from viable tissue layers, allowing for a more defined treatment and, usually, a reduced pain sensation. We believe SonicOne establishes a new standard in wound and burn bed preparation, the essential first step in the healing process, while contributing to a faster patient healing.

License and Other Agreements
 
On October 19, 2017, we entered into a License and Exclusive Manufacturing Agreement, or the Agreement, with Hunan Xing Hang Rui Kang Bio-technologies Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation, or Hunan, under which we licensed certain manufacturing and distribution rights to our SonaStar product line in China, Hong Kong and Macau, or the Territory, in exchange for payments totaling at least $11,000,000.
 
Pursuant to the Agreement, Hunan is obligated to pay we: (i) initial amounts consisting of upfront fees and stocking orders totaling $5,000,000, payable in five (5) equal monthly installments of $1,000,000 each; (ii) royalty payments from the sale of SonaStar products in the Territory, including minimum royalty payments of $2,000,000 per calendar year in each of 2019, 2020, and 2021; and (iii) reimbursement of technology transfer costs in an amount up to $1,000,000. The Agreement also provides that Misonix will supply SonaStar products to Hunan at agreed prices during the transition period prior to Hunan’s commencement of manufacturing.
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, we delivered the licensed SonaStar technology to Hunan, and recorded license revenue of $4,010,000. In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2018, we had delivered the contractually agreed number of SonaStar units to Hunan and had recorded product revenue of $990,000. Hunan had paid all of the $5 million of initial payments to us as of March 31, 2018. No royalty payments had been made as of June 30, 2019.
 
In October 1996, we entered into a license agreement with Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (“MMIT”). The MMIT license covered the further development of our medical technology relating to vessel sealing products, which uses high frequency sound waves to coagulate and divide tissue for both open and laparoscopic surgery. We developed the AutoSonix product with MMIT under the agreement. As a result of this joint development, we co-own certain patents with MMIT and MMIT paid us a 5% royalty on end user sales. The MMIT license gives MMIT exclusive worldwide marketing and sales rights for this technology and device. Total royalties from sales of this device worldwide were approximately $0 and $525,000, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The royalty payments are recorded as “other income” in our financial statements. Our license agreement with MMIT expired in August 2017 and no further payments are due thereafter.
 
We sold our rights to the high intensity focused ultrasound technology to SonaCare Medical, LLC, or SonaCare, in May 2010. Under the terms of the sale agreement, SonaCare was obligated to pay us up to approximately $5.8 million. SonaCare is obligated to pay us 7% of the gross revenues received from its sales of the (i) prostate product in Europe and (ii) kidney and liver products worldwide, until we have received payments of $3 million, and thereafter 5% of the gross revenues, up to an aggregate payment of $5.8 million, all subject to a minimum annual royalty of $250,000. Fiscal 2019 and 2018, payments were $0 and $250,000, respectively, bringing cumulative payments through June 30, 2019 to $2,542,579. SonaCare defaulted on its royalty payment of $250,000 due on March 31, 2019, and we are in discussions with SonaCare regarding this default.
 
Customers
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, one customer, Zhong Mei Medical Limited, accounted for 11.5% of our revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, one customer, Hunan, accounted for 15.8% of our revenue.
Research & Development
 
As of June 30, 2019, our research and development organization consisted of a staff of 10 employees including engineers, technical and support personnel. The in-house technical expertise includes mechanical engineering, acoustics, electrical engineering, software development and product design. The research and development group focuses principally on developing new products and supporting existing products. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we were developing our Nexus next generation surgical platform, including seeking regulatory approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, resulting in higher research and development expenditures in the current fiscal year. Nexus received FDA 510(k) clearance in June 2019.

During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred R&D expenses of $4.5 million and $4.4 million, or 11.5% and 12.0% of revenue, respectively.
 
Revenue by Region
 
Our revenues are generated from various regions throughout the world. Our sales outside the United States are made through distributors. Our sales made in the United States are made primarily through our direct sales force and some distributors. The following is an analysis of net sales from continuing operations by geographic region:

 | For the years ended June 30, | | Net Change | 
--------------+-------------------------------+------------+------------+--

Our international sales include a concentration in China, aggregating $4.6 million and $7.0 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Fiscal 2018 international sales include $4.0 million of license revenue.
 
Manufacturing and Supply
 
We largely manufacture and assemble our medical device products at our production facility located in Farmingdale, New York. Our products include components manufactured by other companies in the United States. We are dependent upon some single source of supply, and are actively working to develop multi-sourced suppliers. We do not have long-term supply agreements. We may encounter difficulty in obtaining materials, supplies and components adequate for our anticipated short-term needs.
Competition
 
Competition in the medical device products industry is rigorous. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, value-added solutions, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors. The speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of our products to the market are therefore important competitive factors. We compete with many companies having more significant capital resources, larger research laboratories and more extensive distribution systems than we do. Some of our major competitors are Medtronic, Anspach, Johnson & Johnson, Integra Life Sciences, Inc., Söering, Stryker Corporation and Smith and Nephew.
Regulatory Requirements
 
Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are also subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad.
United States
 

The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping of medical devices in order to ensure that those sold in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts and criminal prosecution.

Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require manufacturers, including our third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions.
 
We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 
Our labeling and promotional activities in the U.S. are also subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
International
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.
 
EEA
 
In the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the Essential Requirements laid out in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA.
 
- 5 -

 

All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. Where appropriate, our products commercialized in Europe are CE marked and classified as either Class I or Class II.
 
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication in May 2020.
 
Other Regulatory Bodies
 
Our devices are sold in multiple other countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the National Medical Products Administration in China, Health Canada in Canada, the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, and the Agência Nacional de Vigilância in Brazil.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws. The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA. The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from processing, offering, or making payments of money or anything of value to foreign officials with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. In certain countries, the health care professionals we or our distributors regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants and agents, including distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence.
 
ISO Standards
 
We also operate and maintain a Quality Management System which complies with the requirements of International Standards ISO 13485: 2012 + AC:2012, Health Canada CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003, and US 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation. This system encompasses the principle of enhancing customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for control, monitoring, and continual improvement, which is designed to insure that we consistently meet or exceed customer expectations and applicable statutory/regulatory requirements.

Trademarks, Patents, and Copyrights
 
Patents, trademarks and other intangible proprietary rights are essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and overseas for patentable subject matter in our products and also attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others.
 
We currently own 60 U.S. patents and 49 foreign patents. In addition, we have 23 pending U.S. patent applications and 73 pending foreign patent applications. Patents relating to our Nexus product are scheduled to expire in 2028. Other patents that we consider important to our business will expire from 2025 to 2036, although we do not currently believe that the expiration of other patents will have a material effect on our business.
 
We also hold 13 trademarks protecting the Misonix name and our product names.
 
We will continue to seek patent, trademark, and copyright protections as we deem advisable to protect the markets for our products and to support our research and development efforts.
 
Backlog
 
As of June 30, 2019, our backlog (firm orders that have not yet been shipped) was approximately $900,000 as compared to $210,000 as of June 30, 2018. We ship most of our products on a just in time basis, which results in low levels of backlog. However, the backlog at June 30, 2019 was higher than normal due to various stock shortages.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, we employed a total of 125 full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
