ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL 
Business Development Corporation of America (“BDCA,” or the “Company,” which may also be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).
We were incorporated in Maryland in May 2010 and commenced our initial public offering (the “IPO”) on January 25, 2011. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2.5 billion of total assets. 
We are externally managed by our investment adviser, BDCA Adviser, LLC (the “Adviser”), a subsidiary of Benefit Street Partners LLC (“BSP”), a leading credit-focused alternative asset management firm. We believe we benefit from the significant investment platform, personnel, scale and resources of our Adviser and BSP. Our investment activities are managed by the Adviser, and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of the Adviser and its affiliates. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle-market companies. We define middle market companies as those with annual revenues up to $1 billion, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions. As of December 31, 2018, 81.2% of our portfolio was invested in senior secured loans.
Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in priority of payments and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. We may also invest in the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation investment vehicles (“Collateralized Securities” or “CLOs”). For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, please see the discussion under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.
We co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order we received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), with certain of our affiliates. See “Material Conflicts of Interests” below. We believe that such co-investments afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification.
ABOUT OUR ADVISER AND BSP
BDCA Adviser, LLC, our investment adviser, is served by BSP’s origination, investment and portfolio management team. In total, BSP consists of over 100 investment professionals and over 200 total employees as of February 28, 2019. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Adviser is a subsidiary of BSP, which is also registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
BSP is a leading credit-focused alternative asset management firm with over $26 billion in assets under management as of January 31, 2019. Established in 2008, the BSP platform manages funds for institutions and high-net-worth investors across various credit funds and complementary strategies, including private/opportunistic debt, structured credit, high yield, special situations, long-short liquid credit, and commercial real estate debt. These strategies complement each other as they all leverage the sourcing, analytical, compliance, and operational capabilities that encompass BSP’s robust platform.
Our investment committee consists of Thomas Gahan, Chief Executive Officer of BSP, Michael Paasche, Senior Managing Director of BSP, and Blair D. Faulstich, Senior Portfolio Manager for Private Debt, each with over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry and substantial experience in originating, underwriting and structuring credit investments. 
MARKET OPPORTUNITY 
We believe that there exists a unique opportunity for BDCs with experience in investing in middle market companies. In our view, middle market companies provide attractive current yields and significant downside protection.
Our current opportunity is highlighted by the following factors:

• | Large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support private investments. We believe there remains a large pool of uninvested private equity capital available to middle market companies. We expect that private equity firms will be active investors in middle market companies and that these private equity firms will seek to supplement their equity investments with senior secured and mezzanine debt and equity co-investments from other sources, such as us.

• | Consolidation among commercial banks has reduced their focus on middle market businesses. The commercial banks in the United States, which have traditionally been the primary source of capital to middle market companies, have experienced consolidation, loan losses, and stricter regulatory scrutiny, which has led to a significant tightening of credit standards and substantially reduced loan volume to the middle market. Many financial institutions that have historically loaned to middle market companies have failed or been acquired, and we believe that larger financial institutions are now more focused on syndicated lending to larger corporations and are allocating capital to business lines that generate fee income and involve less balance sheet risk. We believe this market dynamic provides us with numerous opportunities to originate new debt and equity investments in middle market companies.


• | Refinancing activities will provide continued opportunities to extend capital to middle market companies. A significant volume of senior secured and mezzanine debt is expected to come due over the next several years. As companies seek to refinance their debt, we believe this will create new financing opportunities for us.


• | Lower default rates and higher recovery rates in the middle market. Default rates remain relatively low, with generally higher recovery rates in the middle market. Middle market companies are generally over-equitized as compared to large cap companies.


• | Favorable Pricing Environment in the Loan Market. Lower valuation levels in certain situations, combined with reduced liquidity in the secondary loan market, have created opportunities to acquire relatively high yielding senior and subordinated debt, both secured and unsecured, at potentially attractive prices.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured debt investments and mezzanine debt issued by middle market companies. 
We have adopted the following business strategy to achieve our investment objectives:

• | Utilize the experience and expertise of the principals of our Adviser and BSP. Certain principals of our Adviser and BSP have a broad network of contacts with financial sponsors, commercial and investment banks and leaders within a number of industries that we believe produce significant proprietary investment opportunities outside the normal banking auction process.


• | Focus on middle market companies with stable cash flow. We believe that middle market lending is less competitive than the broadly syndicated loan market, and this is one factor that allows us to negotiate favorable investment terms. Such favorable terms include higher debt yields, more significant covenant protection and greater equity participation than typical of transactions involving larger companies. We generally invest in established companies with positive cash flow. We believe these companies possess better risk-adjusted return profiles than newer companies that are building management expertise or in the early stages of building a revenue base. These middle market companies represent a significant portion of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investment to grow their businesses.


• | Employ disciplined underwriting policies and rigorous portfolio management. We employ an extensive underwriting process that includes a review of the investment memo, competitive position, financial performance and industry dynamics of each potential portfolio company. In addition, we perform substantial due diligence on potential investments, and seek to invest with management teams and/or private equity sponsors who have proven capabilities in building value. As part of the monitoring process for portfolio companies, our Adviser analyzes monthly (if available), quarterly, and annual financial statements versus the previous periods and year, reviews financial projections, and may perform other procedures including meeting with management, attending board meetings and reviewing compliance certificates and covenants.


• | Focus on long-term credit performance and principal protection. We structure our customized loan investments on a relatively conservative basis with high cash yields, security interests (preferably first lien) where possible, cash origination fees, and appropriate leverage levels. We seek strong deal protection for our customized debt investments, including default penalties, information rights, board observation rights, and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. We believe these protections reduce our risk of capital loss.


• | Diversification. We seek to diversify our portfolio broadly among companies in a multitude of different industries, thereby reducing the concentration of credit risk in any one company or sector of the economy. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this effort.

DEAL ORIGINATION
Our Adviser and BSP have extensive relationships with private equity firms, competing lenders, loan syndication and trading desks, management teams, investment bankers, and other persons who we believe will continue to provide us with significant investment opportunities. We believe these relationships provide us with competitive advantages over other BDCs.
From time to time, we may receive referrals for new prospective investments from our portfolio companies as well as other participants in the capital markets.
INVESTMENT SELECTION
We strive to structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral that we can reasonably obtain while seeking to achieve our expectations for total returns on investments. We seek to structure our debt investments so that they often are collateralized by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. We seek to tailor the terms of our debt investments to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. A substantial source of our return is monthly or quarterly cash interest that we collect on our debt investments.
Our investment philosophy and portfolio construction involves:

• | Company-specific research and analysis; and


• | An emphasis on capital preservation, low volatility, diversification and minimization of downside risk.

The foundation of our investment philosophy is intensive credit investment analysis. We follow a rigorous selection process based on:

• | A comprehensive analysis of company creditworthiness, including a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the company’s business;


• | An evaluation of the management team and support from equity investors;


• | An assessment of the competitive landscape;


• | An analysis of business strategy and long-term industry trends; and


• | An in-depth examination of capital structure, financial results and financial projections.

We seek to identify those companies exhibiting superior fundamental risk-return profiles with a particular focus on investments with the following characteristics:

• | Established companies with a history of positive and stable operating cash flows. We seek to invest in established companies with sound historical financial performance. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability.


• | Ability to exert meaningful influence. We target investment opportunities in which we will be the lead investor where we can add value through active participation. Our focus is typically on first lien investments.


• | Experienced management team. We will require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also seek to invest in companies that have a strong equity incentive program in place that properly aligns the interests of management with such company’s investors.


• | Strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages. We seek to invest in companies with proven products and/ or services and strong regional or national operations.


• | Diverse customer bases and product offerings. We seek to invest in companies with diverse customer bases and product offerings.

While we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in companies, not all of these criteria will be met by each company in which we invest.
INVESTMENT STRUCTURE 
Once we have determined that a company is suitable for investment, we work with its management and its other capital providers to structure our investment in the company. We negotiate among these parties to agree on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other capital in the company’s capital structure. We structure our investments as described below. 
First Lien Loans.  When we structure investments in senior secured loans, we obtain security interests in the assets of the company as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral may take the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the company.
3

Second Lien Loans.  We structure these investments as junior, secured loans. We obtain security interests in the assets of the company as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral may take the form of second priority liens on the assets of the company.
Subordinated Loans.  We structure these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with current interest income. Subordinated loans rank senior only to a company’s equity securities and rank junior to all of such company’s other indebtedness in priority of payment. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest) in the early years. Subordinated loan investments are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. In addition, the PIK feature of many subordinated loans, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, increases credit risk exposure over the life of the loan.
Warrants and Minority Equity Securities.  In some cases, we may purchase minority equity interests or receive
nominally priced warrants or options to buy a minority equity interest in the company in connection with a loan. This can allow us to achieve additional investment return from an equity interest. We may structure such warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a “put,” or right to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events.
INTENSIVE CREDIT ANALYSIS/DUE DILIGENCE
The disciplined process through which we make investment decisions with respect to a customized financing transaction involves extensive research into the target company, its industry, its growth prospects and its ability to withstand adverse conditions. If the investment team responsible for the transaction determines that an investment opportunity should be pursued, we engage in an intensive due diligence process. Though each transaction involves a somewhat different approach, the regular due diligence steps generally to be undertaken may include:

• | Meeting with senior management to understand the business more fully and evaluate the ability of the senior management team;


• | Checking management backgrounds and references;


• | Performing a detailed review of financial performance, earnings and potential for earnings growth;


• | Commissioning a quality of earnings report;


• | Visiting the headquarters and conducting other on site diligence;


• | Contacting customers and vendors to assess both business prospects and industry practices;


• | Conducting a competitive analysis, and comparing the company to its main competitors;


• | Researching industry and relevant publications to understand industry wide growth trends;


• | Assessing asset value and the ability of physical infrastructure and information systems to handle anticipated growth;


• | Investigating legal risks and financial and accounting systems;


• | Engaging third party experts and consultants to assist in the due diligence process; and


• | Building detailed projected financial models with an emphasis on downside scenarios.

PORTFOLIO MONITORING
With respect to customized financing transactions, our Adviser monitors our portfolio companies to determine if each company is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company.
We employ several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and value of our investments, which may include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | Assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;


• | Regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;


• | Attendance at and participation in board meetings of the portfolio company (if available); and


• | Review of monthly (if available), quarterly, and annual financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company.

PORTFOLIO ASSET QUALITY
Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.

Loan Rating | Summary Description 
1 | Debt investment exceeding fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since the time of investment are favorable. 
2 | Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments are initially rated a “2”.
3 | Performing debt investment requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 
4 | Underperforming debt investment. Some loss of interest or dividend expected, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 
5 | Underperforming debt investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. 

Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.
The weighted average risk ratings of our investments based on fair value were 2.23 and 2.32 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had eight portfolio companies, which represented fourteen portfolio investments, on non-accrual status with a total principal amount of $171.4 million, amortized cost of $117.4 million, and fair value of $43.8 million. These amounts represented 5.7%, 4.7% and 1.9% of our investment portfolio's total principal, amortized cost and fair value, respectively. We are currently evaluating potential value recovery alternatives for these investments. As of December 31, 2017, we had four portfolio companies, which represented eight portfolio investments, on non-accrual status with a total principal amount of $120.2 million, amortized cost of $97.6 million, and fair value of $21.0 million. These amounts represented 4.0%, 3.8% and 0.8% of our investment portfolio's total principal, amortized cost and fair value, respectively.
The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: 

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017

DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Adviser, acting pursuant to delegated authority from, and under the oversight of our board of directors, assists the board of directors in its determination of the net asset value (“NAV”) of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. In connection with that determination, our Adviser facilitates the preparation, through the use each quarter of independent valuation firms, portfolio company valuations using relevant inputs, including but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts.

We classify the fair value measurements of our assets and liabilities into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Adviser undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

• | Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by the Adviser, with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors or as noted below, with respect to investments in an investment fund;


• | The independent valuation firm(s) conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and


• | The board of directors determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser and independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable).

Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”) refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. Below is a description of factors that our board of directors may consider when valuing our debt and equity investments.
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to determine the fair value of the security. If determined to be readily available, we use the quote obtained.
Investments without a readily available market quotation are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process.
For an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value, we measure the fair value of the investment predominately based on the net asset value per share of the investment fund if the net asset value of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of ASC Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, as of our measurement date.
For investments in Collateralized Securities, the Adviser models both the assets and liabilities of each Collateralized Securities' capital structure. The model uses a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate cash flows from the assets, and distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on priority of payments. The cash flows are discounted using rates that incorporate risk factors such as default risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk, among others. In addition, the Adviser considers broker quotations and/or comparable trade activity is considered as an input to determining fair value when available.

DETERMINATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OFFERINGS
Although we are no longer offering shares of our common stock in a continuous public offering, we may, from time to time, elect to issue shares of our common stock in private placements. We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from selling our shares of common stock at an offering price, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, that is below our net asset value per share unless we obtain prior board of directors and stockholder approval. On May 19, 2017, we received stockholder approval to sell shares of our common stock in an amount not to exceed 25% of our then-outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale at a price below our then-current NAV, subject to certain conditions. In connection with any issuance of our common stock, our board of directors or a committee thereof review the then current offering price per share, if available, against the current estimated net asset value per share to ensure that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, was below our net asset value per share. If shares are to be sold at a price below our net asset value per share pursuant to shareholder approval thereof, then a majority of our directors who have no financial interest in the sale and a majority of such directors who are not interested persons of us or the Adviser have determined that any such sale would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders.
In reviewing our offering price in connection with any closing, the board of directors or a committee thereof expects to consider the following factors, among others, in making such determination: 

• | the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC;


• | our Adviser’s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of net gains on the sale of our portfolio investments) from the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value to the period ending two days prior to the date of the closing on and sale of our common stock; and


• | the magnitude of the difference between the net asset value disclosed in the most recent periodic report we filed with the SEC and our Adviser’s assessment of any material change in the net asset value since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value, and the offering price of the shares of our common stock at the date of closing.

Importantly, this determination requires that we calculate net asset value per share within 48 hours of each closing. In addition, it involves a determination by the board of directors or a committee thereof that we are not selling shares at a price that, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, is below the then current net asset value per share at the time at which the sale of shares is made. To the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may issue shares of our common stock at a price which, after deducting selling commissions and dealer manager fees, is below the then current net asset value per share, the board of directors or a committee thereof will elect either to postpone the closing until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to change the offer price.
These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. We record all determinations described in this section, and these records are maintained with other records we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act.
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory and Management Services Agreement, as amended (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), our Adviser oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio.
Prior to February 1, 2019, our Adviser provided investment advisory and management services under the investment advisory and management services agreement, effective November 1, 2016, (the “Prior Investment Advisory Agreement”) and most recently re-approved by the Board in August 2018. The terms of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement were materially identical to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Prior Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminated on February 1, 2019 upon the indirect change of control of the Adviser on the consummation of Franklin Resources, Inc.’s (“FRI”) and Templeton International, Inc.’s (collectively with FRI, “Franklin Templeton”) acquisition of BSP (the “FT Transaction”). The Investment Advisory Agreement was approved by stockholders at a special meeting held on January 11, 2019, and took effect February 1, 2019. For additional information regarding the FT Transaction, please see the section entitled “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments”.
Responsibilities of the Adviser 
Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, our Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. Under the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser, among other things:

• | Determines the composition and allocation of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes in our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | Identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;

7


• | Executes, monitors and services our investments;


• | Determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain, or sell;


• | Performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and


• | Provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.

Our Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and they are free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as their services to us are not impaired.
Compensation of the Adviser
Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement and for the investment advisory and management services provided thereunder, we pay our Adviser a base management fee and an incentive fee.
Base Management Fee
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our average gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Average gross assets are calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter is deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as the Adviser will determine. However, any deferred base management fee must be taken within three calendar years of the date on which such fee was first payable by us. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately pro-rated.
Incentive Fees
The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is referred to as the incentive fee on income and it is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding quarter. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the administration agreement with BSP and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The payment of the incentive fee on income is subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter, expressed as a quarterly rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.75% (7.00% annualized), subject to a “catch up” feature (as described below). The calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:

• | No incentive fee on income is payable to the Adviser in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.75%, or 7.00% annualized (the “Preferred Return”), on net assets;


• | 100% of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized) is payable to the Adviser. This portion of our incentive fee on income is referred to as the “catch up” and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) in any calendar quarter; and


• | For any quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875% (8.75% annualized), the incentive fee on income equals 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved.

The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the “incentive fee on capital gains during operations,” is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on liquidated investments from the portfolio during operations prior to our liquidation and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, if earlier). This fee equals 20.0% of our incentive fee capital gains, which equals our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees.
Payment of our expenses
All investment professionals and staff of the Adviser and BSP, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to

such services (including health insurance, 401(k) plan benefits, payroll taxes and other compensation related matters), are provided and paid for by the Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including (without limitation) fees and expenses relating to: 

• | expenses deemed to be “organization and offering expenses” of the Company for purposes of Conduct Rule 2310(a)(12) of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA;


• | amounts paid to third parties for administrative services;


• | amounts paid to third party experts relating to the investigation and monitoring of our investments;


• | the cost of calculating our net asset value;


• | the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;


• | management and incentive fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement;


• | fees payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making investments and valuing investments (including third-party valuation firms);


• | transfer agent and custodial fees;


• | fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts (including attendance at investment conferences and similar events);


• | federal and state registration fees;


• | any exchange listing fees;


• | federal, state, and local taxes;

• | stockholders’ reports and notices;


• | costs of preparing government filings, including periodic and current reports with the SEC;


• | fidelity bond, liability insurance and other insurance premiums;


• | printing and mailing; and


• | independent accountants and outside legal costs.

We reimburse the Adviser for all of our expenses incurred by the Adviser as well as the actual cost of goods and services used for or by us and obtained from entities not affiliated with the Adviser. The Adviser may be reimbursed for the administrative services performed by it on our behalf; provided, however, the reimbursement shall be an amount equal to the lower of the Adviser’s actual cost or the amount we would be required to pay third parties for the provision of comparable administrative services in the same geographic location; and provided, further, that such costs are reasonably allocated to us on the basis of assets, revenues, time records or other method conforming with generally accepted accounting principles. No reimbursement shall be permitted for services for which the Adviser is entitled to compensation by way of a separate fee.
Duration and termination 
The Adviser serves as our investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was approved by our shareholders effective February 1, 2019. Unless terminated earlier, it will remain in effect until February 2021 and then continue in effect from year to year if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by us without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice and by the Adviser upon not less that 120 days' written notice. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our board of directors or by vote of our stockholders.
In determining to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our board of directors requested information from the Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, quality and extent of services performed by the Adviser, the Adviser’s ability to manage conflicts of interest effectively, our short and long-term performance, our costs, including as compared to comparable BDCs that engage in similar investing activities, the Adviser’s profitability, any economies of scale, and any other benefits of the relationship for the Adviser. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our board of directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.

Indemnification
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS
On March 18, 2011, we entered into a fund administration servicing agreement and a fund accounting servicing agreement with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the “Administrator”). Our Administrator provides the administrative services, such as accounting, financial reporting, legal and compliance support and investor relations support, necessary for us to operate.
On November 1, 2016, we entered into an administration agreement with BSP (the “Administration Agreement”), pursuant to which BSP provides us with office facilities and administrative services. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, $0.7 million and $0.6 million million was payable to BSP under the Administration Agreement, respectively.
These agreements were not affected by the FT Transaction. 
COMPLIANCE
We, along with our Adviser, have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the federal securities laws, and our board of directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Guy Talarico, our Chief Compliance Officer, is the Chief Executive Officer of Alaric Compliance Services, LLC, and serves as our Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between BDCA and Alaric Compliance Services, LLC.
COMPETITION
Our primary competition in providing financing for acquisitions, buyouts and recapitalizations of middle market companies include other BDCs, public and private buyout and other private equity funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds as well as access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. We use the industry information of the Adviser’s investment professionals, to which we have access, to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that our relationships and those of the Adviser and BSP will enable us to discover, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest.
STAFFING
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. The services necessary for the operation of our business are provided to us by our officers and the employees of our Adviser and BSP and our Administrator pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and the servicing agreements that we have entered into with our Administrator.
REGULATION
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and the affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act also requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.
10

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.” We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
As a BDC, we may be examined periodically by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. Our Adviser is a registered investment adviser and is also subject to examination by the SEC.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Asset Coverage
We are only allowed to borrow money such that our asset coverage, which, as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, with certain limited exceptions. Although Congress passed the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCAA”) on March 23, 2018, which amended the 1940 Act to permit BDCs to incur increased leverage if certain conditions are met, we do not presently intend to avail ourselves of the increased leverage limits permitted by the SBCAA. If we were to avail ourselves of the increased leverage permitted by the SBCAA, this would effectively allow us to double our leverage, which would increase leverage risk and expenses. We may use borrowed funds, known as “leverage,” to make investments and to attempt to increase returns to our stockholders by reducing our overall cost of capital. We currently have credit facilities with Wells Fargo and Citi and have sold $310.0 million in aggregate principal of unsecured notes. 
  Qualifying assets
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. operating companies with listed securities that have equity market capitalizations of less than $250 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:

a. | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;


b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and


c. | satisfies any of the following:


i. | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;


ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;


iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or


iv. | is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million

2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
3.Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if 
11

the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
4.Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
5.Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6.Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Temporary investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Regulation-Qualifying assets” above. BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Indebtedness and Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provision to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements.
Our code of ethics is posted on our website at http://www.bdcofamerica.com and was filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our registration statement. In addition, the code of ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.

Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011, and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our taxable earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.
In order to qualify to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; meet the Annual Distribution Requirement; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies. or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” as defined in the Code (the “90% Income Test”); and diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: (i) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and (ii) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.
Provided that we continue to qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which generally is defined as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year; (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year; and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
We have also formed and expect to continue to form consolidated subsidiaries (the “Consolidated Holding Companies”). These Consolidated Holding Companies enable us to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. See “Regulation” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures that our Adviser follows are set forth below and are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of its clients’ stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions of our Adviser are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
13

You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer, 9 West 57th Street, 49th Floor, Suite 4920, New York, NY 10019.
MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Investment Advisory Agreement 
We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement on February 1, 2019 under which the Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. The Adviser and its affiliates also provide investment advisory services to other funds that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser or sub-adviser to private funds and registered open-end funds, and serves as an investment adviser to a public real estate investment trust. The Adviser’s policies are designed to manage and mitigate the conflicts of interest associated with the allocation of investment opportunities pursuant to the SEC exemptive order. See “Co-Investment Relief”. In addition, any affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates.
Prior to February 1, 2019, our Adviser provided investment advisory services to us pursuant to the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, which was terminated in connection with the FT Transaction. For additional information regarding the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement, please see the section entitled “Item 1. Business - Investment Advisory and Management Services Agreement.” 
Administration Agreement
In connection with the Administration Agreement effective November 1, 2016, BSP provides us with office facilities and administrative services. The Administration Agreement was not affected by the FT Transaction. 
Co-Investment Relief
The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from entering into negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC. The SEC staff has granted us exemptive relief that allows us to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates (“Affiliated Funds”) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
Triangle Transaction
On April 3, 2018, BSP, through its affiliate BSP TCAP Acquisition Holdings LP (the “Acquisition Entity”), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with Triangle Capital Corporation (“Triangle”) under which certain funds advised by BSP agreed to acquire Triangle’s Investment Portfolio (the “Triangle Portfolio”) for $981.2 million in cash, as adjusted in accordance with the terms of the APA (the “Triangle Transaction”). Our Adviser is an affiliate of BSP, and we participated in the Triangle Transaction by purchasing a portion of the Triangle Portfolio, facilitated through the Acquisition Entity.
On July 31, 2018, BSP completed the Triangle Transaction. The gross cash proceeds paid to Triangle were approximately $793.3 million, after adjustments to take into account portfolio activity and other matters occurring since December 31, 2017. In accordance with BSP’s allocation policy, we acquired approximately 24% of the assets in the Triangle Portfolio for an aggregate purchase price of $188.1 million. The final allocation of the investments in the Triangle Portfolio by BSP was based on a number of factors, including, among others, our available capital at the time of allocation, changes in the composition of the Triangle Portfolio between the signing of the APA and the closing of the Triangle Transaction, the suitability of the investments in Triangle’s Portfolio for us as compared to the other funds managed by BSP, regulatory guidance regarding the allocation of certain Triangle Portfolio assets between funds managed by BSP and changes in the relative size of the funds managed by BSP.
Private Placement in connection with FT Transaction
In connection with the FT Transaction, on November 1, 2018, we issued approximately 6.1 and 4.9 million shares of our common stock to FRI and BSP, respectively, at a purchase price of $8.20 per share in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). For additional information regarding the FT Transaction,
