ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
------------+---------

Overview
 
We are a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (“EV”) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. We offer both residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to easily recharge at various location types.
 
Our principal line of products and services is our Blink EV charging network (the “Blink Network”) and EV charging equipment (also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (or EVSE)) and EV related services. Our Blink Network is proprietary cloud-based software that operates, maintains, and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers, and parking companies, who we refer to as our Property Partners, with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations, payment processing, and provides EV drivers with vital station information including station location, availability, and applicable fees.
 
We offer our Property Partners with a flexible range of business models for EV charging equipment and services. In our comprehensive and turnkey business model, we own and operate the EV charging equipment, manage the installation, maintenance, and related services; and share a portion of the EV charging revenue with the property owner. Alternatively, Property Partners may share in the equipment and installation expenses, with us operating and managing the EV charging stations and providing connectivity to the Blink Network. For Property Partners interested in purchasing and owning EV charging stations, that they manage, we can also provide EV charging hardware, site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, and service and maintenance services.
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. As of March 20, 2018, we have approximately 14,165 charging stations deployed of which 4,690 are Level 2 commercial charging units, 113 DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 1,976 residential charging units in service on the Blink Network. Additionally, we currently have approximately 436 Level 2 commercial charging units on other networks and there are also approximately an additional 6,950 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations. The non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations are all partner owned.
 
On February 16, 2018, we closed our underwritten public offering (the “Public Offering”) of an aggregate 4,353,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 8,706,000 shares of common stock at a combined public offering price of $4.25 per unit comprised of one share and two warrants. The Public Offering resulted in approximately $18.5 million of gross proceeds, less underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $4.4 million, a portion of which is included within deferred public offering costs on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $14.1 million. The common stock and warrants were approved to list on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols BLNK and BLNKW, respectively, and began trading on February 14, 2018.
 
Each warrant is exercisable for five years from issuance and has an exercise price equal to $4.25 per share. We granted the Public Offering’s underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 652,950 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase 1,305,900 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. In connection with the closing of the Public Offering, the underwriters have partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased an additional 406,956 warrants.
 
Industry Overview
 
We believe that the market for plug-in electric vehicles has experienced significant growth in recent years in response to consumer demand for vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, greater performance, and with lower environmental emissions. We believe that the demand for EVs has also been spurred in part by federal and state fuel economy standards and other state and local incentives and rebates for EVs. For example, the states of California, Oregon, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts and others have created mandates for EVs with the goal of 3.3 million EVs on the road by 2025. At the same time, oil and gas prices continue to experience spikes and fluctuations, while at the same time the cost of battery technology continues to fall as the battery industry achieves scale. In response, major automotive OEMs have accelerated the adoption of EV models, with more than 25 EV models currently available from Tesla, Nissan, Kia, GM, Ford, Fiat, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Land Rover, Porsche, and many others. According to the Electric Drive Transportation Association, sales of plug-in vehicles since introduction to the market in 2010 is over 500,000 and according to a third-party researcher, sales are expected to grow by a factor of 12 to 2.5 million in 2025.

However, we believe that a major impediment to EV adoption has been the lack of EV charging infrastructure, and that a viable model for continued deployment of EV charging infrastructure continues to evolve. Examples of federal programs designed to stimulate development of EV charging infrastructure includes the recent White House announcement of, among other things, programs to release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities, and the launching of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations.
 
According to Navigant Research, the global market for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) is expected to grow from 505,000 units in 2016 to 2.5 million in 2025. Major utility companies are also working to upgrade their grid infrastructure in order to prepare for mass consumption of electricity by electric vehicles.
 
While many believe that the majority of EV charging occurs at home, we believe the need for a robust, pervasive public EV charging infrastructure is required to eliminate range anxiety (that is, a worried feeling while driving an electric car caused by the driver thinking they might run out of power before reaching their destination). In addition to providing strategic, public charging stations, we believe that it is necessary to provide EV charging solutions to those drivers that do not live in single-family homes, but share parking facilities, including multifamily residential apartment buildings and condominiums. While there are a few, leading competitors and various, smaller EV charging equipment or service providers that have emerged in the market, we believe their products and services are limited. Typically, these companies offer EV charging equipment, an EV charging network, or EV charging services with third party equipment.
 
Our EV Charging Solutions
 
We offer a broad range of EV charging products and services to property partners and EV drivers.
 
EV Charging Products
 

● | Level 2. We offer Level 2 (AC) EV charging equipment, which is ideal for commercial and residential use, and has the standard J1772 connector, which is compatible with all major auto manufacturer electric vehicle models. Our commercial equipment is available in pedestal or wall mount configurations, with the ability to connect to our robust Blink Network. Our non-networked residential product, Blink HQ, is available in a wall-mount configuration and offers a delay start feature that allows users to optimize charging by utility rates. Level 2 charging stations typically provide a full charge in two to eight hours. Level 2 chargers are ideally suited for low-cost installations and frequently used parking locations, such as workplace, multifamily residential, retail and mixed-use, parking garages, municipalities, colleges/schools, hospitals, and airports. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | DCFC. Our DC Fast Charging equipment (“DCFC”) currently has the CHAdeMo connector, which is compatible with Nissan, Kia, and Tesla electric vehicle models (additional models may be potentially available in the future), and typically provides an 80% charge in less than 30 minutes. Installation of DCFC stations and grid requirements are typically greater than Level 2 charging stations, and are ideally suited for transportation hubs and locations between travel destinations. 

 
We intend to enhance our current equipment offerings by developing and offering new generations of EV charging equipment in the second half of 2018. Blink’s next generation of EV charging equipment, which we anticipate will be manufactured by Liteon, offers a modern, stylish appearance, the versatility of both wall and pedestal configurations, and peer-to-peer architecture, which provides the ability to support a single primary charger and multiple secondary chargers. Additionally, the next generation of our EV charging hardware is intended to considerably reduce the current standard charging times within the industry and add new robust Blink Network features, including near-field communication (NFC) payment capabilities.
 
EV Charging Services
 

● | Blink Network. Our proprietary, cloud-based Blink Network allows us to share convenient and advantageous station management features and pertinent data with Property Partners and EV drivers through user interfaces. These features include real-time station status, payment processing, detailed charging session information, monitoring and troubleshooting stations remotely, as well as standard and customized reporting capabilities on, among others, energy dispensed, greenhouse gases reduced, oil barrels saved, and gallons of fuel saved. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Blink Mobile application. Our proprietary mobile application, available for iOS and Android, provides EV drivers with vital station information, including the ability to locate EV charging stations on the Blink Network, view real-time station status information, pay and initiate EV charging sessions, become a Blink member, and manage their Blink account (billing information, radio frequency identification cards, text messaging, and email notifications).

We believe that we are unique in our ability to provide various business models to property partners and leverage our technology to meet the needs of both property partners and EV drivers. Our property partner business model options include:
 

1. | Host Owned: The Property Partner purchases our EV charging equipment for use by EV drivers and pays for connectivity to the Blink Network as well as payment transaction fees. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Blink Owned: We provide EV charging equipment, which we own and maintain, and operate the EV charging services through our Blink Network and share a portion of the revenues generated from the stations with our Property Partner. 
3. | Hybrid: We also offer customized business models that meet individual Property Partner needs and combines features from the aforementioned business models. 

Competitive Advantages/Operational Strengths
 
Early Mover Advantage: We continue to leverage our large and defendable first mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both drivers and Property Partners. We have more than 114,000 drivers currently registered with Blink that appreciate the value of EV charging sessions on a leading, established, and robust network. We have thousands of Blink chargers deployed across the United States and the goal is to keep our Property Partners on one consistent network when expanding on any given property.
 
Long-Term Contracts with Property Owners: We have strategic and often long term agreements with location exclusivity for Property Partners across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, car dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condo, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. Some examples are Caltrans, Carl’s Jr., City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Cracker Barrel, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., Garage Management Company, Icon Parking, IKEA, iPark, JBG Associates, Kohls, Kroger Company, LAZ Parking, Macy’s, McDonald’s, Ralphs Grocery Company, Sears, Simon Properties, and SP+ Parking. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently, or had contracts with the EV service providers that we acquired, including ECOtality, the former owner of the Blink related assets.
 
Flexible Business Model: We are able to offer and sell both EV charging equipment as well as access to our robust, cloud-based EV charging software, which we refer to as the Blink Network. We believe that we have an advantage in our ability to provide various business models to Property Partners and leverage our technology to meet the needs of both Property Partners and EV drivers.
 
Ownership and Control of EV Charging Stations and Services: We own a large percentage of our stations, which is a significant differentiation between us and some of our primary competitors. This ownership model allows us to control the settings and pricing for our EV charging services, service the equipment as necessary, and have greater brand management and price uniformity.
 
Experience with Products and Services of Other EV Charging Service Providers. From our early days and through our acquisitions, we have had the experience of owning and operating EV charging equipment provided by other EV charging service providers, including General Electric, ChargePoint, and SemaConnect. This experience has provided us with the working knowledge of the benefits and drawbacks of other equipment manufacturers and their applicable EV charging networks.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue to be a leading provider of EV charging solutions by deploying mass scale EV charging infrastructure, and by doing so, enable the accelerated growth of EV adoption and the EV industry. Key elements of our strategy include:

● | Relentless Focus on Customer Satisfaction. Increase overall customer satisfaction with new and existing Property Partners and EV drivers by upgrading and expanding the EV charging footprint throughout high demand, high density geographic areas. In addition, improve productivity and utilization of existing EV charging stations, as well as to continue to enhance the valuable features of our EV charging station hardware and the Blink Network. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Leverage Our Early Mover Advantage. We continue to leverage our large and defendable first mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both drivers and Property Partners. We believe that there are tens of thousands of Blink driver registrants that appreciate the value of transacting charging sessions on a leading, established, and robust network experience. We have thousands of Blink chargers deployed across the United States and the tendency, among users, is to stay within one consistent network for expansion on any given property.

● | Expand Sales and Marketing Resources. Our intention is to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure to capitalize on the growth in the market as well as to expand our go-to-market strategy. Today, we use a direct sales force and intend to continue to expand our efforts as well as invest in a wholesale channel go-to-market strategy that may include wholesale electrical distributors, independent sales agents, utilities, solar distributors, contractors, automotive manufacturers, and auto dealers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Continue to Invest in Technology Innovation. We will continue to enhance the product offerings available in our EV charging hardware, cloud-based software, and networking capability. This includes the design and launch of our next generation of EV charging solutions, including accelerating the charge currents currently available in EV charging hardware and new, robust Blink Network features in order to distance ourselves from the competition. Our key service solutions allow us to remain technology agnostic, and if market conditions shift, we have the option to leverage pure play hardware providers to augment our products. 
● | Properly Capitalize Our Business. We continue to pursue and welcome new potential capital sources to deliver on key operational objectives and the necessary resources to execute our overall strategy. The EV charger industry as a whole is undercapitalized to deliver the full potential of the expected EV market growth in the near future. We expect to retain our leadership position with new capital. 

Sales
 
We currently maintain an in-house field sales force that maintains business relationships with our Property Partners and develops new sales opportunities through lead generation and marketing. We also sell our EV charging hardware, software services (connectivity to Blink Network), and service plans through reseller partners, which then sell these products and services to property representatives and/or hosts.
 
Marketing is performed by our in-house staff. To promote and sell our services to property owners and managers, parking companies, and EV drivers, we also utilize marketing and communication channels including press releases, email marketing, website (www.blinkcharging.com), Google AdWords, and social media. The information on our websites is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
 
We continue to invest in the improvement of the service and maintenance of our Company-owned stations, as well as those stations with a service and maintenance plans, and expanding our cloud-based network capabilities. We anticipate continuing to expand our revenues by selling our next generation of EV charging equipment to current as well as new Property Partners, which includes airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations, expanding our sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, auto original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), solar integrators, and dealers, which will include implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), and subscription plans for EV drivers on our Blink-owned public charging locations.
 
Our revenues are primarily derived from fees charged to EV drivers for EV charging in public locations, EV charging hardware sales, and government grants. EV charging fees to EV drivers are based either on an hourly rate, a per kilowatt-hour (“kWh”) rate, or by session, and are calculated based on a variety of factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. EV charging hardware is sold to our Property Partners such as Green Commuter, IKEA, Nashville Music Center, and Wendy’s. In addition, other sources of fees from EV charging services are network fees and payment processing fees paid by our Property Partners.
 
Our Customers and Partners
 
We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotels, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condos, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institutions, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We have hundreds of Property Partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. Some examples are Caltrans, City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Cracker Barrel, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry’s Food & Drug, Inc., IKEA, JBG Associates, LLC, Kroger Company and Ralphs Grocery Company. We continue to establish new contracts with Property Partners that previously secured our services independently, or had contracts with the EV services providers that we acquired, including ECOtality, the former owner of the Blink related assets.

Our revenues are primarily derived from EV charging hardware sales to our Property Partners, fees from public EV charging services to EV drivers, government grants, and marketing incentives. EV charging fees to EV drivers are based either on an hourly rate, a per kWh rate, or by session, and are calculated based on a variety of factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. In addition, other sources of fees from EV charging services are network fees and payment processing fees paid by our Property Partners.

We anticipate continuing to expand our revenues by selling our next generation of EV charging equipment, expanding our sales channels, and implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), subscription plans for our Blink-owned public charging locations, and advertising fees.
 
Competition 
 
The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on the basis of product performance and features, total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability and size of installed base. Our existing competition currently includes ChargePoint, which manufactures EV charging equipment and operates the ChargePoint Network; and EVgo, which offers home and public charging with pay-as-you-go and subscription models. There are other entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market, such as General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect, and Greenlots. We believe these additional competitors struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, the connector type utilized currently restricts the chargers to Tesla vehicles. There are many other large and small EV charger companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage, but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations.
 
We believe we have competitive advantages over our competitors, such as our long-term contracts with property owners and managers, and our flexible business model where we are able to sell both EV charging stations as well provide access to a leading EV charging network. However, many of our current and expected future competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources than we do, and may leverage those resources to compete effectively.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
State, regional, and local regulations for installation of EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, and certifications as examples. Compliance with such regulation(s) may cause installation delays.
 
Currently, we apply charging fees by the kWh for our services in states that permit this policy and hourly and by session for our services in states that do not permit per kWh pricing. California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Washington have determined that companies that sell EV charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities, therefore, allowing us to charge fees based on kW usage. These individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction; however, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms.
 
We intend to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, loans, rebates, subsidies, and incentives as a cost effective means of reducing our capital investment in the promotion, purchase, and installation of charging stations where applicable. We expect that these incentives, rebates, and tax credits will be critical to our future growth. Additionally, there are incentives that are currently offered to support electric car adoption at the federal, state, and local levels, including a $7,500 federal income tax credit, and rebates/credits in California, Colorado, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island.
 
CESQG
 
As a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator (“CESQG”), we generate a limited quantity of hazardous waste, mostly solvent contaminated wipes that are transported to the local solid waste facility. Scrapped electronic boards are transported to a local recycler. A CESQG of hazardous waste is a generator that:

● | Produces no more than 100 kg (220lbs) of hazardous waste per month; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Produces no more than 1 kg (2.2lbs) of acute hazardous waste per month; 
● | Does not accumulate more than 1000 kg(2204lbs) of hazardous waste on-site; and 
● | a CESQG has no time limit for accumulation.

-


The use of our machinery and equipment must comply with the following applicable laws and regulations, including safety and environmental regulations:
 

● | General Safety for all employees- includes health hazard communication, emergency exit plans, electrical safety-related work practices, office safety, and hand and hand-powered tools. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Technicians and Engineers- Only authorized persons (technicians and engineers) perform product testing and repair in the production and engineering areas of the facility. Also, including those engineers involved in field service work. Regulations include control of hazardous energy, and personal protective equipment. 
● | Logisticians- includes forklift operations, which are performed only by certified shipping/receiving personnel, and material handling and storage. 

 
We are in full compliance with the environmental regulations in the General Industry category applicable to us as a CESQG.
 
OSHA
 
We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”). OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. We are in full compliance with OSHA regulations.
NEMA
 
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data. All three of the Company’s products comply with the NEMA standards that are applicable to such products.
 
CAFÉ Standards
 
The regulations mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. Although we are not a car manufacturer and are thus not directly subject to the CAFÉ standards, we believe such standards may have a material effect on our business. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised the fuel economy standards of America’s cars, light trucks, and Sport Utility Vehicles (“SUVs”) to a combined average of at least 35 miles per gallon by 2020—a 10 mpg increase over 2007 levels—and required standards to be met at maximum feasible levels through 2030. Building on the success of the first phase of the National Program, the second phase of fuel economy and global warming pollution standards for light duty vehicles covers model years 2017–2025. These standards were finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Transportation in August 2012. These new standards will reduce average global warming emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks to 163 grams per mile (g/mi) in model year 2025. This is equivalent to 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg), if the standards were met exclusively with fuel efficiency improvements. Manufacturers may choose to comply with these standards by manufacturing more EVs which will mean that more charging stations of the type we manufacture will be needed.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
 
As of April 16, 2018, we had 4 patents issued in the U.S. (in the name of Ecotality, Inc., whose assets we acquired in October 2013). These patents relate to various EV charging station designs. We intend to continue to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. However, our ability to do so may be limited until such time as we are able to generate cash flow from operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in our intellectual property. For example, maintaining patents in the United States and other countries requires the payment of maintenance fees which, if we are unable to pay, may result in loss of our patent rights. If we are unable to do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.

Other Corporate Information
 
Blink Charging Co., a Nevada corporation, is the parent company of Car Charging, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which serves as the main operating company and is, in turn, the parent company of several distinct wholly-owned subsidiary operating companies including, but not limited to, eCharging Stations LLC, Blink, Beam Charging LLC and EV Pass LLC. Car Charging Group, Inc. was formed in the State of Nevada on October 3, 2006, under our prior name, New Image Concepts, Inc. New Image Concepts, Inc. changed its name to Car Charging Group, Inc., on December 8, 2008. On August 17, 2017, Car Charging Group Inc. changed its name to Blink Charging Co. Car Charging, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on September 8, 2009. We purchased the assets referred to as the Blink Network from ECOtality, Inc. on October 16, 2013. From April 22, 2013 to April 16, 2014, 350 Green was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in which the Company had full control and was consolidated. Beginning on April 17, 2014, when 350 Green’s assets and liabilities were transferred to a trust mortgage, 350 Green became a VIE. We determined that we were the primary beneficiary of 350 Green, and as such, 350 Green’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are included in our consolidated financial statements. On May 18, 2017, each of 350 Green and Green 350 Trust Mortgage LLC filed to commence an assignment for the benefit of creditors, which results in their residual assets being controlled by an assignee in a judicial proceeding. As a result, as of May 18, 2017, 350 Green is no longer a VIE of the Company and, accordingly, 350 Green’s approximately $3.7 million of liabilities were deconsolidated from the Company’s financial statements.
 
On January 29, 2018, the Board revised the bylaws of the Company such that the quorum for a meeting of shareholders shall be the holders of thirty-three and 34/100 percent (33.34%) of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote at a meeting.
 
We maintain our principal offices at 3284 N 29th Court, Hollywood, Florida 33020. Our telephone number is (305) 521-0200. Our Silicon Valley office houses our CEO. Our website is www.blinkcharging.com; we can be contacted by email at info@BlinkCharging.com.
