Item 1. Business
Corporate History
C&J Energy Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Successor” and together with its consolidated subsidiaries for periods subsequent to the Plan Effective Date (as defined below), “C&J” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of well construction, intervention, completion, support and other complementary oilfield services and technologies. We provide our services to oil and gas exploration and production companies throughout the continental United States. We are a new well focused provider offering a diverse suite of services throughout the life cycle of the well, including hydraulic fracturing, cased-hole wireline and pumping, cementing, coiled tubing, rig services, fluids management and other completion and well support services. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and operate across all active onshore basins in the continental United States.
We were founded in Texas in 1997 as a partnership and converted to a Delaware corporation (“Old C&J”) in connection with our initial public offering, which was completed in 2011 with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “CJES.” From 2011 through mid-2015, we significantly invested in a number of strategic initiatives to grow our business, including through service line diversification, vertical integration, technological advancement and geographic expansion, including internationally. In 2015, Old C&J combined with the completion and production services business (the “C&P Business”) of Nabors Industries Ltd. (“Nabors”) in a transformative transaction (the “Nabors Merger”) that significantly expanded the Company’s Completion Services and Well Construction and Intervention Services businesses and added the Well Support Services division to the Company’s service offering. Upon the closing of the Nabors Merger, Old C&J became a subsidiary of C&J Energy Services Ltd., a Bermuda corporation (the “Predecessor” and together with its consolidated subsidiaries for periods prior to the Plan Effective Date, the “Predecessor Companies”).
Due to a severe industry downturn, in July 2016, the Predecessor Companies voluntarily filed petitions for reorganization seeking relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, with ancillary recognition proceedings filed in Canada and Bermuda (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”). 
The plan of reorganization (the “Restructuring Plan”) of the Predecessor Companies was confirmed in December 2016, and on January 6, 2017 (the “Plan Effective Date”), the Predecessor Companies substantially consummated the Restructuring Plan and emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding. Pursuant to the Restructuring Plan, effective on the Plan Effective Date, the Predecessor’s equity was canceled, the Predecessor transferred all of its assets and operations to the Successor and the Predecessor was subsequently dissolved. The Predecessor’s common stock was ultimately delisted from the NYSE. On April 12, 2017, the Successor completed an underwritten public offering of common stock and its common stock began trading again on the NYSE under the symbol “CJ.”
Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding, we adopted fresh start accounting ("Fresh Start"). For more information regarding the Chapter 11 Proceeding and adoption of Fresh Start accounting, see Note 14 - Chapter 11 Proceeding and Emergence and Note 15 - Fresh Start Accounting in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”). 
The Successor is the successor issuer to the Predecessor for purposes of and pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, references to “C&J,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report are to the Successor, together with our consolidated subsidiaries when referring to periods following the Plan Effective Date, and to the Predecessor Companies when referring to periods prior to the Plan Effective Date. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 3990 Rogerdale Road, Houston, Texas 77042 and our main telephone number at that address is (713) 325-6000. Our website is available at www.cjenergy.com.

Business Overview
From late 2011 through mid-2016, we executed an aggressive growth strategy that diversified the Company’s service offerings and geographic reach (including in such locations as the Middle East, the Americas, and Europe). With the change in our executive team and subsequent Chapter 11 Proceeding in 2016, we refocused our strategy and plans. Beginning in 2016 and into 2018, we divested our non-core businesses, including specialty chemicals, equipment manufacturing, directional drilling and artificial lift. Additionally, we shut down our emergent Middle East operations in 2016 (completing the liquidation in 2018), and sold our Canadian rig business in November 2017, in furtherance of our goal of becoming the leading oilfield services provider across our service offering in onshore basins in the continental United States. 
In November 2017, we acquired O-Tex Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation ("O-Tex"), for approximately $271.9 million, making us one of the largest oilfield cementers in the continental United States. In connection with this transaction, we also acquired the remaining 49.0% non-controlling interest in a partially owned O-Tex subsidiary for $1.25 million, which strengthened the data controls instrument business of our research and technology efforts (collectively, the "O-Tex Transaction"). O-Tex specialized in both primary and secondary downhole specialty cementing services in most major U.S. shale plays. The O-Tex Transaction strengthened our position as a leading oilfield services provider with a best-in-class well construction, intervention and completions platform.
In 2018, we focused on the continuous improvement of our organization, including advancing several ongoing initiatives purposed to strengthen our organization, optimize our business processes, ensure the quality of our operations, and gain greater efficiency over time. We also took a deliberate approach to increasing our core capabilities, adding capacity, growing our core service lines, and fully integrating the O-Tex asset base. 
Our Reportable Segments and Strategy
During the first quarter of 2018, we revised our reportable segments. This revision eliminated the Other Services segment, which consisted of those smaller, non-core business lines that have since been divested, including our specialty chemical business, equipment manufacturing and repair business, and coiled tubing operations in the Middle East.  In line with the discontinuance of these business lines, subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2016, financial information for the Other Services reportable segment is only presented for the corresponding prior year period. As a result of the revised reportable segment structure, we have restated the corresponding items of the segment information for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2018, our reportable segments were:

• | Completion Services, which consists of the following business lines: (1) fracturing services; (2) cased-hole wireline and pumping services; and (3) completion support services, which includes our research and technology (“R&T”) department.


• | Well Construction and Intervention Services ("WC&I"), which consists of the following business lines: (1) cementing services and (2) coiled tubing services.


• | Well Support Services, which consists of the following business lines: (1) rig services; (2) fluids management services; and (3) specialty well site services.

During the first quarter of 2018, we decided to exit our directional drilling business and artificial lift business. We are in the process of divesting the assets and inventory associated with our directional drilling operations. We completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and inventory associated with the artificial lift business on July 2, 2018. 
Each reportable segment is described in more detail below. Our results of operations in our core service lines are driven primarily by five interrelated, fluctuating variables: (1) the drilling, completion and production activities of our customers, which is primarily driven by oil and natural gas prices and directly affects the demand for our services; (2) the price we are able to charge for our services and equipment, which is primarily driven by the level of demand for our services and the supply of equipment capacity in the market; (3) the cost of materials, supplies and labor involved in providing our services, and our ability to pass those costs on to our customers; and (4) our activity, or “utilization” levels; and (5) the quality, safety and efficiency of our service execution. 
Our management team monitors asset utilization, among other factors, for purposes of assessing our overall activity levels and customer demand. For our Completion Services segment, we measure our asset utilization levels primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month, which 
4

excludes scheduled maintenance days. We generally consider an asset to be working such days that it is at or in transit to a job location, regardless of the number of hours worked or whether it generated any revenue during such time. In our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment, we measure our asset utilization levels for our cementing business primarily by the total number of days that our asset base works on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. In our coiled tubing business, we measure certain asset utilization levels by the hour to better understand measures between daylight and 24-hour operations. Both the financial and operating performance of our coiled tubing and cement units can vary in revenue and profitability from job to job depending on the type of service to be performed and the equipment, personnel and consumables required for the job, as well as competitive factors and market conditions in the region in which the services are performed. In our Well Support Services segment, we measure asset utilization levels primarily by the number of hours our assets work on a monthly basis, based on the available working days per month. 
Our operating strategy is focused on maintaining high asset utilization levels to maximize revenue generation while controlling costs to gain a competitive advantage and drive returns. We believe that the safety, quality and efficiency of our service execution and our alignment with customers who recognize the value that we provide are central to our efforts to support utilization and grow our business. Given the volatile and cyclical nature of activity drivers in the U.S. onshore oilfield services industry, coupled with the varying prices we are able to charge for our services and the cost of providing those services, among other factors, operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle. For additional information about factors impacting our business and results of operations, please see “Industry Trends and Outlook” in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report. 
Completion Services
The core services provided through our Completion Services segment are fracturing and cased-hole wireline and pumping services. We utilize our in-house manufacturing capabilities, including our R&T department and data control instruments business, to offer a technologically advanced and efficiency focused range of completion techniques. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our fracturing business.
Fracturing. Our fleet is capable of handling the most technically demanding well completions in conventional and unconventional high-pressure formations. We leverage our R&T capabilities to provide customers with engineered frac designs, refracturing and other reservoir stimulation services that help regain production and increase well recovery. We also can provide our services using smaller frac fleets in response to customer demand for vertical fracs and restimulation services.
Cased-hole Wireline and Pumping. Through our cased-hole wireline and pumping services business, we are one of the leading providers of perforating, pumpdown, pipe recovery, pressure pumping, and wellsite make-up and pressure testing services. We are highly experienced in safely servicing deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells in some of the most active onshore basins in the United States and provide premium perforating services for both wireline and tubing-conveyed applications. Our in-house manufacturing capabilities through our R&T department allow us to manage costs and lead times with regard to hardware and perforating guns, switches and accessories, providing us with a competitive advantage and enabling higher returns. 
Well Construction and Intervention Services
Cementing. Following the closing of the O-Tex Transaction, we are one of the largest providers of specialty cementing services in the United States. Our operations are supported by multiple full-service laboratory facilities with advanced capabilities.
Coiled Tubing. We offer a complete range of coiled tubing services to help customers accomplish a wide variety of goals in their horizontal completion, workover and well maintenance projects. The majority of our coiled tubing fleet consists of large diameter coil, meaning two inches or larger in diameter, which allows us to service wells with longer lateral lengths. Our coiled tubing services allow customers to complete projects quickly and safely across a wide spectrum of pressures, without having to shut in their wells.
Well Support Services
Our Well Support Services segment focuses on post-completion activities at the well site, and includes rig services, such as workover, fluids management, and other specialty well site services. Although we previously provided artificial lift applications through this segment, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and inventory associated with this 
5

business on July 2, 2018. The majority of revenue for this segment is generated by our rig services business, and we consider our rig services and fluids management businesses to be our core service lines within this reportable segment.
Rig Services. As part of our services that help prolong the productive life of an oil or gas well, we operate one of the largest fleets in the United States. These rigs are involved in the routine repair and maintenance of oil and gas wells, re-drilling operations and plug and abandonment operations. Workover services can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling horizontal or lateral wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously bypassed production zones, converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced recovery operations and conducting major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures. Workover services may last from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the workover. Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet are generally required throughout the life cycle of an oil or gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical repairs to the pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from wellbores, and pulling rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify and resolve production problems. Maintenance services are generally less complicated than completion and workover related services and require less time to perform. Our rig fleet is also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or gas wells that are at the end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally require auxiliary equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment services is not significantly impacted by the demand for oil and gas because well operators are required by state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.
Fluids Management. We provide a full range of fluid services, including the storage, transportation and disposal of various fluids used in the drilling, completion and workover of oil and gas wells. Our fleet of trucks and trailers and portable tanks enable us to rapidly deploy our equipment across a broad geographic area. Included in our fleet of fluid trucks and trailers are specialized trucks and trailers that are optimized to transport condensate. We also own private salt water disposal wells. Demand and pricing for our fluids management services generally correspond to demand for our rig services.
Other Information About Our Business
Seasonality
Our operations are subject to seasonal factors and our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations that impact activity in our core business lines. Specifically, we typically have experienced a pause by our customers around the holiday season in the fourth quarter, which may be compounded as our customers exhaust their annual capital spending budgets towards year end. Additionally, our operations are directly affected by weather conditions. During the winter months our customers may delay operations or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations during periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, and during the spring some areas impose transportation restrictions due to the muddy conditions caused by the spring thaws. During the summer months, our operations may be impacted by tropical weather systems.
Sales and Marketing
Sales of our core business lines are primarily generated by the efforts of our sales force, working closely with our operations teams. 
Sales and marketing activities are typically performed through our local operations in each geographic region, as well as through our corporate sales teams in Houston.  For our other core business lines, we believe our local field sales personnel have a strong understanding of region-specific issues and customer operating procedures and, therefore, can effectively target marketing activities. We also have multiple corporate sales representatives that supplement our field sales efforts and focus on large accounts and selling technical services. Our sales representatives collaborate with our legal team to identify customer contracting needs in advance of potential operations, which we believe helps streamline our customer onboarding process. Our sales representatives work closely with our local managers and field sales personnel to target compelling market opportunities. Our ability to deliver integrated services through the life of the well and strong track record provides cross-selling and bundling opportunities with existing customers. We facilitate teamwork among our sales representatives by basing a portion of their compensation on aggregate company sales targets rather than individual sales targets. We believe this emphasis on teamwork enables us to better serve our existing customers and may also allow us to further expand our customer base, including through cross-selling and bundling opportunities.
We offer relatively short-term services that generally are cancelable at any time, and as such have no backlogs.

Customers
We serve a diverse group of independent and major national oil and gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations across the continental United States. We seek customers who value our technology, safety priorities and efficiency capabilities. We monitor the financial condition of our customers, their capital expenditure plans and other indications of their drilling, completion and production services activity. In particular, we seek to identify distressed customers and apply what we believe to be appropriate business and legal measures to protect us from any defaults or failures to pay.
Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44.2%, 40.7% and 46.0% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. There were no individual customers that accounted for more than 10.0% of our consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. If we were to lose any material customer or group of customers that were material in the aggregate, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels and such loss could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.
Competition 
We operate in highly competitive areas of the oilfield services industry with significant potential for excess capacity. Equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of assets relative to activity in any particular area. Utilization and pricing for our services have from time to time been negatively affected by increases in supply relative to demand in our operating areas and geographic markets. 
The demand for our services depends primarily on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for drilling, completion and production activities, which is affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices and numerous other factors over which we have no control. Severe declines and sustained weakness and volatility in commodity prices may negatively impact the level of drilling, completion and production activity and capital expenditures by our customers, adversely affected the demand for our services. This, in turn, may negatively impact our ability to maintain adequate utilization of our asset base and to negotiate pricing at levels generating sufficient margins. 
Our revenues and earnings are directly affected by changes in the utilization of our assets and pricing for our services, which fluctuate in direct response to changes in the level of drilling, completion and production activity by our customers. Pressure on pricing for our services, including due to competition and industry and/or economic conditions, may impact, among other things, our ability to maintain utilization and profitability. During periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our results. Furthermore, even when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset any rising costs. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our utilization levels. The inability to maintain our utilization and pricing levels, or to increase our prices as our costs increase, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Our competitors include many large and small energy service companies, including some of the largest integrated oilfield services companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our larger competitors may be able to compete more effectively than we can, including by reducing prices to levels that we cannot sustain for our services. Our major competitors for both our Completion Services and Well Construction and Intervention Services segments include Halliburton, Schlumberger, BJ Services, Keane Group, RPC, Inc., FTS International, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp., Basic Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, CalFrac Well Services, as well as a significant number of regional, predominantly private businesses. Our major competitors for our Well Support Services include Key Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Precision Drilling, Forbes Energy Services, Pioneer Energy Services and Ranger Energy Services, as well as a significant number of predominantly private, regional businesses.
Generally, we believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets that we serve are price, technical expertise, equipment capacity and quality, work force capability, safety record, reputation and experience. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded work, particularly during times of weak or volatile commodity prices. Additionally, projects for certain of our core services are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to further increase competition based primarily on price. During a downturn, our utilization and pricing levels may also be negatively impacted by predatory pricing from certain large competitors, who elect to operate at negative margins in attempt to gain or retain market share. 
7

During healthier market conditions, we believe many of our customers choose to work with us based on our life-of-well capabilities, geographic footprint and scale, reputation for safety, the quality of our crews, equipment and services, and our value-added technology, although we must always be competitive in our pricing. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our major competitors by our operating philosophy, which is focused on delivering the highest quality customer service and equipment, safely and with superior execution and operating efficiency. As part of this strategy, we seek customers who are aligned with our strengths and want dedicated services, and we target high volume, high efficiency customers with service intensive, 24-hour work, which is where we believe we can differentiate our services from our competitors.
See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Industry Trends and Outlook” for additional discussion of the market challenges within our industry.
Research & Technology, Intellectual Property
Over the last several years we have significantly invested in technological advancement, including the development of a state-of-the-art research and technology center staffed by a team of highly skilled engineers. Our efforts to date have been focused on developing innovative, fit-for-purpose solutions designed to enhance our service offerings, increase efficiencies, provide cost savings to our operations and add value for our customers. Our R&T initiatives generate monthly cost savings for our integrated completion services operations, which is central to our overall strategy of proactively managing our costs to maximize returns. Several of these investments provide value added products and services that, in addition to producing revenue, are creating increasing demand from key customers. In our day-to-day operations, we utilize equipment and products manufactured by our vertically integrated businesses which are managed through our R&T department, and we also sell such equipment and products to third-party customers in the global energy services industry. We believe that our focus on R&T provides a significant strategic benefit through the ability to develop and implement new technologies and quickly respond to changes in customer requirements and industry demand.
We seek patent and trademark protection for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents and trademarks are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. We also rely, to a significant extent, on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position.
See Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional detail as to our investment in technological advancement. 
Suppliers
We purchase raw materials (such as proppant, guar, acid, chemicals, completion fluids, cement and coiled tubing strings) and finished products (such as fluid ends, valves, power ends and pump consumables) used in our Completion Services segment and our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment and certain raw materials and finished products used in our Well Support Services segment from various third-party suppliers. 
We are not materially dependent on any single supply source for the materials or products that are critical to our operations, and we believe that we would be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply or recall of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers. However, if alternative sources of supply are unavailable and we are unable to purchase the necessary materials and/or products needed for our business in a timely manner and in the quantities required, we may be delayed in providing our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in the past, our industry has faced sporadic guar and proppant shortages and trucking shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several of our competitors. Additionally, increasing costs of certain raw materials, such as guar, may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, one supplier from our Well Completions Services segment, Covia Corporation, supplied 7.2%, of our total Company's materials and/or products; but no single third-party supplier from our Well Construction and Intervention Services segment and Well Support Services segment supplied 5.0% or more of the Company's materials and/or products. In conjunction with the sale of our manufacturing business line, we also entered into a preferred supply agreement with a third-party to supply us with components and finished goods to repair and refurbish certain of our hydraulic fracturing equipment.

Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental (“QHSE”) Program
Our business involves the operation of extremely heavy and powerful equipment and the use of explosive and radioactive materials, among other hazards. If not well managed, these operations have the potential to result in serious injuries to our employees and/or third-parties and substantial damage to property or the environment. We commit significant resources towards employee safety and have a robust new hire program. We also have comprehensive QHSE-focused training programs designed to minimize accidents in the workplace and improve the safety, quality and efficiency of our operations. We believe that our QHSE policies, standards and procedures, which are reviewed internally for compliance with industry changes, provide a reliable framework to ensure our operations minimize the hazards inherent in our work and meet regulatory requirements and customer demands. Further, we are in the process of implementing a quality management system that will create standardization of processes throughout all facets of our business, support our risk mitigation strategy and help ensure compliance with our procedures and processes. 
Our record and reputation for safety are important to all aspects of our business. In the oilfield services industry, a critical competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger customers have placed an added emphasis on the safety records and quality management systems of their contractors. We strive to meet or exceed the safety and quality management requirements of our customers, and we believe our continued focus on safety will gain even further importance to our customers as the market continues to improve. Our reputation and proven safety record have allowed us to earn work certifications from several industry leaders that we believe have some of the most demanding safety requirements, including ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell.
Risk Management and Insurance
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, including blowouts, explosions, cratering, fires, oil spills, surface and underground pollution and contamination, hazardous material spills, loss of well control, damage to or loss of the wellbore, formation or underground reservoir, damage or loss from the use of explosives and radioactive materials, and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, loss of oil and natural gas production, suspension of operations or loss of license to conduct business, damage to or destruction of the environment and natural resources and damage to or destruction of the property of others. Additionally, our business involves, and so is subject to hazards associated with, the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, as well as heavily regulated explosive and radioactive materials. Regularly having a significant number of both commercial and non-commercial motor vehicles on the road creates a high risk of vehicle accidents that may result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and the property of others and hazardous material spills. The occurrence of a serious accident involving our employees, equipment and/or services, could result in C&J being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims for damages. C&J could also be liable to indemnify certain third-parties, specifically including its customers, for large claims for damages in situations where our employees, equipment and/or services were involved. 
Despite our efforts to maintain high safety and security standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents, outages, breaches, and other incidents, and it is likely that we will experience the same in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these events, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, as well as our relationship with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensatory payments, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our business relies heavily on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure, the failure of which may cause disruptions to our operations. Any such failure, whether resulting from outages, employee error, cyber-attacks, or other similar events, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
We carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations including coverage for workers’ compensation and employers liability, automobile liability, general liability, which also includes sudden and accidental pollution insurance, environmental liability, and property damage relating to catastrophic events, together with excess loss liability coverage. These insurance policies carry self-insured retention limits or deductibles on a per occurrence basis at levels we believe to be customary and reasonable. We have deductibles per occurrence for: workers’ compensation and employers liability claims of $1,000,000; automobile liability claims of $1,000,000; general liability claims, including sudden and accidental pollution claims, of $250,000, plus an additional annual aggregate deductible of $250,000; environmental liability claims of $500,000; and property damage for catastrophic events of $50,000. The excess loss liability coverage is subject to a self-insured retention of $5,000,000 for each occurrence and in the aggregate. We also carry coverage applicable to a number of cyber liabilities, 
9

including cyber extortion, security failures, and network interruptions. These cyber liability coverages are subject to a self-insured retention of $100,000 for each occurrence.
With respect to the C&P Business that we acquired from Nabors in the Nabors Merger, and as a result of the settlement agreement negotiated with Nabors in connection the Chapter 11 Proceeding, we assumed, among other liabilities, all liabilities of the C&P Business to the extent arising out of or resulting from the operation of the C&P Business at any time before, at or after the closing of the Nabors Merger, including liability for death, personal injury and property damage resulting from or caused by the assets, products and services of the C&P Business, other than those liabilities specifically identified in the settlement agreement, as incorporated into the Restructuring Plan, for which Nabors maintains a continuing indemnification obligation. Please see “U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Investigation into Pre-Nabors Merger Incident” in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information about the certain legal proceedings related to the C&P Business.
As discussed below, our Master Service Agreements (“MSAs”) with our customers generally provide, among other things, that our customers generally assume (without regard to fault) liability for underground pollution and pollution emanating from the wellbore as a result of an explosion, fire or blowout. We retain the risk for any liabilities which we cause, and which are not otherwise indemnified by our customers. This includes liability to indemnify our customer for certain liabilities. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable or on terms as favorable as our current arrangements.
We strive to enter into MSAs with each of our customers before providing any services. Our sales and operations teams work closely with our legal team to identify and prioritize MSAs for negotiation, which we believe increases the efficiency of our risk management efforts. These MSAs delineate our and our customers’ respective warranty and indemnification obligations with respect to the services we provide. With respect to warranty issues, our MSAs typically provide that our obligations are limited to replacing any defective good or services, or in the alternative, providing the customer with a refund. Our MSAs typically provide for knock-for-knock indemnification for all bodily injuries and property losses arising from our work, which means that we and our customers assume (without regard to fault) liability for damages to our respective personnel and property. For catastrophic losses, our MSAs generally include industry-standard carve-outs from the knock-for-knock indemnities, pursuant to which our customers (typically the exploration and production companies) assume (without regard to fault) liability for (i) damage to the well bore, including the cost to re-drill; (ii) damage to the formation, underground strata and the reservoir; (iii) damages or claims arising from loss of control of a well or a blowout; and (iv) allegations of subsurface trespass. Additionally, our MSAs often provide carve-outs to the “without regard to fault” concept that would permit, for example, us to be held responsible for events of catastrophic loss to the extent they arise as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our MSAs typically provide for industry-standard pollution indemnities, pursuant to which we assume liability for surface pollution associated with our equipment and originating above the surface (without regard to fault), and our customer assumes (without regard to fault) liability arising from all other pollution, including, without limitation, underground pollution and pollution emanating from the wellbore as a result of an explosion, fire or blowout. In certain circumstances, we agree to exceptions from our MSAs’ catastrophic loss and pollution indemnities to the extent incidents arise from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The description of insurance policies set forth above is a summary of certain material terms of our insurance policies currently in effect and may change in the future as a result of market and/or other conditions. Similarly, the summary of MSAs set forth above is a summary of the material terms of the typical MSA that we have in place, but does not reflect every MSA that is in effect or that we may enter into in the future, some of which may contain indemnity structures and risk allocations between our customers and us that are different and less favorable than those described here. 
Employees
As of February 22, 2019, we have 6,399 employees. The delivery of our core completion services requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. Due to the commodity price volatility often experienced in the energy services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers often choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a less strenuous work environment. During periods of high demand for oil field services, there can be extreme competition amongst employers to attract and retain skilled workers, which often results in a shortage of qualified employees and attrition due to wage escalation by competitors. Additionally, in our Well Support Services segment we continue to experience labor shortages for qualified drivers with a commercial driver's license and workover rig operators for our rig services business.
Our employees are not represented by any labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be generally good.

Government Regulations and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
We are significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing worker health and safety, motor carrier operations, the transportation of explosives, the use, management and disposal of certain radioactive materials, the handling of hazardous materials and the emission or discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Regulations concerning equipment certification create an ongoing need for regular maintenance, which is incorporated into our daily operating procedures. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects profitability. Any failure by us to comply with such local, state and federal laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the following:

• | issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;


• | modification, denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations;


• | imposition of limitations on our operations through injunctions or other governmental actions; and


• | performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.

Worker Health and Safety
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSHA has implemented stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, which would apply to use of sand as a proppant for hydraulic fracturing. These new standards require the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls and work practices to limit exposures below the new limits by June 23, 2021. 
Motor Carrier Operations
Among the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations; regulatory safety; hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking; financial reporting; and certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period and requiring onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size. For example, in December 2016, the DOT finalized minimum training standards for new drivers seeking a commercial driver’s license. Certain motor vehicle operators are required to register with the DOT. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The DOT periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria, and a revocation could result in a suspension of operations. Since 2010, the DOT has pursued its Compliance, Safety, Accountability (“CSA”) program, in an effort to improve commercial truck and bus safety. A component of CSA is the Safety Measurement System (“SMS”), which analyzes all safety violations recorded by federal and state law enforcement personnel to determine a carrier’s safety performance. The SMS is intended to allow DOT to identify carriers with safety issues and intervene to address those problems. 
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. DOT regulations also mandate drug testing of drivers. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
11

Radioactive Materials
In addition, some of our operations utilize equipment that contains sealed, low-grade radioactive sources. Our activities involving the use of radioactive materials are regulated by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) and state regulatory agencies under agreement with the NRC. Standards implemented by these regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of such radioactive materials. We believe that we have obtained these licenses and approvals as necessary and applicable. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution. In addition, releases of radioactive material could result in substantial remediation costs and potentially expose us to third-party property damage or personal injury claims.
Hazardous Substances 
We generate wastes, including hazardous wastes, which are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the NRC, and state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste.” Disposal of such non-hazardous oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is usually regulated by state law. Other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within this exclusion. Moreover, stricter standards for waste handling and disposal may be imposed on the oil and natural gas industry in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes new rulemaking, the 2016 consent decree requires the EPA to take final action on such rules no later than July 15, 2021. Removal of RCRA’s exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase waste disposal costs, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The impact of future revisions to environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted. 
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry. The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws. Standards have been developed for: worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws. It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.
The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law), and comparable state statutes impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to have been responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties and facilities that for many years have been used for industrial activities, including oil and natural gas related operations. Hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third-parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons, was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes and remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination), including instances where the prior owner or operator caused the contamination, or perform remedial plugging of disposal wells or waste pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.

Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the EPA or applicable state agencies. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. In September 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) issued a new rule defining the scope of the EPA’s and the Corps’ jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters. On December 11, 2018, EPA and the Corps issued a proposed new rule that would differently revise the definition of waters of the United States and essentially replace the 2015 rule. According to the agencies, the proposed new rule is intended to increase CWA program predictability and consistency by increasing clarity as to the scope of ‘waters of the United States’ federally regulated under the Act. If finalized, this new definition of waters of the United States will likely be challenged and sought to be enjoined in federal court. Until that time, regulations are being implemented as they were prior to August 2015. A public hearing on this proposed rule was scheduled for January 23, 2019, but this hearing was postponed due to the shutdown of the federal government in early 2019. The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure regulations under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak.
In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Moreover, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from such spills in waters of the United States. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the OPA, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.
The Safe Water Drinking Act (“SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program. Hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program. In addition, in response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and gas-related wastewater, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have imposed volumetric injection limits, shut down or imposed moratorium on the use of such injection wells. If new regulatory initiatives are implemented that restrict or prohibit the use of underground injection wells in areas where we rely upon the use of such wells in our operations, our costs to operate may significantly increase and our ability to perform services may be delayed or limited, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
Air Emissions
Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws require permits for certain facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality. These laws and their implementing regulations also impose generally applicable limitations on air emissions and require adherence to maintenance, work practice, reporting and record keeping, and other requirements. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit or other regulatory requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties. In addition, we or our customers could be required to shut down or retrofit existing equipment, leading to additional expenses and operational delays.
Many of these regulatory requirements, including New Source Performance Standards and Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards have been made more stringent over time as a result of stricter ambient air quality standards and other air quality protection goals adopted by the EPA. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards. Subsequently, in November 2017, the EPA published a list of areas that are in compliance with the new ozone standards and separately in December 2017 issued responses to state recommendation for designating nonattainment areas. Remaining area designations were completed on July 17, 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. 
13

Compliance with these and other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase costs for us and our customers. Although we do not believe our operations will be materially adversely affected by these requirements, our business could be materially affected if our customers’ operations are significantly affected by these or other similar requirements. These requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers, reduce the demand for the oil and gas our customers produce, and thus have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services.
Climate Change
More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur additional operating costs or reduce the demand for our services. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA and many scientists, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, EPA has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, including rules that require preconstruction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources. In subsequent litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a portion of the EPA’s GHG stationary source program, but also invalidated a portion of it, holding that stationary sources already subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ("PSD") or Title V program for non-GHG criteria pollutants remained subject to GHG requirements, but that sources subject to the PSD or Title V program only for GHGs could not be forced to comply with EPA’s GHG requirements. Upon remand, the D.C. Circuit issued an amended judgment, which, among other things, vacated the GHG regulations under review in that case to the extent they require a stationary source to obtain a PSD or Title V permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit GHGs above the applicable major source thresholds. In October 2016, the EPA issued a proposed rule to further revise its PSD and Title V regulations applicable to GHGs in accordance with these court rulings. This rulemaking process is ongoing. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified GHG sources, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing transmission and storage activities. The EPA’s final rule package includes first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. However, over the past year the EPA has taken several steps to delay implementation of these methane rules, and the agency proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to stay the requirements for a period of two years and revisit implementation of the EPA’s methane rules in their entirety. EPA proposed revisions on September 11, 2018, intended to roll back parts of the 2016 rules. The EPA has not yet published a final rule but, as a result of these developments, future implementation of the EPA methane rules is uncertain at this time. In April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in federal district court aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending. In addition, the EPA finalized rules to further reduce GHG emissions, primarily from coal-fired power plants, under its Clean Power Plan. However, on October 9, 2017, the EPA announced that it will repeal the Clean Power Plan and, on August 21, 2018, proposed the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule, which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the Clean Power Plan and the rulemaking process is ongoing. The Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) also finalized similar rules in November 2016 which seek to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands through limitations on the venting and flaring of gas, as well as enhanced leak detection and repair requirements for certain equipment and processes. In September 2018, the BLM issued a rule that relaxes or rescinds certain requirements of these regulations; California and New Mexico have challenged the new rule in ongoing litigation. We do not believe our operations are currently subject to these requirements, but, to the extent fully implemented, our business could be affected if our customers’ operations become subject to these or other similar requirements. Moreover, these requirements could increase the cost of doing business for us and our customers, reduce the demand for the oil and gas our customers produce, and thus have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services.
In addition, while Congress has yet to pass legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have established or joined GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. In addition, in 2015, the U.S. participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement has a four year exit process. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are 
14

unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any new federal, regional or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other GHGs that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions on our customers. Such restrictions could potentially make our customers’ products more expensive and thus reduce demand for such products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services and our business. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth’s atmosphere may produce climatic changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We commonly perform hydraulic fracturing services for our customers. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but, as noted above, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 that applies to such activities. In addition, the EPA has taken certain actions noted above and issued final regulations under the CAA governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; and finalized rules in June 2016 to prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, compliance with which is required by August 2019. Also, the BLM finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Native American lands. The BLM issued a final rule in December 2017 repealing its hydraulic fracturing rule, and this action has been challenged in federal court. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
In addition, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, well construction and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas. For example, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In light of concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced waters into underground wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. A 2015 U.S. Geological Survey report identified eight states with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction. Any regulation that restricts the ability to dispose of produced waters or increases the cost of doing business could cause curtailed or decreased demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform hydraulic fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could result in decreased oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our services and our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business. The Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or its habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must also 
15

designate the species’ critical habitat and suitable habitat as part of the effort to ensure survival of the species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. If our customers were to have areas within their business and operations designated as critical or suitable habitat or a protected species, it could decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business.
There have been no material incidents or citations related to our hydraulic fracturing operations in the past five years. During that period, we have not been involved in any litigation over alleged environmental violations, have not been ordered to pay any material monetary fine or penalty with respect to alleged environmental violations, and are not currently facing any type of governmental enforcement action or other regulatory proceeding involving alleged environmental violations related to our hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, pursuant to our MSAs, we are generally liable for only surface pollution, not underground or flowback pollution, which our customers are generally liable for and for which we are typically indemnified by our customers.
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with underground contamination that may occur as a result of well services activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site and may not continue to be available or may not be available at premium levels that justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Overall, we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is possible, however, that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify.
