     Item 1 – Business
     Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments
     Chase Corporation (the “Company,” “Chase,” “we,” or “us”), a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications across diverse market sectors. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Through investments in facilities, systems and organizational consolidation we seek to improve performance and gain economies of scale. 
 In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we reorganized from two into three reportable operating segments, an Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, an Industrial Tapes segment and a Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment (whose operations were formerly included within the Industrial Materials segment) offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are used in, or integrated into, another company’s products.  Demand for the segment’s product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company, and serves diverse markets and applications.  The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliances, medical, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The Industrial Tapes segment (whose operations were formerly included within the Industrial Materials segment) features legacy wire and cable materials, specialty tapes, and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers’ products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Industrial Tapes segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment (formerly known as the Construction Materials segment) is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as “Chase” branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segment’s products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets. With sales generally dependent on outdoor project work, the segment experiences highly seasonal sales patterns. Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments apart from our O’Hara Township, PA, Blawnox, PA and Hickory, NC facilities, which produce products related to a combination of operating segments.

      Other Business Developments
 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. Currently, the pulling and detection operations are the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this lease). The process of moving continued subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $526,000 in expense related to the move in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are currently anticipated to be approximately $700,000, and the Company plans to disclose these amounts within operations optimization costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in future periods.

 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company’s facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase is currently reviewing the data and recommendations provided by the study and may further utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar work, as well as work on optimizing our computer systems. The Company recognized $200,000 in expense related to these services in fiscal 2019. 
 On June 25, 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. This is in line with the Company’s ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period. The Company expensed $1,272,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the closure, including: (a) cash-related employee-related, logistics and uncapitalized facilities improvement costs of $590,000; and (b) non-cash-related accelerated depreciation expense of $682,000. The Company also recognized $260,000 in expenses related to this move in the three-month period ended November 30, 2018, with no additional expense recognized in the final nine months of fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 On April 20, 2018, Chase finalized an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, operational machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company’s structural composites rod business, as well as a license related to the production and sale of rod, for proceeds of $2,232,000, net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. This business, which was part of the structural composites product line within the Industrial Tapes segment, had limited growth and profitability prospects as part of the Company, and was outside the areas Chase has identified for strategic emphasis. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $1,480,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a gain on sale of businesses within the consolidated statement of operations. Chase received $2,075,000, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with the remaining $157,000 received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of a working capital true-up. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.  The purchaser also entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser.    On December 29, 2017, Chase entered an agreement to acquire Stewart Superabsorbents, LLC (“SSA, LLC”), an advanced superabsorbent polymer (SAP) formulator and solutions provider, with operations located in Hickory and McLeansville, NC. The transaction closed on December 31, 2017. In its final fiscal year before its acquisition, SSA, LLC, and its recently-acquired Zappa-Tec business (collectively “Zappa Stewart”) had combined revenue in excess of $24,000,000. This acquisition proved to be immediately accretive to the Company’s earnings in the period of acquisition, after adjusting for nonrecurring costs associated with the transaction and financing. The business was acquired for a purchase price of $73,469,000 after final working capital adjustments and excluding acquisition-related costs.  As part of this transaction, Chase acquired all assets of the business, and entered multiyear leases at both locations. The Company expensed $393,000 of acquisition-related costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2018.  The purchase was funded from a combination of Chase’s existing revolving credit facility and available cash on hand. Zappa Stewart’s protective materials technology complements Chase’s current specialty chemicals offerings. This acquisition is aligned with the Company’s core strategies and extends its reach into growing medical, environmental and consumer applications. The Company finalized purchase accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, without any adjustment to amounts recorded at August 31, 2018. Following the effective date of the acquisition the financial results of Zappa Stewart’s operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements in the specialty chemical intermediates product line, contained within the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment. 
 On April 3, 2017, Chase executed an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company’s fiber optic cable components product line for proceeds of $3,858,000 net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $2,013,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as gain on sale of businesses within the consolidated statement of operations.  Further, the purchaser entered a multiyear lease for a portion of the manufacturing space at the Company’s Granite Falls, NC facility. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services. The

Company’s fiber optic cable components product line’s historical results are included as part of the Company’s Industrial Tapes operating segment.
 On September 30, 2016, the Company acquired certain assets of Resin Designs, LLC (“Resin Designs”), an advanced adhesives and sealants manufacturer, with locations in Woburn, MA and Newark, CA. The business was acquired for a purchase price of $30,270,000 after final working capital adjustments and excluding acquisition-related costs. As part of this transaction, Chase acquired all working capital and fixed assets of the business, and entered multiyear leases at both locations. The Company expensed $584,000 of acquisition-related costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 associated with this acquisition. The purchase was funded entirely with available cash on hand. Resin Designs is a formulator of customized adhesive and sealant systems used in high-reliability electronic applications. The acquisition broadens the Company’s adhesives and sealants product offering and manufacturing capabilities, and expands its market reach. Since the effective date of the acquisition, the financial results of Resin Designs’ operations have been included in the Company’s financial statements within the electronic and industrial coatings product line, contained within the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment.

      There is some seasonality in selling products into the construction market, which most acutely effects our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Higher demand is often experienced when temperatures are warmer in most of North America (April through October), with lower demand occurring when temperatures are colder (typically our second fiscal quarter).  
     Employees
     As of October 31, 2019, we employed approximately 726 people (including union employees).  We consider our employee relations to be good.  In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements.     Backlog, Customers and Competition
     As of October 31, 2019, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $17,930,000.  This compared with a backlog of $21,825,000 as of October 31, 2018.  The decrease in backlog from the prior year amount is primarily due to the changes in the ordering patterns of our customers year-over-year. During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales.  No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government.
     There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us.  Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have.  We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price.  
     Raw Materials
     We obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times.

 Item 1A – Risk Factors        The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We feel that any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or our future financial performance. While we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.
     We currently operate in mature markets where increases or decreases in market share could be significant.        Our sales and net income are largely dependent on sales from a consistent and well-established customer base.  Organic growth opportunities are minimal; however, we have used and will continue to use strategic acquisitions as a means to build and grow the business.   In this business environment, increases or decreases in market share could have a material effect on our business condition or results of operation.  We face intense competition from a diverse range of competitors, including operating divisions of companies much larger and with far greater resources than we have.  If we are unable to maintain our market share, our business could suffer.
     Our business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions, which may not be successful if they happen at all.        From time to time, we engage in discussions with potential target companies concerning potential acquisitions.  In executing our acquisition strategy, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates.  In addition, we may face competition from other companies for acquisition candidates, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms.  We have historically financed larger acquisitions with additional borrowings under our bank credit agreements. Our existing credit agreement places certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, and imposes certain financial covenants on us that may limit our ability to borrow generally. If we incur additional indebtedness in order to finance an acquisition, that indebtedness may reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions, and may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates. If we finance an acquisition through the issuance of equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders would be proportionately diluted.
     Even if we do identify a suitable acquisition target and are able to negotiate and close a transaction, the integration of an acquired business into our operations involves numerous risks, including potential difficulties in integrating an acquired company’s product line with ours; the diversion of our resources and management’s attention from other business concerns; the potential loss of key employees; limitations imposed by antitrust or merger control laws in the United States or other jurisdictions; risks associated with entering a new geographical or product market; and the day-to-day management of a larger and more diverse combined company.  
     We may not realize the synergies, operating efficiencies, market position or revenue growth we anticipate from acquisitions, and our failure to effectively manage the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and financial performance.

 Our results of operations could be adversely affected by uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses and levels of business activity.        Global economic and political conditions can affect the businesses of our customers and the markets they serve. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect, among others, the automotive, housing, construction, pipeline, energy, transportation infrastructure or electronics industries. This may reduce demand for our products or depress pricing of those products, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions or foreign and domestic trade policy could also shift demand to products for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected.  
     General economic factors, domestically and internationally, may also adversely affect our financial performance through increased raw material costs or other expenses and by making access to capital more difficult. 
     The cumulative effect of higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors (including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes to federal, state, local and international tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws) could adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our manufacturing costs and other expenses at the same time that our customers may be scaling back demand for our products.  Prices of certain commodity products, including oil and petroleum-based products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, weather events and climate change, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can increase our cost of products and services sold and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. Disruptions in the credit markets may limit our ability to access debt capital for use in acquisitions or other purposes on advantageous terms or at all.  If we are unable to manage our expenses in response to general economic conditions and margin pressures, or if we are unable to obtain capital for strategic acquisitions or other needs, then our results of operations would be negatively affected.
     Fluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results.        We obtain raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Many of these raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market and from a variety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. If the prices of raw materials increase, and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, we could experience reduced profit margins. 
     If our products fail to perform as expected, or if we experience product recalls, we could incur significant and unexpected costs and lose existing and future business.
     Our products are complex and could have defects or errors presently unknown to us, which may give rise to claims against us, diminish our brands or divert our resources from other purposes. Despite testing, new and existing products could contain defects and errors and may in the future contain manufacturing or design defects, errors or performance problems when first introduced, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, changes to our manufacturing processes, product recalls, significant increases in our maintenance costs, or exposure to liability for damages, any of which may result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, require significant management attention, damage our reputation and customer relationships, and adversely affect our business, our operating results and our cash flow.

 We are dependent on key personnel.
     We depend significantly on our executive officers including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, and on other key employees. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our acquisition strategy will require that we attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. The inability to satisfy such requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to remain competitive in the future.  
     If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations. 
 Our strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances. Our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our U.S. operations. In addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. The ongoing negotiations to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union (Brexit), pose risks of volatility in global markets and, given our exposure and presence in the U.K., could specifically affect our operations and future financial results. Risks inherent in our international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, domestic and international tariffs and trade policies and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations (such as those experienced following the June 23, 2016 Brexit referendum vote in the U.K.) may have an impact on future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations. 
 Current and threatened tariffs on goods from China and other countries could result in lower revenue, profits and cash flows.
     The Company (a) imports raw materials from China; (b) makes sales of finished goods into China; and (c) has manufacturing operations in China. The Company works to lower the potential negative effects of the tariffs through seeking alternative sources for our raw materials, when available and pragmatic, and, in certain cases, through altering our manufacturing logistics by utilizing non-U.S. manufacturing where tariffs do not apply. While we also attempt to pass on these additional costs to our customers, competitive factors (including competitors who import from other countries not subject to such tariffs) may limit our ability to sustain price increases and, as a result, may adversely impact our revenue, profits and cash flows. In addition, the imposition of tariffs may influence the sourcing habits of certain end users of our products which, in turn, could have a direct impact on the requirements of our direct customers for our products. Such an impact could adversely affect our revenue, profits and cash flows.
     We may experience difficulties in the redesign and consolidation of our manufacturing facilities which could impact shipments to customers, product quality, and our ability to realize cost savings.
     We currently have several ongoing projects to streamline our manufacturing operations, which include the redesign and consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities in order to reduce overhead costs. Despite our planning, we may be unable to effectively leverage assets, personnel, and business processes in the transition of production among manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty is inherent within the facility redesign and consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits of these streamlining projects, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality.

 Financial market performance may have a material adverse effect on our pension plan assets and require additional funding requirements.
     Significant and sustained declines in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the fair market value of the assets of our pension plans.  While these pension plan assets are considered non-financial assets since they are not carried on our balance sheet (i.e. balance sheet reflects only the net of plan assets and obligations), the fair market valuation of these assets could impact our funding requirements, funded status or net periodic pension cost.  Any significant and sustained declines in the fair market value of these pension assets could require us to increase our funding requirements, which would have an impact on our cash flow, and could also lead to additional pension expense.  
     If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
     We are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include a report by our independent auditors attesting to such effectiveness. Any failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations. 
     As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 (under "Controls and Procedures"), our management concluded that, as of August 31, 2018, we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our business combination processes. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have remediated the identified material weakness, but no assurances can be given that management will not identify in the future internal control deficiencies, with respect to business combination processes or otherwise, that constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting or that any such material weakness will be remediated in a timely fashion.
     If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent auditors determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets.
     Failure or compromise of security with respect to an operating or information system or portable electronic device could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or the effectiveness of our internal controls over operations and financial reporting.
     We are highly dependent on automated systems to record and process our daily transactions and certain other components of our financial statements. We could experience a failure of one or more of these systems, or a compromise of our security due to technical system flaws, data input or record keeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. We may also be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, and electrical/telecommunications outages). All of these risks are also applicable wherever we rely on outside vendors to provide services. Operating system failures, disruptions, or the compromise of security with respect to operating systems or portable electronic devices could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or adversely affect our business, results from operations, financial condition, cash flow or internal control over financial reporting.
