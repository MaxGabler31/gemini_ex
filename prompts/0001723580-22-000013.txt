Item 1. Business.
BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Opes Acquisition Corp. (“OPES”) was formed as a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on July 24, 2017 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or entities (a “Business Combination Transaction”). BurgerFi International, LLC was formed in Delaware on January 27, 2011. On December 16, 2020, to effectuate a Business Combination Transaction, OPES purchased 100% of the membership interests of BurgerFi International, LLC from the members of BurgerFi International, LLC (“Members”), resulting in BurgerFi International, LLC becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of OPES. Subsequently, in connection with this Business Combination Transaction (the "BurgerFi acquisition"), OPES changed its name to “BurgerFi International, Inc.”
On November 3, 2021, BurgerFi International, Inc. acquired 100% of the outstanding shares (the “Anthony's Acquisition”) of Hot Air, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Hot Air") from Cardboard Box LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Cardboard"). Hot Air, through its subsidiaries, owns the business of operating upscale casual dining restaurants in the specialty pizza and wings segment under the name "Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings" ("Anthony's"). 
References to the “Post-Combination Company” refer to BurgerFi International, Inc. after the consummation of the BurgerFi acquisition. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” and other similar references refer to the Post-Combination Company and, unless otherwise stated, all its subsidiaries. The term “BurgerFi” refers to the system-wide fast casual “better burger” concept with 118 franchise and corporate-owned locations in the United States and internationally as of December 31, 2021. The term “Anthony’s” refers to the upscale casual, “well-done” premium pizza and wing concept with 61 corporate-owned locations in the United States as of December 31, 2021.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted economic conditions in the United States, where most of our restaurants are located. The Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, impacts from COVID-19, as federal, state and local governments may continue to react to the public health crisis by encouraging or requiring social distancing, instituting stay-at-home orders, and requiring, in varying degrees, restaurant dine-in limitations, capacity limitations or other restrictions. While the Company has seen a recovery in 2021, including as a result of the changes to consumer behavior to off-premises dining, as well as promotional activities associated with delivery, it is possible that further outbreaks and variants could limit our recovery and negatively impact our business. The Company continues to monitor the spread of new variants. Despite a recent decline in cases, hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask and vaccine mandates, social-distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders could be reinstated in locations where we are located. Although the pandemic has presented challenges, it has also caused us to undertake and accelerate certain growth initiatives, such as new digital capabilities. By positioning ourselves to expand access, safety, and convenience of our customers, we believe that we are positioned to return to growth. An extended period of economic disruption, however, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and overall financial condition.
Overview
The Company is a leading multi-brand restaurant company that develops, markets and acquires fast-casual and premium-casual dining restaurant concepts around the world, including corporate-owned stores and franchises. As of December 31, 2021, we were the owner and franchisor of the two following brands:
BurgerFi. BurgerFi is a fast-casual “better burger” concept, renowned for delivering an exceptional, all-natural premium “better burger” experience in a refined, contemporary environment. BurgerFi’s chef-driven menu offerings and eco-friendly restaurant design drive our brand communication. It offers a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, hand-cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally founded in 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida, the purpose was simple – “RedeFining” the way the world eats burgers by providing an upscale burger offering, at a fast-casual price point. BurgerFi is committed to an uncompromising and rewarding dining experience that promises fresh food of transparent quality. Since its inception, BurgerFi has grown to 118 BurgerFi locations, and as of December 31, 2021, is comprised of 25 corporate-owned restaurants and 93 franchised restaurants in 2 countries and 22 states, as well as Puerto Rico.
BurgerFi was named “Best Fast Casual Restaurant” in USA Today’s 10Best 2022 Readers Choice Awards for the second consecutive year, QSR Magazine's Breakout Brand of 2020, Fast Casual's 2021 #1 Brand of the Year and included in Inc. Magazine’s Fastest Growing Private Companies List. In 2021, Consumer Report’s Chain Reaction Report praised BurgerFi for serving “no antibiotic beef” across all its restaurants, and Consumer Reports awarded BurgerFi an "A-Grade Angus Beef" rating for the third consecutive year. 
Anthony’s. Anthony’s is a premium pizza and wing brand, operating 61 corporate-owned casual restaurant locations, as of December 31, 2021. Anthony’s prides itself on serving fresh, never frozen, high-quality ingredients. The concept is centered around a 900-degree coal fired oven, and its menu offers “well-done” pizza, coal fired chicken wings, homemade meatballs, and a variety of handcrafted sandwiches and salads. The restaurants also feature a deep wine and craft beer selection to round out the menu. The pizzas are prepared using a unique coal fired oven to quickly seal in natural flavors while creating a lightly charred crust. Anthony’s provides a differentiated offering among its casual dining peers driven by its coal fired oven, which enables the use of fresh, high-quality ingredients with quicker ticket times. 
Since its inception in 2002 in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, the Anthony’s brand has grown to 61 corporate-owned locations, as of December 31, 2021, primarily along the East coast and has restaurants in eight states, including Florida (28), Pennsylvania (12), New Jersey (8), New York (5), Massachusetts (4), Delaware (2), Maryland (1), and Rhode Island (1). 
Anthony’s was named “The Best Pizza Chain in America" by USA Today's Great American Bites and “Top 3 Best Major Pizza Chain” by Mashed in 2021. 
Beyond our current brand portfolio, we intend to acquire other restaurant concepts that will allow us to grow and also offer additional food categories. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we specifically seek concepts with, among others, the following characteristics:
•established, recognized brands;
•long-term, sustainable operating performance;
•consistent cash flows; and
•growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio.
Intending to leverage our developing management platform, we expect to achieve cost synergies post-acquisition by reducing the corporate overhead of the acquired company. We also plan to grow the top line revenues of newly acquired brands through support from our management and systems platform, franchising, marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support.
Corporate-owned restaurants
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, average sales for our matured corporate-owned restaurants (stores open for greater than 2 years) were approximately $1.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively, at BurgerFi, and $2.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively, at Anthony’s. At BurgerFi, we typically operate in a 2,200 to 2,400 square foot leased endcap and, to a lesser extent, free-standing or in-line space. For Anthony’s, we operate in an approximately 3,200 square foot leased endcap and, to a lesser extent, free-standing or in-line space, although we are developing a smaller footprint concept for Anthony’s that we plan to use in future locations. The Company does not own any real estate; we lease all our corporate-owned restaurant locations. Our lease term is generally ten to twenty years, plus two to four five-year options. Our build-out costs for BurgerFi range from $0.6 million to $1.1 million but typically cost approximately $0.8 million. Our build-out costs consist of leasehold improvements, kitchen equipment, furniture, point of sale and computer equipment, security equipment and signage.
Franchised restaurants
With respect to the BurgerFi brand, we currently use a franchising strategy to drive new restaurant growth in new and established markets, allowing for brand expansion without significant capital investment. The Company continues to evaluate its BurgerFi portfolio to determine the proper balance between corporate-owned restaurants and franchises. Moreover, the Company is excited about the recent Anthony’s acquisition and intends to launch Anthony’s franchising in 2022. As of December 31, 2021, there were a total of 93 BurgerFi franchised restaurants. Franchisees range in size from single restaurant operators to multi-unit operators. As of December 31, 2021, franchisees owned an average of 2 locations.
We believe that franchise revenue provides stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to continue expanding our base of franchised restaurants. In established markets, we encourage continued growth from current franchisees and assist them in identifying and securing new locations. In emerging and new markets, we intend to source qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. We generally seek franchisees from successful, non-competitive brands operating within the expansion markets. 
The BurgerFi Brands Difference – Purpose & Beliefs
The overall success of the Company and its brands is tied to consistent delivery by our corporate-owned restaurants and franchise operators of freshly prepared, better-for-you, high-quality menu items that our customers desire. With the input of our customers and franchisees, we continually strive to keep an updated perspective on our brands, including by strengthening our existing menu offerings and introducing new items. When updating our menu items and other offerings, we strive to ensure that changes are consistent with the core identity and attributes of our brands. In conjunction with our franchised restaurant operators, we are committed to delivering authentic, consistent experiences that have strong brand identity with customers. 
In addition, the Company is committed to creating an inclusive and equitable environment that supports the growth and success of our team members from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, genders, races, experiences, and more. These beliefs are an integral part of sharing and promoting a culture of inclusion within the organization and beyond.
In pursuing acquisitions and entering new restaurant brands, we intend to ensure consistent values with new restaurant concepts. As our restaurant portfolio continues to grow, we believe that both our franchisees and customers will recognize and support this ongoing commitment as they enjoy differing brand offerings.
In particular, a summary of the purpose and belief of each of the BurgerFi and Anthony’s brands is as follows:
BurgerFi Brand. At BurgerFi, our purpose is simple: BurgerFication [Bur-ger-Fi-ca-tion], which means that we are “RedeFining the way the world eats burgers.” Our team members are trained to understand and live the BurgerFi Beliefs: Be All Natural, Be Courageous, Be Excellent, Be Family, Be Thoughtful, and Be You. We believe that our Purpose and Beliefs are the foundational components of our culture and that is key to the way we run our business – these beliefs guide our behaviors in how we act and interact with one another, our vendors, and our communities.
One of our core beliefs at BurgerFi is “Be Natural,” because all-natural simply tastes better. BurgerFi uses only the best ingredients: our domestically served freshly-ground beef comes from farms where cattle are humanely raised, vegetarian fed, and never exposed to steroids, antibiotics, or growth hormones – ever. In addition, we have developed our proprietary VegeFi burger and specialty made sauces. This all-natural experience is also present in our belief in the sustainability of the environment. For instance, there are many fixtures and furnishings inside that tell a story of sustainability like upcycled furniture items, such as our 111 Navy Coca-Cola chairs, or our energy efficient Macro Air fans and our LED lighting that reduce our overall carbon footprint. 
At BurgerFi, we believe that people and families are at the heart of everything we do. To be family also extends beyond the four walls of our restaurants to include our loyal guests, vendors, and the communities within which we are embedded. We instill our family philosophy with all our team members from the moment they begin the recruitment process to BurgerFi all the way through their employee life cycle.
Anthony’s Brand. At Anthony’s, the beliefs are very similar to those of BurgerFi, which is one of the reasons why we acquired it in 2021. At Anthony’s, we are committed to quality by using fresh ingredients – never frozen - and preparing many items by hand. Anthony’s prides itself on the responsible sourcing to obtain the freshest foods so it can deliver high-quality products, including premium pizzas and roasted jumbo wings – from the most flavorful canned Italian tomatoes for our handmade sauce to mozzarella cheese from Wisconsin. In serving the freshest ingredients, as well as helping support the local communities in which we serve, we source our fresh tomatoes locally. Our natural ingredients also include a gluten-free pizza crust option.
We live by the mottos “made with love” and “made with care.” As with BurgerFi, the Anthony’s brand believes that people and family are also a top priority – from the guests to the employees, as well as the communities in which they operate. This is one of the reasons why Anthony’s has the “first-slice” mentality – always serving the customer the first slice of pizza as if they are home with their family.
Competitive Strengths
 We believe the Company’s competitive strengths, among others, include the following:
•Two Leading, Differentiated Brands Serving High-Quality, Freshly Prepared Foods with Broad Customer Appeal. Our BurgerFi and Anthony’s brands are differentiated from other dining options and offer distinct concepts and fresh, natural menu choices that we believe have broad consumer appeal, which attract a diverse customer base and drive guest loyalty. BurgerFi and Anthony’s are committed to our brand voice: serving freshly prepared, all-natural food using quality ingredients, including BurgerFi’s American Wagyu beef and 100% natural, cage-free chicken from all-natural farms. At Anthony’s, our 900-degree coal fired oven sets us apart from other premium pizza brands. At BurgerFi, we believe our premium wine and craft beer selection also differentiates us from the other fast-casual burger concepts. As such, we believe we are uniquely positioned to offer premium products at a premium price, including with chef-driven menu offerings, as well as eco-friendly restaurant design at the BurgerFi brand.
•“Conscious Consumer” Market. We believe that many consumers and investors want to associate with brands that have a heightened commitment to environmental and social practices. As the younger generations continue to grow and exercise their spending powers towards higher quality, authentic brands, we believe the Company will become a destination for those consumers and investors whose beliefs align with ours continuing the cult-like status we believe we have obtained. BurgerFi believes in clean, transparent, and sustainable restaurant ecosystems, which includes a full commitment to the humane treatment of animals. Moreover, environmental sustainability guides our decision-making when it comes to BurgerFi restaurant construction and design. From using number two southern pine lumber, some of the most renewable wood on the planet, to our energy efficient appliances, BurgerFi constantly looks at the ways in which we can minimize our environmental footprint.
•Management Platform for Growth. We are developing a management and systems platform designed to support the expansion of our existing brands while enabling the efficient acquisition and integration of additional restaurant concepts. We dedicate our resources and industry knowledge to promote the success of our franchisees, offering them various support services such as marketing and advertising, supply chain assistance, site selection analysis, staff training and operational oversight and support. Furthermore, we are developing our platform to be scalable and adaptable, allowing us to incorporate new concepts into the Company with minimal incremental corporate costs. We intend to grow our existing brands as well as make strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that complement our existing portfolio of concepts providing an entrance into targeted restaurant segments. 
•Seasoned New Management Team. Our expanding management team and employees are critical to our success. Our new senior leadership team is highly experienced in the restaurant industry. In addition, through their holdings, our senior executives, as well as our Executive Chairman, own significant equity interests in the Company, ensuring longer-term commitment and alignment with our public shareholders. Our management team is complemented by an accomplished Board of Directors that is highly involved in overseeing our strategic initiatives and implementation.
Growth Strategies
Our long-term strategy is focused on profitably building our base brands and growing new distribution channels, including franchised locations and acquiring new concepts. We believe the Company’s growth strategies primarily include the following:
•Opportunistically Acquire New Brands. We are developing a management platform to cost-effectively scale new restaurant concept acquisitions. Our recent acquisition of Anthony’s is the first example of this growth strategy. We seek concepts with established, widely recognized brands; steady cash flows; stable relationships with franchisees; sustainable operating performance; and growth potential, both geographically and through co-branding initiatives across our portfolio. 
•Enhance Existing Markets. We anticipate that our new and existing franchisees will continue to expand further as we focus our efforts on the franchise business, including our planned launch of the Anthony’s franchise brand in 2022. We plan to leverage our position as a leading “better burger” and “premium pizza and wings” concept in Florida, as well as along the Eastern seaboard and other important markets in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Many of our franchisees have grown their businesses over time, increasing the number of stores operated in their organizations. To capitalize on these relationships, we also hope to be able to cross-sell concepts across the Company’s brands.
•Increasing Same-Store Sales. In addition to opening new corporate-owned and franchise locations, we continue to focus on driving increases in same-store sales performance by providing exciting guest experiences that include new seasonal and other specific offerings, including loyalty rewards and our growing customer databases; continued service of freshly prepared, better-for-you, high-quality menu items; and technological upgrades like the BurgerFi-owned app and web, as well as third-party ordering and delivery services.
•Drive Store Growth Through Cloud Kitchens and Virtual Restaurants. In addition to testing concepts and driving growth through virtual restaurants at both brands, including Anthony’s The Roasted Wing concept that is available currently through third-party delivery services at all Anthony’s locations, we are leveraging the current industry trend of “cloud” or “ghost” kitchens. In a cloud kitchen, the restaurants open without a customer-facing store-front solely for the purpose of servicing delivery. Virtual restaurants and cloud kitchens allow us to introduce our brands in geographic areas where previously unknown to grow our brand more efficiently.
•Non-Traditional Partnerships and International Expansion. In recent years BurgerFi has begun targeting non-traditional venues for restaurant locations, such as airports, transportation hubs, toll roads, higher education, military bases, and sporting venues. The Company also intends to continue modestly growing its international market with established franchisees, including in Saudi Arabia.
Franchise Program
Overview
While the Company intends to launch the Anthony’s franchises in 2022 and leverage the BurgerFi brand franchise program, systems, and knowledge, it currently only franchises the BurgerFi brand. The following is an overview of the BurgerFi franchise program. 
BurgerFi uses a franchising strategy to augment new restaurant growth in new and established markets, allowing for brand expansion without significant internal capital investment. Our first franchise location was opened in 2012. As of December 31, 2021, there were a total of 93 franchised restaurants in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Saudi Arabia. Franchisees range in size from single restaurant operators to multi-unit operators, the largest of which owns 8 locations. For a BurgerFi location, the current franchise agreement reflects a 10-year term and provides for an initial franchise fee per store and a royalty fee of 5.5% of net sales. In addition, the franchisee must also pay an advertising fee of 2.0% of net sales. 
We believe that franchise revenue provides stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to continue expanding the base of franchise operated restaurants. In established markets, we will encourage continued growth from current franchisees and assist them in identifying and securing new locations. In emerging and new markets, we will source qualified and experienced new franchisees for multi-unit development opportunities. Although historically we’ve had a significant blend of one to two store franchise operators in our system, in expansion markets we will strive to seek franchisees from successful, non-competitive brands operating within those markets. We market franchise opportunities through strategic networking, participation in select industry conferences, high profile sales campaigns, our existing website, printed materials, and geo-targeted digital ads.
We have several forums to enhance participation and engagement with our franchise community, including a Franchise Advisory Council (“FAC”) to enhance participation and engagement with the franchise community. The FAC provides input and feedback on operating and marketing strategy and initiatives. FAC works with their group of franchise constituents to communicate and collaborate with the Company, providing input, feedback, and marketing strategy and system wide initiatives. Cross-functional teams comprised of company operators, franchise operators and executive team members collaborate to enhance vendor relationships and negotiate favorable scenarios for both the BurgerFi system and our vendors.
Franchise Owner Support
We have structured our corporate staff, training programs, operational systems, and communication systems to ensure we are delivering strong, effective support to our franchisees. We assist franchisees with the site selection process, and every new franchise location is scrutinized by our corporate real estate team. We provide template plans franchisees may use for new restaurant construction and work with franchisees and their design and construction vendors to ensure compliance with brand specifications. A training program is required for all franchisees, operating partners, and management staff. Training materials introduce new franchisees to our operational performance standards and the metrics that help maintain these high standards.
For the first two restaurant openings for a new franchisee, we typically provide significant on-site support, with more modest support for subsequent openings for that franchisee. On an ongoing basis, we collect and disseminate customer experience feedback on a real time basis through a third-party vendor. We also conduct regular on-site audits at each franchise location, although in the COVID-19 environment we sometimes perform our internal inspections through video collaboration with a third-party vendor who physically inspects each location and timely provides us with its full report. Our regional operations leaders are dedicated to ongoing franchise support and oversight, regularly visiting each franchise territory. Our marketing department assists franchisees with local marketing programs and guidance with our national marketing campaigns. We typically communicate with franchisees through our company newsletter, which is published monthly and hold weekly inter-active webinar meetings to update our franchisee teams and conduct additional training. In the past, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we plan to begin again, we also held a bi-annual summit for franchisees, vendors, and company operations leaders to review overall performance, celebrate shared success, communicate best practices, and plan for the year ahead.
Site Selection
The Company’s real estate department functions in a manner consistent with the overall Company purpose and beliefs. This is evidenced by the holistic, rigorous approach of our site selection criteria. We actively assist in the search of specific, strategically selected markets for potential new locations. In each selected market, we evaluate these initial sites using the various criteria, including demographic, psychographic and competitive analysis, visibility, access, and signage, traffic counts, anchor and co-tenants, ample parking, and flexible footprints.
Our strategy is to cluster multiple locations in a demographic market area. We believe this clustering allows efficiencies in labor, including knowledge base, “pro-teams,” cross-training and developing and training new managers. Additionally, we believe this clustering allows better leverage in media buying, brand awareness, and culture. We target demographics with high concentrations of well-educated consumers, with above average income levels, who care about what they eat. Beyond our great food, BurgerFi offers our target consumers a contemporary restaurant design with eco-friendly fixtures and upcycled furniture. Our wholesome atmosphere is thoughtfully designed to enhance the guest experience and to complement shopping centers and communities as well.
While we are exploring smaller footprint restaurants to help increase optionality, improve unit economics, and expand the total addressable market, BurgerFi’s ideal footprint typically has been 2,200 to 2,400 square feet, usually an endcap in a shopping center. In selecting a site, we closely study key physical attributes, as well as trade area and other comparative data, to assess the quality and viability of a location. Each potential site is analyzed and reviewed using AI software. The best locations are analyzed for their internal rate of return using multiple projected sales scenarios. We believe that aggressive and ongoing market review, coupled with detailed analysis, should provide a consistent stream of great locations for ongoing future development.
Construction & Design
Once a site is successfully permitted, a BurgerFi restaurant can be built generally in approximately a 90-working day period. During these 90 working days, all construction is completed, and the space is then turned over to the operational team. We team up with several general contractors regionally throughout the country and strive to effectively manage the bidding process of each project to ensure quality standards are kept up to par.
BurgerFi restaurants feature an inviting, next-gen look and feel, appealing to consumers of all ages seeking an engaging, high-quality dining experience. There are many fixtures and furnishings inside that tell a story of sustainability like upcycled furniture items, such as our 111 Navy Coca-Cola chairs, or our energy efficient Macro Air fans and LED lighting that reduce our overall carbon footprint. These products and materials are sourced through our preferred vendors to meet the needs of the restaurants. 
The main design goal at BurgerFi is to provide an updated, sleek look that is practical for our customers and provides them with a warm inviting feel. Over the years we have gone through small design evolutions within the restaurant walls to not only better suit the needs of our guests but also the needs of our team members. We strive to please our guests and in doing so need to create an open space with great quality materials that can be easily cleaned and will withstand the wear and tear of time.
Like most restaurants, we have learned that the delivery channel is an opportunity to innovate our kitchen design. We have worked to equip our kitchens with a layout that is both effective and efficient at increasing our output of products. We have vetted certain equipment pieces that allow us to keep up with desired cook times while providing the best possible end-product for the guest.
Over the years, the Company has been very adaptive with its direction of growth. As we move forward, we are continually evaluating the overall size of our design so we can better fit into non-traditional, spaces that, in addition to potential operational savings, give us greater visibility.
Supply Chain
Sourcing. The Company’s philosophy is to work with best-in-class suppliers across our supply chain so that we can always provide top quality, better-for-you food for our guests. 
For BurgerFi’s meat, we source currently from some of best ranches in the United States including Meyer Company Ranch, Snake River Farms, and Springer Mountain Farms, who share in our commitment to all-natural food, with no hormones or antibiotics, that is humanely raised and source verified. In 2021, in Consumer Report’s Chain Reaction Report, BurgerFi was praised for serving “no antibiotic beef” across all its restaurants, and Consumer Reports awarded BurgerFi an "A-Grade Angus Beef" rating for the third consecutive year. In addition, our bread is free of synthetic chemicals, our ketchup is free of corn syrup, and we use cage-free eggs. At BurgerFi we ensure that our beef is always freshly ground at all domestic locations.
At Anthony’s, we are also committed to using fresh ingredients and take pride in our sourcing. We do not use freezers for any of our products to ensure the best quality food for the customer. In addition, by sourcing locally where available, such as our fresh tomatoes and our sausage, we strive to bring the freshest ingredients so we can deliver high-quality products.
Distribution. Currently the Company contracts with several distributors to provide its food distribution services in the United States for both of the Anthony’s and BurgerFi brands. As the Company continues to integrate the acquisition of Anthony’s, it has been leveraging, and intends to continue to leverage, the increased scale of the Company to consolidate distributors and obtain more favorable optimization and costs. 
For BurgerFi, we utilize 29 affiliated distribution centers to supply our domestic corporate-owned and franchised restaurants. For Anthony’s, we utilize 11 affiliated distribution centers to supply our corporate-owned restaurants. We regularly assess our broadline distributor to ensure our strict safety and quality standards are met and that the prices they offer are competitive.
Food Safety. Food safety is of the utmost importance. Within our restaurants we have stringent food safety and quality protocols that help our teams ensure they are providing a safe place to eat for our guests and team members alike. Utilizing in-house temperature and quality audits throughout the day, we strive to verify that all products are safe and of highest quality. Additionally, we use third-party auditing systems, designed to ensure we meet or exceed local health standards. These audits are completed periodically and without notice with the goal of ensuring that our restaurants maintain our high standards at all hours of the day. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have initiated additional COVID-19 protocol audits.
Management Information Systems. Our traditional corporate-owned and franchised restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems that are designed specifically for the restaurant industry. In addition, as discussed further below, some BurgerFi locations also offer guest facing self-ordering kiosk technology. Both point-of-sales systems provide touch screen interfaces, order confirmation displays, kitchen displays and integrated, high-speed credit card, gift card and loyalty program processing. The information collected from the point-of-sale system includes daily transaction data, which generates information about sales, average transaction size as well as product mix information. This system allows our management teams to run various reports and access vital information to assist them in controlling food and labor costs daily.
Technology-Enhanced Brand
Integral to our purpose, the Company harnesses innovation and technology to offer our guests opportunities to enjoy our food when and where they want. In addition to ordering in-restaurant at the counter, guests can enjoy BurgerFi or Anthony’s currently by ordering through six different digital platforms:
•Pick-Up: Customers can order for pick-up through the BurgerFi app, ACFP.com, BurgerFi.com or through marketplace pick-up platforms, such as, Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. Additionally, at Anthony’s, we are testing phone AI at limited locations;
•First Party Delivery: Customers can order through the BurgerFi app, ACFP.com, or BurgerFi.com for delivery through our delivery affiliations, which generally offers lower pricing than through marketplace delivery;
•Marketplace: Our third-party delivery affiliations include Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Grubhub, with several smaller regional associations;
•Ghost Kitchen Delivery: Licensees operate kitchens to BurgerFi food specifications and delivery through marketplaces. This allows for a broader BurgerFi footprint and delivery further away from traditional stores;
•Virtual Brands: We are exploring virtual brands, including Anthony’s The Roasted Wing, that offers select food options through marketplace offerings. This broadens our horizontal reach within the marketplace; and
•In-Store: We allow digital purchases at the register using a QR code. We also have select stores with next-generation kiosks, which, during the initial trial, have indicated higher check average versus the traditional person-to-person interaction.
We believe these different platforms allow us to connect with guests in intuitive, customizable, and meaningful ways, including through a custom loyalty program tailored to reward users with offers based on their preferences, frequency, and order history. 
Other technology and innovation ideas that the Company are testing include an in-car voice-activated ordering system available in certain 5G enabled vehicles, as well as new gas-assisted pizza ovens at Anthony’s.
Competition
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, and food quality. It is often affected by changes in consumer trends, economic conditions, demographics, traffic patterns, and concern about the nutritional content of fast-casual and casual foods. Furthermore, there are many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial resources, including several national, regional, and local fast casual and casual dining restaurants. The restaurant industry also has few barriers to entry and new competitors may emerge at any time. 
We believe that, among others, product quality and taste, convenience of location, and brand differentiation and recognition are among the most important competitive factors in the fast-casual and casual restaurant segment and that our two brands compete effectively. Our brand voice, derived from our commitment to fresh, better-for-you food, emphasizes the Company Purpose and Beliefs to team members, guests and stakeholders alike. The Company remains committed to these values, and we believe our guests understand our dedication to the values and causes that are important to them. 
Seasonality
Outside of our Florida locations where we experience some seasonality based on increased tourism from approximately November through April, our corporate-owned stores and franchisees have not historically experienced significant seasonal variability in their financial performance.
Intellectual Property
We own, domestically and internationally, valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other proprietary information related to our restaurant and corporate brands. This intellectual property includes logos and trademarks which are of material importance to our business. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks and service marks generally are valid as long as they are used and/or registered. We seek to actively protect and defend our intellectual property from infringement and misuse.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, our team members consisted of 2,422 employees, including 834 full-time employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. 
Government Regulation
The Company and its franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state, and local government levels. These include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, zoning and building codes, franchising, land use and employee, health, sanitation, and safety matters. The Company and its franchisees are required to obtain and maintain a wide variety of governmental licenses, permits and approvals. Difficulty or failure in obtaining them in the future could result in delaying or canceling the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our governmental licenses if they determine that the Company’s operations do not meet the standards for initial grant or renewal. Our restaurants outside the U.S. are subject to national and local laws and regulations which are similar to those affecting U.S. restaurants. The restaurants outside the U.S. are also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.
The Company is also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and subject to state laws that govern the offer, sale, renewal and termination of franchises and its relationship with its franchisees. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on franchise sales, fines or the requirement that the Company make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could affect our ability to open new restaurants in the future and thus could materially adversely affect its business and operating results. Any such failure could also subject the Company to liability to its franchisees.
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.
