ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Leader Capital Holdings Corp. is a company that operates through its wholly owned subsidiary, Leader Financial Group Limited, a Seychelles Company. It should be noted that our wholly owned subsidiary, Leader Financial Group Limited owns 100% of JFB Internet Service Limited, a Hong Kong Company.
 
At this time, we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary and share the same business plan of our subsidiary which is to function as the service provider of an investment platform. JFB Internet Service Limited owns the JFB mobile application. JFB is a platform that connects investor with other financial service providers in an effort to sharpen operational efficiency and respond to customer demands for more innovative services. It is a ready-made application to meet generic needs of financial service providers, especially for trust companies and insurance companies. Some degree of customization can be added to brand the application to better suit the client’s requirements. The JFB application has completed development, but we may evaluate the possibility of improving the application as time goes on. Additionally, it should be noted that the Company has not yet generated any revenue, and we currently operate at a net loss.
 
In traditional investing, the investors have to screen and analyze financial information and economic data across time zones and regions. They have to gauge market sentiment in order to decide whether or not to invest and also struggle to handle rapid risk management decisions to manage losses as they cannot check their investment portfolio value in a timely manner. The JFB investment platform can help to resolve all of these problems.
 
JFB Application intends to, in the future, cooperate with trust companies and will help clients of these sales channels to review assets in their trust account at any time. The investors can use their trust accounts to purchase a wide range of investment products, including regulatory insurance policies and registered funds through the JFB Application. In this way, the JFB Application can reduce the workload of these sales channels. The investors can also use it to instruct their own trust accounts to make investments, without mailing and faxing, so that the investor can rapidly place investment orders ahead of others in an efficient way. The investment platform is a combination of traditional investment wisdom and advanced technology helping investors grasp investment opportunities ahead. Also, our innovative investment platform is well equipped with robust, comprehensive and real-time information.
 
The application is sleek and user-friendly and includes the following features:
 
1. Keep track of the user’s Investment portfolio
 2. Show Insurance Policy details
 3. Enable an investor to link virtually any trust account to check their balance
 4. Show other financial products of the company.
 5. The latest news
 6. Financial Analysis from industry experts
 7. Customize the background and the layout of the Application
 8. Online Customer Service
 
In the future, the Company anticipates that the major source of revenue of the JFB Application will be generated from commissions received from trust companies. When a client sets up a trust account, he or she should pay a set up and annual fee for his or her account. The trust company will cooperate with JFB and share some percentage, which has not yet been finalized, of this income with JFB.
Competition
 
Fintech investment service providers has begun to grow rapidly around the world. The mobile applications that are found in the market mostly provide direct services to a single company and the investors can only choose that company’s products. Conversely, JFB can offer different companies products in the application and some tailor-made elements according to the user.

Marketing
 
The main marketing strategy of JFB is to develop various sales channels from our clients, such as insurance broker sales teams, real estate broker sales teams, social group sales teams or security broker sales teams etc. They are all welcome to join the JFB Platform. The Company will utilize the existing business connections of our Officers and Directors in order to market our application initially. Most sales teams do not have IT resources and software to manage their sales. JFB intends to provide IT services and software to help these team leaders manage their teams and bring the JFB application to their end user clients. Thus, team leaders and sales persons can reduce their administration workload from clients.
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2018, we, Leader Capital Holdings Corp., have two part time employees, all of which make up our Officers and Directors. Additionally, our subsidiary, JFB Internet Service Limited, has hired ten salaried employees comprised of one accountant, one art designer and three sales administrative assistants.
 
Currently, our Officers and Directors each have the flexibility to work on our business up to 25 to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary.
 
We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officers/ or director.
