Item 1. Business.

Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “our,” “us,” “ZIVO,” “the Registrant” or “the Company” refer to Zivo Bioscience, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries.

Overview

We are a research and development company operating in both the biotech and agtech sectors, with an intellectual property portfolio comprised of proprietary algal and bacterial strains, biologically active molecules and complexes, production techniques, cultivation techniques and patented or patent-pending inventions for applications in human and animal health. 
Biotech – ZIVO Product Candidates

ZIVO is developing bioactive compounds derived from its proprietary algal culture, targeting human and animal diseases, such as poultry coccidiosis, bovine mastitis, human cholesterol, and canine osteoarthritis. As part of its strategy, ZIVO will continue to seek strategic partners for late stage development, regulatory preparation and commercialization of its products in key global markets.
Agtech – ZIVO’s Algal Biomass

ZIVO’s algal biomass is currently produced in Peru. ZIVO’s algal biomass contains Vitamin A, protein, iron, important fatty acids, non-starch polysaccharides and other micronutrients that position the product as a viable functional food ingredient and nutritional enhancement for human and animal use and as a viable functional ingredient for skin care products, such as mists, gommages, facial masks and serums. The Company currently has contracts for the sale of its algal biomass, however, no sales have been made pursuant to these contracts at this time and we don’t expect any sales to be made until we expand production of our algal biomass. 
Poultry Gut Health

ZIVO’s initial focus is on developing a product candidate designed to target poultry gut health. ZIVO has conducted multiple poultry clinical trials to develop and refine a treatment for coccidiosis, a condition that inflames the digestive tracts of poultry, currently treated with various antibiotics, antimicrobials and chemicals. 
Additional Indications

                Pending additional funding, ZIVO may also pursue the following indications:

Our Market Opportunity 

Biotech

Poultry Gut Health

Coccidiosis, or the inflammation of the intestinal tract, is one of the largest health and animal welfare problems facing poultry flocks. Roughly $3.0 billion was spent in 2006 to control this condition, of which antibiotics and antimicrobials comprise a significant percentage. Consumer and regulatory pressure have created what we believe to be an opportunity to develop and market an alternative to various additives routinely mixed into chicken feed. The Company is developing a product candidate designed to boost immune response, thereby combatting a broad range of infective pathogens, with the goal of simultaneously improving feed conversion and productivity. 

The annual market sizes for vaccines, phytogenics and eubiotics in the animal health market as a whole were approximately $9.2 billion in 2020, $753.0 million in 2020, and $3.9 billion in 2019, respectively. During the same time period, the annual market sizes for drugs, vaccines & feed additives and supplements in the companion animal market were approximately $11.8 billion in 2020 and $637.6 million in 2019, respectively. 

Bovine Mastitis

Bovine mastitis, or inflammation of the udder, can halt milk production and may result in unsaleable milk. The U.S. cow herd averaged 9.4 million cows in 2018 and U.S. milk production hit 217.6 billion pounds in 2018. Bovine mastitis affects approximately 1.5 million out of the 9 million dairy cows in the U.S. on an annual basis, and the average loss per cow per year in milk output is 846 pounds. Current treatments are primarily antibiotic, which requires a holding period and disposal of milk during that holding period. 
Canine Joint Health

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common ailments among pet dogs, with prevalence believed to be greater than 20%. The U.S. is expected to hold the largest share of the global market for veterinary pain management due to the vast pet population in the region, increasing animal healthcare expenditure, large number of hospitals and clinics, growing pool of veterinarians, and high prevalence of diseases causing pain. According to IBISWorld, the U.S. veterinary services market showed a solid, steady increase in consumer spending over the past few years.
Human Immune Modification

Immune-related and infectious diseases represent a vast range of health issues affecting millions of humans and animals. New applications in pharma, food and nutraceuticals are continually introduced into this growing market. The annual market sizes for the antibiotics, eubiotics, autoimmune, and the antidiabetic markets were approximately $40.0 billion in 2020, $37.9 billion in 2019, $110.0 billion in 2017 and $48.8 billion in 2018, respectively. Beyond arthritis, there are more than 80 types of clinically different autoimmune diseases. Many major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies have extensive licensing and development programs focused on autoimmune/anti-inflammatory R&D. The rise in strategic alliances by discovery stage R&D companies like ZIVO is one of the latest trends that may gain traction in the autoimmune and anti-inflammatory therapeutics market in the coming years.

Human Functional Food Ingredients

The market for healthy foods, health foods, vegan and vegetarian food products continues to gain traction in the US and worldwide, especially as consumers look for healthful and nutritional ingredients to improve overall health and immune response. The drive toward plant-based proteins and microbiome-enhancing natural foods and food/beverage ingredients and dietary supplements continues to expand.
Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway

Clinical Experience, Future Development and Clinical Trial Plans

Our algal biomass product is at different stages of development for different applications. Accordingly, the various regulatory processes required for the various applications are at different stages of completion. With respect to human food and beverage applications, we have completed the FDA’s self-affirmed GRAS process for our dried algal biomass which allows for product commercialization with a consumption limit of up to nine grams per day. 

Beyond use of the dried algal biomass for use in human food and beverage in the U.S., ZIVO has not received the required approvals for commercialization in the U.S. or any other country for any product form or application beyond nutritional claims. To date, however, the Company has performed a number of bench top and pre-clinical tests (which include animal testing, performance, and other tests required by regulatory bodies) for various product forms and applications pertinent to qualified health claims and structure/function claims. As described below, the Company intends to perform additional testing of its product in connection with obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals.

Poultry Gut Health

The Company initially intends to develop a product candidate targeted at poultry gut health. The Company has conducted 20 clinical trials to date, most recently in the second half of 2021. The early studies focused on determining the general effects from our product candidates, while the more recent studies examined dosage levels, interactions with vaccines and various product formulations. The Company expects to conduct several more studies on behalf of prospective licensees as part of licensing negotiations.
Potential Additional Indications

Following development of our initial product candidate, the Company intends to continue to pursue the below indications:

Material Agreements

Zoetis Collaboration/Option Agreement 

On December 20, 2013, the Company entered into a collaboration, confidentiality and option agreement with Zoetis (as amended from time to time, the “Zoetis Agreement”), formerly Pfizer Animal Health, and the world’s largest animal health company, pursuant to which the Company is conducting bovine mastitis research. 

Under the Zoetis Agreement, the Company granted Zoetis an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with the Company for Company proprietary technology for bovine mastitis, including its identified and characterized natural molecule and its synthetic fatty acid/polysaccharide complex, and derivatives/homologs/isomers thereof, and production of the same (the “Technology”). The Company is required to execute a study under the supervision of Zoetis, the results of which will be used by Zoetis to evaluate whether or not to exercise its option. Within 90 days of its receipt of results, Zoetis must notify the Company whether or not it wishes to secure an exclusive license, and the negotiation of such license and payment terms will be made at that time.

The Zoetis Agreement has been extended through seven amendments, with the current term set to expire on January 30, 2023. 

NutriQuest Collaborative Marketing Agreement

In April 2017, the Company entered into a limited license agreement with animal nutrition innovator NutriQuest (the “NutriQuest Agreement”), which holds feed formulation contracts with Tyson, Purdue, Smithfield and other large poultry and pork processors around the world. Poultry feed testing has shown that the Company’s proprietary algal strain may be a natural immune modulator that may enter the market as a natural products or phytogenic feed ingredient, providing the No Antibiotics Ever (“NAE”) producers with a non-medicated feed alternative. 

Under the NutriQuest Agreement, ZIVO granted to NutriQuest a limited, exclusive license to market, distribute sell and collect the sales proceeds in all ZIVO’s nutrition, feed additive and supplementation applications naturally-derived algal biomass and extraction products (collectively the “Products”) for oral administration in poultry and swine. The Products will be sold under the NutriQuest brand, with logos and packaging chosen by NutriQuest, with NutriQuest marketing, distributing and collecting revenues from sales of the Products. The parties will equally share the gross profit.

We also have allowed pending trademark applications for “KALGAE,” “ZIVO”, and “ZIVO Bioscience” in several countries. We may have other common law rights in other trademarks, trade names, service marks, and the like which will continue as long as we use those respective marks.

Patents

The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or parent application, if applicable). For example, if an international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) application is filed, any patent issuing from the PCT application in a specific country expires 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application. In the United States, using the Paris Convention route, if a patent was in force on June 8, 1995, or issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, that patent will have a term that is the greater of 20 years from the filing date, or 17 years from the date of issue.

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension (“PTE”). PTE permits restoration of a portion of the patent term of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process if approval of the application for the product is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug or biological product containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug (IND) and the submission date of a biological license application (“BLA”) plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE for only one patent applicable to an approved drug, and the maximum period of restoration is five years beyond the expiration of the patent. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and a patent can only be extended once, and thus, even if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for PTEs for patents covering our therapeutic candidates and products and their methods of use.

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

Trade Secrets

We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any intellectual property or proprietary information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information.
Government Regulation

Overview

Biotech

As a discovery-stage licensor, we do not intend to fund and oversee the final regulatory approvals and commercialization processes of our product candidates, as we expect these to be borne by the licensee in all cases. 
Agtech

As the licensor of food technology, and producer of culture inoculum for cultivation, ZIVO and its licensed growers must furnish to customers algal biomass that is compliant with all food and feed standards and FDA/CVM/USDA/AAFCO regulations.

In all cases, the compliance efforts involve GRAS affirmation and potentially an FDA “No Objection” or “No Questions” letter for each target specie. ZIVO has already completed a Self-GRAS affirmation for human use.

The Company intends to monetize intellectual property via licensing and biomass sales to feed and food marketers, dietary supplement makers and pharmaceutical companies. In so doing, each individual application requires testing and validation of safety and, in some cases, efficacy, per established regulation. Market verticals and compliance standards are closely associated. It stands to reason that entering a particular vertical is based on the economic opportunity, tempered by the cost and complexity of complying with all relevant standards.

Feed Ingredients – Livestock and Poultry

Feed ingredients in the U.S. are nominally controlled by the AAFCO, under a working memorandum with the FDA, which provides enforcement (including litigation) on behalf of AAFCO. Recent actions by the FDA and CVM have complicated the compliance process, and in February 2018, Company principals engaged the Tox Strategies as compliance consultants for poultry GRAS self-affirmation. 

Because animal products make up a critical part of the food supply, anything that goes into dairy cows, beef cattle, pork or poultry is heavily regulated. In this instance, the Company intends to sell its dried algal biomass or extracts as a feed ingredient. It is incumbent upon the Company to prove that its algal culture is safe to consume by humans and provides nutritional value to the animal. No claims can be made regarding any of its beneficial properties beyond digestibility, nutrition and productivity.

In March 2019, ZIVO retained Pen & Tec, an animal feed compliance consultancy based in Portugal to assist in EU product registration. ZIVO dried algal biomass has since been classified as a feed material in the EU, requiring no new research or study, but a rather time-consuming process of product registration and importation protocols which is still in process as of December 31, 2021.

Feed Ingredients & Supplements – Companion Animals

Although state and AAFCO officials still regulate companion animal feeds, treats and supplements, the supervision and standards are largely handled by the FDA and the CVM on a national level. However, the standards are not as restrictive as livestock feed. We currently do not have approval to sell companion animal feeds and are in the process of developing the specie-specific safety and health data required to do so. Companion animal products are aimed primarily at dogs and horses. We believe that a single safety/tox study and a separate dose/benefit study per animal applications will be sufficient. As with humans, we would seek to obtain a GRAS affirmation. 

To clarify, an “application” is a single ingredient in a single formulation and a single claim for a single animal species. Therefore, a dietary supplement with the Company’s active compound, intended as a joint health supplement for adult dogs, constitutes a single application. That single application requires its own studies before any dog treat manufacturer would consider licensing or purchasing the Company’s active compounds. Any change to the claims (more energy, shinier coat, etc.) or the target specie requires a new study. This is the current state of regulation, and it holds true for all human and animal applications.

Food Ingredient – Human

The food ingredient industry is regulated by several federal agencies. Anything that is introduced into food or beverages, whether to prevent spoilage, optimize processing or to enhance its nutritive value, must meet standards set and enforced rigorously by the FDA and USDA.
GRAS

The FDA requires that ingredients introduced into human foods and beverages are safe and are manufactured in a consistent manner that guarantees consumer safety. The standard that the Company must meet for food ingredient safety is GRAS. The Company opted to complete the self-affirmed GRAS process for its algal biomass, and upon achieving this status, the biomass has been a lawful food ingredient. The Company may, at some time in the future, determine to submit notification of the GRAS status of its biomass to FDA in expectation that it will be filed following a determination that FDA has “no questions” concerning our data.

In 2016, ZIVO contracted the Burdock Group to assist the Company in the compliance process, and to help with the process with the FDA. Further, the Company retained the New York law firm of Ullman Shapiro Ullman LLP, now part of Rivkin-Radler LLP, to advise in the compliance process.

Current Good Manufacturing Process

The other standard that must be met is current Good Manufacturing Process (“cGMP”) before any ingredient can be introduced into foods and beverages. The Company is required to register as a producer of food and/or dietary supplement ingredients with FDA and will thus be subject to inspection by the agency for compliance with applicable cGMP regulations.

 In addition, there are numerous state and local licensing and inspection requirements. should the product be produced in the U.S. If produced overseas, the FDA, USDA and U.S. Customs require that each grower is enrolled in the Foreign Supplier Verification Program, a cost to be borne by the grower and ZIVO.

Dietary Supplements

Dietary supplements, which include vitamins, minerals, nutritive substances, and natural products that are standalone products (“nutraceuticals”) fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA and must comply with the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (“DSHEA”) legislation passed in 1994 and updated several times since, along with the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011.

NDI Application

As human dietary supplement applications are being readied for market launch, the Company is required to file a New Dietary Ingredient (NDI) Notification. The standard applied to NDI Notifications is “reasonable expectation of safety” for intended use as a supplement. As part of the notification process, ZIVO must conduct at least one human study, and possibly two. These studies can run concurrently but should not be conducted by the same clinical research organization. To date, ZIVO has not run these studies. One such study may be the same dose tolerance study planned to increase the maximum allowable consumption limit as discussed above. 

Skin Care and Topical Uses

The US Congress is contemplating implementation of a statute requiring all skin care and cosmetics production to follow GMP. If this legislation is passed the Company will need to ensure that it and any contract manufacturers are certified GMP.

Structure/Function Claims

The Company can go to market (once a single study has been completed and GMP protocols are in evidence) with simple structure/function claims regarding the ability to maintain a healthy immune response or a beneficial anti-inflammatory response. This is the most basic of FDA standards and essentially means that as long as GMP standards are met, a study has been conducted and that in-process toxicology reports are available, the Company is able to market its product.

The market reality is that nutraceutical and supplement makers won’t take on the product unless its chemical makeup is generally described, the plant or animal is properly classified (in this case, algae) and the manufacturing process is free of health hazards and that GMP protocols are observed, all of which the Company intends to meet or exceed.

USP Certification

The DSHEA regulations also require that a safe dosage is established for any vitamin, mineral or dietary supplement, whether it is natural or synthetic in composition. The United States Pharmacopeia (“USP”) is the official pharmacopeia of the United States. USP establishes written (documentary) and physical (reference) standards for medicines, food ingredients, dietary supplement products and ingredients.

These standards are used by regulatory agencies and manufacturers to help to ensure that these products are of the appropriate identity, as well as strength, quality, purity, and consistency. The Company will endeavor to adhere to the most basic USP standard in order to maintain speed to market. It or its licensees will then consider the USP Verified products designation.

Employees

As of December 31, 2021 we had 10 full-time employees, consisting of clinical development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, finance, administration and managers. We also regularly use independent contractors across the organization. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1983, under the name of “L. Peck Enterprises, Inc.” On May 27, 1999, we changed our name to “Western Glory Hole, Inc.” From 1990 until October 2003, we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities. On October 30, 2003, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Health Enhancement Corporation (“HEC”) in exchange for 112,500 of our shares, making HEC our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name to Health Enhancement Products, Inc. On October 14, 2014, at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, a proposal was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products, Inc. to Zivo Bioscience, Inc.. On October 30, 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority approved the name Zivo Bioscience, Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective November 10, 2014.
