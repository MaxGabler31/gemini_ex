ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Description of the Business of LFTD Partners Inc.

LFTD Partners Inc. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “LFTD Partners”, the “Company”, “LIFD”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”, etc.) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 2, 1986. Shares of the Company’s common stock are traded on the OTCQB Venture Market under the trading symbol LIFD. 

Our business is primarily focused upon acquiring rapidly growing companies that manufacture and sell branded, products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids (e.g. delta-8-THC, delta-9-THC, delta-10-THC, THCV, HHC, THCO, CBDA, CBC, CBG, CBN, and CBD), nicotine, kratom, kava and psychedelic products (a “Canna-Infused Products Company”). 

Management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of also acquiring operating businesses and/or assets involving products containing marijuana, distilled spirits, beer, wine, and real estate. In addition, management of the Company is open-minded to the concept of acquiring all or a portion of one or more operating businesses and/or assets that are considered to be “essential” businesses which are unlikely to be shut down by the government during pandemics such as COVID-19. From time to time, we engage in discussions with potential acquisition targets. 

To date, we have acquired 100% of the ownership interests in one Canna-Infused Products Company called Lifted Liquids, Inc. d/b/a Lifted Made (formerly Warrender Enterprise Inc. d/b/a Lifted Liquids) (www.LiftedMade.com), Kenosha, Wisconsin (“Lifted Made” or “Lifted”).

On April 30, 2019, we also closed on the acquisition of 4.99% of the common stock of each of CBD-infused beverages maker Ablis Holding Company (“Ablis”) (www.AblisCBD.com), and of distilled spirits manufacturers Bendistillery Inc. (“Bendistillery”)and Bend Spirits, Inc. (“Bend Spirits”), all located in Bend, Oregon.

Prior to February 9, 2022, Lifted Made had a 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC, which sells tobacco-free nicotine pouches under the brand name FR3SH (www.GETFR3SH.com). On February 9, 2022, Lifted Made sold its 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC to Corner Vapory LLC. For more information, please refer to NOTE 15 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

Termination of Letter of Intent relating to the proposed acquisition by the Company of Savage Enterprises, Premier Greens LLC and MKRC Holdings, LLC

On December 15, 2021, the Company, our Chairman and CEO Gerard M. Jacobs (“GJacobs”), our President and CFO William C. “Jake” Jacobs (“WJacobs”), and our Vice Chairman and COO Nicholas S. Warrender (“NWarrender”), Savage Enterprises, a Wyoming corporation (“Savage”), Premier Greens LLC, a California limited liability company (“Premier Greens”), MKRC Holdings, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“MKRC”), Christopher G. Wheeler (“Wheeler”), and Matt Winters (“Winters”), mutually stipulated to terminate the Letter of Intent dated June 15, 2021 that set out the Company’s possible acquisition of Savage, Premier Greens and MKRC. As a result, no acquisition of Savage, Premier Greens or MKRC by the Company will occur. 

Termination of Letter of Intent relating to the proposed acquisition by the Company of Fresh Farms E-Liquid, LLC

On December 16, 2021, the Company, Fresh Farms E-Liquid, LLC, a California limited liability company (“Fresh Farms”), Anthony J. Devincentis (“Devincentis”), Jakob M. Audino (“Audino”), Forrest F. Town (“Town”), John Z. Petti (“Petti”), GJacobs, NWarrender, WJacobs, Wheeler and Winters mutually stipulated to terminate the Letter of Intent dated September 1, 2021 that set out the Company’s possible acquisition of Fresh Farms. As a result, no acquisition of Fresh Farms by the Company will occur.

Capital Raise

Cash on hand is currently limited, so in order to close future acquisitions, it likely will be necessary for us to raise substantial additional capital, and no guarantee or assurance can be made that such capital can be raised on acceptable terms, if at all. 

With the assistance of an investment bank, we are currently exploring the possibility of raising $5 million or more through some combination of debt and equity offerings in order to pay off the remaining $2.75 million owed in connection with our acquisition of Lifted, to purchase for $1.375 million the building located at 5511 95th Avenue, Kenosha, Wisconsin, that is currently being rented by Lifted, to pay off all other liabilities of the Company and Lifted including certain bonuses and our company-wide bonus pool, and to pay transactional fees and expenses. If we proceed forward with an equity raise, it may be in conjunction with a potential listing of our common stock on a Canadian stock exchange. However, there can be no guarantee or assurance that any such debt and/or equity capital raise or listing will be completed on acceptable terms, if at all.

The Lifted Made Business

History 

Lifted was originally incorporated in the state of Wisconsin on September 19, 2014. Lifted was created with a passion to build a culture-based organization focused upon quality products and a healthier lifestyle. 
Products

Under its flagship brands Urb Finest Flowers and Silly Shruum, Lifted manufactures and sells hemp-derived products and other psychedelic products. 

Lifted also manufactures and sells similar hemp-derived products to private label clients. Lifted sells its Urb Finest Flowers brand of products and its private label clients’ products online primarily through www.LiftedMade.com. During 2020, our business also involved selling and distributing hand sanitizer, but it is unlikely that this hand sanitizer business will continue going forward. 
Officers and Employees

The executives of Lifted have backgrounds in the vaping industry, sales, graphic design, distribution, marketing, accounting, and supply chain management, skills that have helped Lifted distinguish itself from the competition. Prior to and following the worst months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lifted team has occasionally attended trade shows throughout the USA to promote Lifted’s products. In recent months, Lifted has begun attending more hemp industry trade shows throughout the USA. The Company holds an option to purchase NWarrender’s interests in certain vape and CBD shops that are located in Wisconsin and Illinois, for a nominal price.

As of March 24, 2022, Lifted has approximately 125 full time and part time employees and independent contractors who are engaged in product formulation, design and branding, website development, private label client management, sales, strategy, distribution, supply chain management, new business development, warehouse management and order fulfillment, operations management, accounting, new product development, trade shows and evaluation of potential acquisitions and joint ventures. Most of Lifted’s employees and independent contractors are based in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the rest are located in Florida, Louisiana and California. 

Joint Ventures

SmplyLifted LLC

Prior to February 9, 2022, Lifted Made had a 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC (“SmplyLifted”), which sells tobacco-free nicotine pouches under the brand name FR3SH (www.GETFR3SH.com). 

As background: on October 16, 2020, Lifted Made had entered into a joint venture called SmplyLifted. Lifted owns 50% of SmplyLifted. The other 50% of SmplyLifted is owned by SMPLSTC LLC and its principals, who are located in Costa Mesa, California. 

On February 9, 2022, Lifted Made sold its 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC to Corner Vapory LLC, an affiliate of Nicholas S. Warrender, CEO of Lifted. Lifted has the option to re-purchase the 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC from Corner Vapory LLC for $1,000 in cash at any time on or before December 31, 2032. For more information, please refer to NOTE 15 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

SmplyLifted conducts its business at Lifted’s and SMPLSTC LLC’s offices, currently without any rent or other charges being payable by SmplyLifted. Prior to the sale of Lifted Made’s 50% interest in SmplyLifted to Corner Vapory LLC, on a quarterly basis, SmplyLifted LLC reimbursed Lifted for WJacobs’ time as the Chief Financial Officer at WJacobs’ hourly rate. Under US GAAP, the Company uses the equity method to account for its 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its share (50%) of SmplyLifted’s earnings (or losses) as income (or losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recorded its initial investment in SmplyLifted, which was $200,000, as an asset at historical cost. Under the equity method, the investment’s value is periodically adjusted to reflect the changes in value due to Lifted’s share in SmplyLifted’s income or losses. At December 31, 2021, Lifted Made wrote off its remaining investment in SmplyLifted, its receivables from SmplyLifted, and its loans to SmplyLifted.

LftdXSvg LLC

On April 22, 2021, Lifted Made and privately-held Savage Enterprises, Irvine, California, partnered to create an equally-owned new entity called LftdXSvg LLC to make and sell products containing hemp-derived THCV (tetrahydrocannabivarin). LftdXSvg LLC was never funded and the managers of LftdXSvg LLC unanimously decided to dissolve LftdXSvg LLC on June 23, 2021. However, both entities are making and selling products containing hemp-derived THCV under a collaborative brand called “Urb Extrax”. The name Urb Extrax is a combination of Lifted’s Urb Finest Flowers brand, and Savage Enterprises’ Delta Extrax brand.

Sources of Supply

Lifted sources its raw goods from many different suppliers. Lifted’s hemp and hemp-derived raw goods are third-party lab tested, and Lifted’s finished goods are also third also third-party lab tested. Lifted does not grow its own hemp or extract cannabinoids from the raw goods. However, many of Lifted’s finished goods are made in house using the raw goods purchased from third party vendors. Some finished goods are purchased from third party vendors, which make products for Lifted in accordance with Lifted’s specifications. Lifted designs the majority of its packaging in-house, and hires third party firms to produce it. In the past, Lifted also sourced gel and liquid sanitizer from various third parties.

Lifted currently believes that it would be able to find replacement manufacturers with minimal negative impact on its business. However, Lifted’s vape pens and cartridges are sourced exclusively from China. COVID-19, Chinese holidays, backups at U.S. ports, and tariffs imposed on products sourced from China could make it difficult or impossible to source these products cost effectively, or at all, from China. COVID-19, Chinese holidays, backups at U.S. ports, and/or tariffs could make it difficult or impossible for Lifted to manufacture needed quantities of its products, if at all, and could drastically increase Lifted’s product costs, all of which could have a serious detrimental impact on Lifted’s sales and profit margins. 

SmplyLifted sources its inventory, packaging and marketing materials from independent suppliers.

Product Risks

Some of Lifted’s and SmplyLifted’s products currently contain hemp-derived delta-8-THC, delta-9-THC, delta-10-THC, HHC, THCO, THCV, CBD and other cannabinoids, and synthetic nicotine. There is a risk that Lifted could be targeted by regulators or consumers with claims that its products are illegal and/or unsafe.

The market for cannabinoid-infused vapes and cartridges is currently subjected to prohibitions of certain products in certain jurisdictions in response to deaths and illnesses that have occurred and that are apparently associated with vaping. In addition, certain jurisdictions have prohibited the sale of smokable hemp and hemp-derived products, including delta-8-THC. These various prohibitions and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.

Intellectual Property

Lifted maintains proprietary formulations, other trade secrets, and a custom mold for its disposable vape. However, Lifted owns no registered patents and has no patent applications pending.
Trademarks

Lifted has filed a trademark application for its “Off-Spectrum” line of products. Lifted is in the process of applying for other trademarks, as well.

R&D expenditures

Lifted’s research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products. Lifted spent less than $10,000 on research and development efforts over the past three years. Research and development costs are expensed as they are incurred. 
Marketing 

Lifted markets itself by networking throughout the industry through word of mouth, its website, and by attending trade shows. In the past, Lifted has also engaged a public relations and search engine optimization firm to improve its public relations and search engine optimization efforts. There can be no guarantee or assurance that Lifted’s marketing efforts will be successful or result in any additional sales or profits for Lifted.

SmplyLifted markets itself by networking throughout the industry through word of mouth, its website and by attending trade shows.

Distribution

Lifted’s distribution is done internally and through third party distributors who distribute throughout the U.S. Lifted and these distributors distribute Lifted’s products to vape and smoke shops, convenience stores, grocery stores, gyms, natural food stores, wellness stores, and other locations. Lifted believes but cannot guarantee that in the event that Lifted lost its relationship with one or more of its current distributors, that other replacement distributors could be found without significant disruption to Lifted’s business. However, the COVID-19 pandemic seriously disrupted Lifted’s distribution channels, although such disruption has generally decreased since the third quarter of 2020.

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws

To Lifted’s knowledge, Lifted does not currently use or generate any hazardous materials in its operations.

OLCC Review of New Directors of the Company

Due to our minority ownership interest in Bendistillery and Bend Spirits, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (“OLCC”) has jurisdiction over our directors, officers and significant shareholders. If the OLCC were to refuse to approve any of our directors, officers or significant shareholders, it could disrupt our management and corporate governance, which could materially adversely affect our Company and the trading price of our common stock.

Description of Certain Key Provisions of the Transaction Documents Relating to the Lifted Merger Agreement

Registration Rights Agreement

In connection with the Merger, the Company signed a Registration Rights Agreement granting NWarrender, or his assigns, “piggyback” and “demand” registration rights in regard to any and all Company registration statements filed with the SEC on or prior to a termination date set out in the agreement, in order to permit the registration of all 3,900,455 shares of Common Stock issued to NWarrender as Stock Consideration in the Merger (“Registrable Shares”). The Registration Rights Agreement can be summarized as follows:

Subject to certain limitations, NWarrender, or his assigns, may demand registration of all or any portion of the Registrable Shares at any time beginning on the 120th day following the closing of the Merger Agreement. The Company must then file a registration statement within ten days. The Company may postpone for up to 180 days the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement for a demand registration if the board of directors determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that such demand registration would (i) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, corporate organization, financing, securities offering or other similar transaction involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act. The Company may delay a demand registration hereunder only once in any period of 12 consecutive months.

No demand registration shall be required where in the judgment of the Company, its legal counsel, and/or SEC guidance and comments the registration would be deemed a primary offering pursuant to Securities Act Rule 415, which is interpreted by the SEC staff to prohibit registrations of stock for resale where the seller is deemed to be engaged in a primary offering of behalf of the issuer. The registration rights agreement shall terminate when no Registrable Shares remain outstanding.

The $3.75M Promissory Note

At the closing of the Merger, the Company executed a secured promissory note of $3,750,000 payable to NWarrender (the “$3.75M Promissory Note”) which can be summarized as follows:

Interest on the $3.75M Promissory Note shall be 2% per year. The maturity date of the $3.75M Promissory Note is the earlier of (a) the date which is 30 days after the last day of the calendar quarter during which Lifted’s aggregate EBITDA (aggregate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ) since the Closing Date of the Merger exceeds $7.5 million, or (b) the date which is the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger.

The $3.75M Promissory Note shall have mandatory prepayments, subject to certain limitations, within five business days following the closing of any equity or debt capital raise by the Company or Lifted following the date of the Merger Agreement wherein NWarrender is entitled to be paid at least 50% of the net proceeds of such capital raise toward a prepayment of the principal and accrued interest on the Promissory Note, excluding only the capital raise for the potential Wisconsin Acquisitions referred to in Section 5.23(a) of the Merger Agreement. See “Obligation to Pursue Two Opportunities” below. Lifted did not use any of the loan or grant money that Lifted has received from the SBA to make any payments on the Promissory Note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to NWarrender. 

The $3.75M Promissory Note is secured by (a) a first lien security interest in all of the assets of the Company and Lifted; and (b) a pledge of: (i) all of the capital stock of Lifted; (ii) all of the common stock of Bendistillery, Bend Spirits and Ablis that is owned by the Company; and (iii) all of the capital stock of any other entity owned by the Company, Lifted or any of their subsidiaries, pursuant to a Collateral Stock Pledge Agreement between NWarrender, as Secured Party, and the Company and Lifted, as Pledgors.

Repayment of $3.75M Promissory Note dated February 24, 2020 Payable by the Company to NWarrender

On December 30, 2021, the Company repaid all principal and interest due under the $3.75M Promissory Note dated February 24, 2020 payable by the Company to NWarrender that was a portion of the Merger Consideration paid by the Company to NWarrender under the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the $3.75M Promissory Note, the unpaid balance of the note accrued interest at the rate of 2% per annum.

NWarrender kept $1,000,000 of the repayment of the $3.75M Promissory Note, plus accrued interest, and on January 3, 2022, reloaned $2,750,000 back to the Company at the rate of 2.5%. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for more information.

Stockholders Agreement

At the closing of the Merger Agreement, our Vice Chairman and COO NWarrender, our Chairman and CEO GJacobs, and our President and CFO WJacobs entered into a Stockholders Agreement which can be summarized as follows: each of them will vote all shares of our common stock now or hereafter owned or controlled by him as unanimously agreed upon by all three of them, including as to the following matters: election, removal and filling vacancies on our board of directors; our charter and bylaws; employment agreements, consulting agreements, fee agreements, base salaries, bonuses, management bonus pools amounts and calculations, management bonus pool allocations and payments, future stock options or warrants issuances, and any other direct or indirect compensation or benefits of any nature whatsoever; acquisitions; divestitures; and capital raises.
Executive Employment Agreements

At the closing of the Merger, the Company entered into employment agreements with NWarrender to serve as Co-Founder, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and as Chief Executive Officer of Lifted, with GJacobs, J.D., to serve as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company, and with WJacobs, CPA to serve as President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company (collectively the “Executive Employment Agreements”), which can be summarized as follows:

Each of the Executive Employment Agreements is a “rolling” five year employment agreement wherein the executive’s employment is effective and shall continue until the fifth anniversary of the commencement of such Executive Employment Agreement, unless terminated. Each of the Executive Employment Agreements shall be deemed to be automatically extended, upon the same terms and conditions, for additional periods of one year (extending the term of such Executive Employment Agreement to five years after each such extension date), unless either party provides written notice of such party’s intention not to extend the term of such Executive Employment Agreement at least 90 days’ prior to the applicable extension date.

During the employment term, each executive shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention to the performance of his duties under his Executive Employment Agreement and shall not engage in any other business, profession or occupation for compensation or otherwise which would conflict or interfere with the performance of such services either directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company; provided, that such executive shall be permitted to continue to participate as an officer of any corporation that owns real estate as of the date of his Executive Employment Agreement with the Company and that is owned by a family trust of which such executive is a grantor or beneficiary, and provided further that such executive, with the prior written consent of the board of directors of the Company shall be permitted to act as a director, trustee, committee member or principal of any type of business, civic or charitable organization and to purchase or own less than 5% of the publicly traded securities of any corporation provided, however, that such ownership represents a passive investment and that such executive is not a controlling person of, or a member of a group that controls, such corporation, and that such activities do not interfere with the performance of such executive’s duties and responsibilities to the Company.

As described above, pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement, commencing January 1, 2022, the Base Salary under each of the Executive Employment Agreements to be paid to Gerard M. Jacobs, William C. Jacobs and Nicholas S. Warrender is $250,000 per year. Prior to entering into the Omnibus Agreement, the annual rate of each executive’s base salary under his Executive Employment Agreement was $100,000.

Each executive shall participate in the Company’s annual company-wide management bonus pool, which can be generally described as a cash set-aside for management bonuses of an amount equal to 33% of the amount (if any) by which the Company’s actual annual consolidated EBITDA exceeds an annual consolidated EBITDA target amount that is mutually agreed upon between the Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the board of directors, on the one hand, and NWarrender, GJacobs and WJacobs, on the other hand, with the allocation of such management bonus pool to be determined by unanimous written agreement of such three executives.

Please read the below section “Allocation and Payment of Bonus Pool” for more information about the company-wide Bonus Pools for 2021 and 2022.

The Company provides to each executive an employee benefits package including fully paid Blue Cross/Blue Shield or equivalent family health, vision and dental insurance. The Company also provides to each executive prompt reimbursement for all documented business-related expenses paid or incurred by such executive in connection with the Company, including but not limited to airfare, rail, taxi, rental cars, parking, tolls, gasoline for business trips, meals, entertainment, hotel, office supplies, mobile phone, internet, hotspot, and postage expenses.

Each executive’s employment may be terminated by either the Company or such executive at any time and for any reason, provided that any termination of such executive’s employment by the Company without cause will trigger significant payment obligations by the Company to such executive. 

Impact of the Merger on GJacobs’ and WJacobs’ Compensation Agreement

The Company entered into a Compensation Agreement dated as of June 19, 2019, with our CEO GJacobs and our President and CFO WJacobs. The material terms of the Compensation Agreement, as amended on December 1, 2020, but prior to the Omnibus Agreement and the Amended Omnibus Agreement described below, can be summarized as follows:

(1) Starting during June 2019 until the closing of the Lifted Merger on February 24, 2020, we paid GJacobs and WJacobs consulting fees of $7,500 and $5,000 per month, respectively. Upon the closing of the Lifted Merger, we entered into Executive Employment Agreements with GJacobs and WJacobs as described in the section above entitled “Executive Employment Agreements”;

(2) The closing of the Lifted Merger triggered obligations of the Company to pay cash bonuses to the Company’s CEO GJacobs and to the Company’s President and CFO WJacobs of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, of which as of December 31, 2021 only $50,000 had been paid to GJacobs, and which accrued 2% annual interest on and after January 1, 2021, and of which $8,439 of the bonuses due and payable by the Company to GJacobs were allocated and applied to pay for the aggregate cost of GJacobs’ purchasing and exercising certain warrants on August 30, 2021 (see section below titled “Exercise of Warrants by Gerard M. Jacobs”);

(3) Upon demand by GJacobs and WJacobs on or after January 1, 2021, or the first date when we have raised a total of at least $15 million after January 1, 2019, we were obligated to pay GJacobs and WJacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, plus 2% annual interest accruing on and after January 1, 2021;

(4) Upon the earlier of December 1, 2021, or the first date when we have raised a total of at least $25 million after January 1, 2019, we were obligated to pay GJacobs and WJacobs cash bonuses of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively;

(5) The terms of GJacobs’ stock options granted by us to purchase shares of common stock of the Company which were set to expire (unless previously exercised) during November 2020 or during September 2021, respectively, have been extended so that all of such stock options may be exercised by GJacobs at any time on or before December 31, 2024;

(6) We granted to GJacobs and to WJacobs so-called “tag along” registration rights for all of our shares owned by GJacobs, by WJacobs, or by any of their respective affiliates, and for all of our shares issuable to GJacobs, to WJacobs, or to any of their respective affiliates upon the exercise of his or their options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company; and

(7) We issued to GJacobs and WJacobs five-year warrants containing a “cashless exercise” feature giving GJacobs and WJacobs (or his designee(s)) the right to purchase 250,000 and 225,000 shares, respectively, of common stock of the Company exercisable at $5.00 per share.

Obligation to Pursue Two Acquisitions in Wisconsin

The Merger Agreement imposes a legally binding obligation upon us to use good faith efforts to acquire two companies located in Wisconsin. These two companies are completely unrelated to, and are not affiliated in any way with, NWarrender. Since the Merger Agreement was entered into, we and NWarrender have mutually agreed to abandon all efforts to acquire the two companies located in Wisconsin, and no further time, efforts, or expense are being incurred in relation to these two companies located in Wisconsin.
Obligation to Pursue a Hemp Processing System Deal

The Merger Agreement imposes a legally binding obligation upon us to use good faith efforts to pursue an opportunity in the cannabinoid industry. Warrender’s father, Board member Robert T. Warrender II, has introduced us to a potential business opportunity to process CBD from hemp using a system that is currently undergoing proof of concept operational testing and that incorporates particular filtration and pump equipment and technology identified by Robert T. Warrender II. Robert T. Warrender II believes that this advanced hemp processing system has the potential to allow significantly higher throughput, and lower per unit costs of production. We have agreed to analyze the results of the proof of concept’s construction, operating costs, and operating results. If such analysis is favorable and is approved by our Board in its discretion, then we will use good faith efforts to attempt to proceed forward, in a joint venture or other arrangement involving Robert T. Warrender II, with a project(s) consisting of one or more of such hemp processing systems, subject to various conditions including a capital raise associated therewith, and any equity compensation received by Robert T. Warrender II from the financing, construction, operation, leasing and/or sale of such project(s) shall be structured in the form of shares of common stock of the Company valued at the then-current trading price per share of common stock of the Company but in no event at higher than $5.00 per share of common stock of the Company.

9


Since the Company’s acquisition of Lifted in February 2020, there have been no material discussions among the Company, Lifted and Robert T. Warrender II regarding the development or financing of any hemp processing system and to date no such project has proceeded forward. If the project proceeds, and there is no assurance that it will proceed, a company owned by Robert T. Warrender II could potentially supply certain pumps and other equipment for that project.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Currently, the Company’s only wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifted, is generating enough free cash flow to allow the Company and Lifted to fund their operations at their current levels and to grow Lifted’s business in a conservative, capital-constrained fashion. However, no guarantee or assurance can be given that Lifted’s current level of free cash flow will continue in the future, especially in light of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and executive orders that are associated with the pandemic or that otherwise negatively impact the sales of hemp-derived products and nicotine products.

The Company and Lifted have aspirations to grow significantly faster than at their current levels, both organically and via acquisitions. But, to do so likely would require the Company to raise many millions of dollars of additional capital. 

The $2,750,000 Promissory Note payable jointly by the Company and Lifted to NWarrender is secured by a perfected first lien security interest (the “Security Interest”) that encumbers all of the assets of the Company and Lifted. 

The existence of the $2,750,000 Promissory Note and the Security Interest make it extremely difficult for the Company and Lifted to raise capital via borrowing, since few if any potential lenders are interested in making loans to the Company and/or to Lifted that would be unsecured or that would be secured by a second lien that is subordinate to the $2,750,000 Promissory Note and the Security Interest, except perhaps on terms that would be extremely expensive or otherwise unattractive to the Company.

And currently, management of the Company is reluctant to raise capital by selling equity securities of the Company (common stock and/or convertible preferred stock) at the current trading price per share of the Company’s common stock or any lower price per share.

Even if the Company is able to raise additional capital via borrowing or the sale of equity securities of the Company: (1) the Company will be obligated to prepay all remaining principal and all accrued interest on the $2,750,000 Promissory Note to NWarrender within two business days following the closing of any debt or equity capital raise by Payors following the date of the $2,750,000 Promissory Note in the amount of $8,000,000 or more; (2) the Company will be obligated to pay an aggregate of $500,000 in bonuses to GJacobs, WJacobs and NWarrender on or before December 31, 2022, provided that GJacobs, WJacobs and NWarrender have not resigned on or before December 31, 2021; (3) Lifted will be obligated to purchase the building leased by Lifted from Holdings,  an affiliate of NWarrender, on or before December 31, 2022, for a fixed purchase price equal to $1,375,000; and (4) the Company is accruing 3% annual dividends on its Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Additional capital raised by the Company that is used to pay down the $2,750,000 Promissory Note, or that is used to pay the aforedescribed bonuses, or that is used to buy the building leased by Lifted from Holdings, or that is used to pay dividends on our outstanding Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, is collectively referred to as the “Allocated Capital”.

If, notwithstanding these impediments, the Company and/or Lifted is able to raise debt or equity capital that is in addition to the Allocated Capital (the “Growth Capital”), then the Growth Capital would likely be used first to assist Lifted’s organic growth. 

Any additional Growth Capital available would likely be used in connection with potential acquisitions. While the Company would prefer to engage in 100% stock-for-stock acquisitions, potential acquisition candidates frequently prefer that a significant portion of the acquisition consideration be in cash. Also, the process of conducting a due diligence investigation and audit of potential acquisition candidates can be very expensive and requires cash. Also, some potential acquisitions may only make sense if the Company is in a position to inject cash into the potential acquisition candidates simultaneously with the closing of the acquisitions, in order to pay off accrued liabilities or to provide needed growth capital.

There is no assurance that the Company and Lifted will be able to obtain the additional Growth Capital needed to accelerate our growth beyond current levels. Our ability to obtain Growth Capital will depend on the level of pandemic-related stress on Lifted’s distributors and customers, governmental prohibitions and regulations of hemp-derived cannabinoids such as delta-8-THC, delta-9-THC, delta-10-THC, investor demand, our performance and reputation, the price of the Company’s common stock, and other factors beyond our control. 

Our inability to raise additional Growth Capital could result in the delay or indefinite postponement of our growth objectives.

There can be no assurance or guarantee that any additional Growth Capital will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all. The lack of availability of additional Growth Capital could have a material adverse effect on our Company and the trading price of our common stock.

The Market

Delta-8-THC, delta-9-THC, delta-10-THC, HHC, THCO, THCV, CBD, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids can be derived from hemp. On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, which is more commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”. The 2018 Farm Bill legalizes hemp cultivation and declassifies hemp as a Schedule I controlled substance. The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under federal law, the FDA continues to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. In addition, several states have enacted laws and regulations that negatively impact the sale of hemp and hemp-derived products, especially hemp-derived products containing delta-8-THC.

Lifted’s product sales of hemp-derived products are typically made through distributors, with a limited but growing number of sales online or direct to retail outlets. 

While Lifted is optimistic regarding the future of its business selling hemp-derived products, the manufacture and sale of Canna-Infused Products involve significant risks that have the potential to bankrupt Lifted and the Company.

Government Laws and Regulations

Lifted primarily sells hemp-derived products, including products containing delta-8-THC, delta-9-THC, delta-10-THC, HHC, THCO, THCV, CBD, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids, and products that contain nicotine. Lifted’s sales are typically made through distributors, with a limited but growing number of sales online or direct to retail outlets. Lifted is attempting to only conduct business related to manufacturing and commercializing hemp-derived products to the extent permitted in jurisdictions where it may operate.

While Lifted is optimistic regarding the future of its business selling hemp-derived products and products that contain nicotine, the manufacture and sale of hemp-derived products and products that contain nicotine involves significant risks associated with federal, state and local laws and regulations, and regulatory agencies, that have the potential to bankrupt Lifted and the Company, or at least to negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.

In regard to the sale of hemp-derived products in the United States, despite cannabis having been legalized at the state level for medical use in many states and for adult recreational use in a number of states, cannabis, other than plants of the same genus that meet the definition of industrial hemp, continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and subject to the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (“CSIEA”). As of December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill, formally known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “Farm Bill”), has reclassified hemp for commercial use by removing it from its Schedule I Status under the CSA, and Lifted seeks to operate in compliance with the legislation. However:

(a) FDA: The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under the Farm Bill, the FDA continues to regulate cannabis products under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The health and safety impacts of delta-8-THC, delta-10-THC, CBD, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids have not yet been established via traditional scientific and/or clinical studies. The FDA appears to believe that CBD, delta-8-THC and other hemp-derived cannabinoids may or could have significant adverse health impacts upon human beings, especially in regard to potential liver toxicity or liver damage. Furthermore, the FDA sometimes appears to believe that certain cannabinoids are drugs, and that the sale of certain cannabinoid-infused products without FDA approval is illegal. In deference to the FDA’s position, various states and municipalities have similarly declared that the sale of certain hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products such as delta-8-THC is illegal, or have imposed restrictions or prohibitions upon the sale of certain hemp-derived products. The FDA may in the future impose significant licensing or other requirements, regulations, restrictions and/or prohibitions on the sale of hemp-derived products, which could have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock;

(b) DEA: The US Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) has stated that although hemp is no longer an illegal substance under the Farm Bill, the FDA continues to pursue Schedule I controlled substances as well as certain synthetic substances. In particular: 

(i) Hemp and hemp-derived cannabinoid-infused products which exceed a delta-9-THC concentration of 0.3% are illegal under the Farm Bill. Any failure to keep the delta-9-THC concentration in Lifted’s hemp-derived or cannabinoid-infused products below 0.3% could subject us to action by the DEA or other regulatory authorities and/or to lawsuits by consumers, which could have a material adverse effect upon our Company’s business and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, certain hemp-derived products may, over time, gradually increase their delta-9-THC concentration, and this may ultimately cause such products to exceed the 0.3% delta-9-THC concentration level, making such products illegal in certain jurisdictions. If this happens, we could be subject to regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect upon our Company and the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the approval of medical and recreational marijuana by many states has created a situation in which it may be difficult or impossible for regulators and courts to determine whether the THC levels reflected in consumers’ blood tests are the result of legal hemp-derived products or marijuana-infused products. This may result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against the Company; and 

(ii) The DEA has issued a statement that some have interpreted as making hemp-derived delta-8-THC illegal. In deference to the DEA, certain state and local governments have imposed restrictions or prohibitions upon the sale of certain products containing delta-8-THC. Lifted sells significant quantities of products containing hemp-derived delta-8-THC, and any crackdown by the DEA or other regulatory authorities on products containing delta-8-THC could have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock; and


11


(c) Amended PACT act: The recently amended federal PACT act makes the online sale of certain of Lifted’s products to end users difficult or impossible. The amended federal PACT act could have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

In regard to the sale of products containing nicotine, products containing nicotine are addictive and are subject to heavy regulation by U.S. federal, state and local governments. The legislative and regulatory landscape surrounding nicotine-containing products has created risks for Lifted’s business. Laws and regulations have been adopted that can impose significant liabilities upon companies operating in the nicotine industry, especially in regard to sales to minors. Existing and future laws and regulations affecting nicotine products could have a material adverse effect upon Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

Furthermore, the regulation of nicotine, hemp, hemp-derived cannabinoids, and cannabinoid-infused products is evolving. Lifted may become subject to new laws, rules, regulations, moratoriums, prohibitions, or other restrictions or impediments upon nicotine and Canna-Infused Products Companies imposed by the U.S. President pursuant to executive orders, by the U.S. Congress in laws, by U.S. federal agencies such as the FDA and/or the DEA, and/or by state and local governments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, governmental laws, rules and regulations may impose significant new rules, restrictions, limitations, prohibitions and/or taxes on when, where, how and to whom Lifted may sell its products, and these new rules, restrictions, limitations, prohibitions and/or taxes could have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s business and the trading price of our common stock.

Competition

Lifted faces intense competition in the cannabinoid industry and in the nicotine products industry from both existing and emerging companies that offer similar products to Lifted. Some of Lifted’s current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories, more innovative or popular products, greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases. Given the rapid changes affecting the cannabinoid industry nationally and locally, Lifted may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to keep pace with any changes in local and national markets, especially in light of legal and regulatory changes. Competition is also based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences, as well as convenience and service. Lifted’s success will depend on its ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions and competitive pressures. Any failure to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on Lifted’s financial condition, operating results, liquidity, cash flow and operational performance.
Receipt of Loans under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program and the Paycheck Protection Program

In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) made small business owners eligible to apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan advance of up to $10,000 under its Economic Injury Disaster Loan program (the “EIDL”). This advance provided economic relief to businesses experiencing a temporary loss of revenue due to the pandemic. This loan advance will not have to be repaid. Lifted applied for and received a $10,000 loan advance under the EIDL (“EIDL Advance”) on April 20, 2020. Lifted recognized a $10,000 gain on the forgiveness of the EIDL Advance on April 21, 2020. 

Lifted also applied for and received a loan (the “PPP Loan”) under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted March 27, 2020. The PPP Loan was issued by BMO Harris Bank (the “Lender”) in the aggregate principal amount of $149,622.50 and evidenced by a promissory note (the “Note”), dated April 14, 2020 issued by Lifted to the Lender. The Note matures on April 14, 2022. The Note bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per annum, payable monthly commencing on November 14, 2020, following an initial deferral period as specified under the PPP. As of December 31, 2020, Lifted had an accrual of $1,074 for the interest on the PPP Loan. The Note may be prepaid by Lifted at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. Proceeds from the PPP Loan will be available to Lifted to fund designated expenses, including certain payroll costs and other permitted expenses, in accordance with the PPP. Under the terms of the PPP, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest of the PPP Loan may be forgiven to the extent that at least 75% of the PPP Loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the SBA under the PPP. The Company believes that Lifted has used at least 75% of the PPP Loan amount for designated qualifying expenses and Lifted applied for forgiveness of the PPP Loan in accordance with the terms of the PPP. On April 20, 2021, the entire PPP Loan ($149,622) and the interest payable on the PPP Loan ($1,525) was forgiven by the SBA.

Acquisition Process

The structure of the Company’s participation in business opportunities and ventures will continue to be situational.


12


The Company is likely to structure future acquisitions as a purchase of 19.99% or less, or 100%, of a target company’s equity ownership interest, or as a so-called tax-free reorganization. However, in particular situations, the Company is willing to consider alternative deal structures including joint ventures. For example, during 2020, Lifted entered into a 50-50 joint venture called SmplyLifted LLC, with the other 50% of SmplyLifted LLC being owned by SMPLSTC LLC and its principals; Lifted has sold its 50% interest in SmplyLifted LLC. And during 2021, the Company’s Lifted Made subsidiary entered into a 50-50 joint venture called LftdXSvg LLC, with the other 50% of LftdXSvg LLC being owned by Savage Enterprises; LftdXSvg LLC was dissolved prior to conducting any business.

In deals that are structured as tax-free reorganizations, it is expected that the Company will issue a relatively large number of newly issued shares of the Company, and, as a result, substantial additional dilution to the percentage ownership of our current stockholders.

The Company’s present management and shareholders may not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or purchase of stock. It is possible that the shareholders of the acquired entity or the persons who provide the capital to the Company to finance a merger or purchase of stock will gain control of the Company’s voting stock and the Company’s directors may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by the shareholders. Those directors are entitled to replace the Company’s officers without stockholder vote.

Closing such purchases of stock or so-called tax-free reorganizations will likely require the Company to raise millions of dollars of capital, in order to pay the cash portion of the transaction consideration. The Company can provide no assurance or guaranty whatsoever that it will be able to raise such millions of dollars of capital on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all.

An Investment Committee appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors, currently consisting of our CEO GJacobs, JD, our Chief Operating Officer NWarrender, and our President and CFO WJacobs, CPA, will review material furnished to it and will vote whether or not the Investment Committee believes a potential acquisition is in the Company’s best interests and the interests of the Company’s shareholders. If the Investment Committee votes unanimously to approve a potential acquisition, then such acquisition will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Company for their review and a vote. The Company does not intend to proceed forward with a potential acquisition without the unanimous approval of the Investment Committee and approval by a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors.

The Company intends to source acquisition opportunities through GJacobs, NWarrender, WJacobs, and directors and their contacts, and in some cases through finders. These contacts include professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker dealers, other members of the financial community, other businesses and others who may present solicited and unsolicited proposals. Management believes that business opportunities may become available to us due to a number of factors, including, among others: (1) the Company’s ownership of shares in Lifted and other Canna-Infused Products Companies; (2) management’s historical experience building large public companies; (3) management’s contacts and acquaintances; and (4) the Company’s flexibility with respect to the manner in which the Company may be able to structure, finance, merge with or acquire any business opportunity.

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Investment Committee appointed by our Board of Directors. Inasmuch as the Company will have limited funds available to search for business opportunities, the Company will not be able to expend significant funds on a complete and exhaustive investigation of such business or opportunity. The Company will, however, investigate, to the extent believed reasonable by the Investment Committee, such potential business opportunities by conducting a so-called “due diligence investigation”.

In a due diligence investigation, the Company intends to obtain and review materials regarding the business opportunity. Typically, such materials will include information regarding a target business’ products, services, contracts, management, ownership, and financial information. In addition, the Company intends to cause the Investment Committee to meet personally with management and key personnel of target businesses, ask questions regarding the target businesses’ prospects, tour facilities, and conduct other reasonable investigation of the target businesses to the extent of the Company’s limited financial resources and management and technical expertise.

There is no guarantee that the Company can obtain or maintain the funding needed for its operations, including the funds necessary to search for and investigate acquisition candidates, and to close an acquisition including paying the substantial costs of legal, accounting and other relevant professional services.

As of March 23, 2022, the consolidated cash on hand of the Company was a total of $4,253,591. To date, Lifted has also invested cash of $587,500 into a company called SmplyLifted LLC, which SmplyLifted LLC has primarily used to purchase inventory of tobacco-free nicotine pouches. Lifted has sold its 50% interest in SmplyLifted LLC, and Lifted does not expect to invest additional cash into SmplyLifted LLC. Lifted has a 50% membership interest in SmplyLifted LLC. At December 31, 2021, Lifted Made wrote off its remaining investment in SmplyLifted, its receivables from SmplyLifted, and its loans to SmplyLifted.

In prior years, the Company’s payables have been greater than its cash on hand. Historically, the Company has had inconsistent income generating ability and is therefore has been reliant on raising money from loans or stock sales.
