Overview
Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. ("Inhibikase" or "the Company") is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for Parkinson’s Disease, or PD, and related disorders that arise inside and outside of the brain. In 2021, we commenced clinical development of IkT-148009, a small molecule Abelson Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor we believe can modify the course of Parkinson’s disease including its manifestation in the gastrointestinal tract, or GI. Results to date of our ongoing Phase 1 Single and Multiple Ascending Dose escalation study (SAD and MAD, respectively) in older and elderly healthy volunteers have revealed important insights into the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of IkT-148009 in human subjects. We enrolled 88 subjects in the Phase 1 study. Results from the Phase 1 study have shown that IkT-148009 has a half-life of greater than 24 hours and just a 25 mg once daily oral dose in older and elderly healthy subjects in our Phase 1 study reached exposures that are consistent with the exposure to the drug that resulted in therapeutic efficacy in animal models of progressive Parkinson’s disease. In July 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, agreed with the Company’s plan to initiate its Phase 1b study in Parkinson’s patients which commenced dosing October 19, 2021, and one cohort of 8 patients have completed the Phase 1b study to date. The Company anticipates initiating Phase 2 studies of IkT-148009 in Parkinson’s disease in the second quarter of 2022, subject to agreements with the FDA. Clinical development of IkT-148009 for the GI complications in PD patients will cross-reference the Phase 1 study of IkT-148009 for the treatment of PD. Our efforts in Parkinson’s disease are being extended into other Parkinson’s-related indications, such as the Orphan Disease Multiple Systems Atrophy, or MSA. Depending on the outcome of animal model studies of MSA, the Company may initiate Phase 2 studies of IkT-148009 in MSA in the third quarter of 2022 following regulatory submissions in the U.S. and European Union, or EU. Clinical development of the Company’s oncology asset, IkT-001Pro, is anticipated to begin shortly after submission of the Company’s Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for IkT-001Pro; submission of the IND is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2022.
 Our advancement of the pre-clinical and clinical development program for MSA was benefited by a grant received from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, or NINDS, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, for $385,888 to fund animal model studies of IkT-148009 as a therapy for MSA. These animal studies are now underway. At the same time, we are preparing regulatory submissions to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and to the FDA to enable a Phase 2a safety and tolerability study in MSA patients in up to 19 sites in the EU, and up to 6 sites in the U.S. involving 60 patients. The proposed clinical Phase 2a study will have primary endpoints in safety and tolerability and exploratory endpoints in MSA efficacy parameters with 3 month daily dosing at two different doses. While we complete the set-up of the Phase 2a study in MSA, we will complete at least one model study to support advancing IkT-148009 into patients in the third-quarter of 2022. Dosing of patients with MSA will depend on a positive outcome in animal model studies; if IkT-148009 is not a successful therapy in MSA model studies, the Phase 2a clinical study will not proceed. In this circumstance, the regulatory effort for IkT-148009 in the EU would be applied to future studies of Parkinson’s Disease efficacy in the EU. The Company plans to pursue orphan drug designation for IkT-148009 to treat Multiple System Atrophy with regulators in the U.S. and Europe.
 We have also advanced clinical batch manufacturing and pill formulation for our platform prodrug technology involving IkT-001Pro. Clinical batch manufacturing was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an IND is planned to be filed in the second quarter of 2022, to include the production of the data package for the final pill formulation.
 In the ensuing 12 months, the Company anticipates reporting the full outcomes of its completed Phase 1 study of IkT-148009 in older and elderly healthy subjects, reporting the outcomes of the completed chronic toxicology studies in rats and monkeys for IkT-148009 to enable chronic drug administration in Parkinson’s patients, completing a Phase 1b extension study of IkT-148009 in Parkinson’s patients and initiating its Phase 2a efficacy study in Parkinson’s patients. Advancement of the Company’s Phase 2a program in PD with IkT-148009 is subject to review and agreements with the FDA. We further anticipate initiating the Phase 2a clinical study in MSA in the U.S. and EU, subject to a successful model study outcome and agreements with regulatory agencies in the U.S. and EU. Finally, we intend to advance IkT-001Pro through IND filing and initiate clinical development, possibly completing clinical development in 2022.
 Our programs utilize small molecule, oral protein kinase inhibitors to treat Parkinson’s Disease, or PD, and its GI complications. We have shown in animal models of progressive PD that our lead clinical candidate, IkT-148009, is a brain penetrant Abelson tyrosine kinase, or c-Abl inhibitor, that halts disease progression and reverses functional loss in the brain and reverses neurological dysfunction in the GI tract. We have not yet observed reversal of functional loss in humans. The ability to halt progression and restore function was shown in animal models of progressive disease that mimic the rate of disease progression and the extent of functional loss in the brain and/or the GI tract as found in patients with PD. We believe our therapeutic approach is disease-modifying. Our understanding of how and why PD progresses has led us to believe that functional loss in Parkinson’s patients may be at least partially reversed. Based on the measurements in animal models, we believe patients treated with IkT-148009 may have their disease progression slowed or halted, we may see a progressive reduction in the need for symptomatic or supportive therapy and/or we may ultimately eliminate

the need for symptomatic therapy. However, as of the date of this Report, it is unknown whether the disease modification seen in the animal models will occur in patients following treatment with IkT-148009.
In our opinion, the multi-decade failures in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD result from a lack of understanding of the biochemistry of the disease processes involved. Neurodegeneration is marked by a progressive degeneration and loss of function of neurons which send and receive signals from and to the brain. Historically, the cause of a neurodegenerative disease was thought to be a “plaque” made up of a misfolded and/or aggregated protein(s). Therapeutic approaches, therefore, sought to remove “plaque” from the brain. To our knowledge, a “plaque”-focused treatment strategy has not resulted in approval of any medication that can alter the course of a neurodegenerative disease, and has not resulted in a therapeutic benefit in PD. We believe we are different. We identified the proteins that become dysfunctional in a disease pathway and sought to understand how a dysfunctional protein causes disease. We believe our approach to PD and other neurological diseases has identified the underlying cause of disease and led to an understanding of how individual proteins are linked together to define the disease process. Using this strategy, we believe we have discovered at least one enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the disease process for PD, c-Abl. We have developed novel protein kinase inhibitors against c-Abl, which we believe can alter the disease course for PD. c-Abl chemically modifies one of the “plaque” proteins in PD, known as alpha-synuclein. Chemical modification creates what we believe to be the true toxic entity of the disease. Treatment with IkT-148009 may prevent chemical modification and, at least in animal models of progressive disease, leads to clearance of the toxic form of alpha-synuclein from some or all tissues affected in the disease.
In addition to programs in PD, our platform drug discovery and delivery technologies have identified additional opportunities, including a potential treatment for bacterial or viral infections in the brain using a single agent at fixed dose, and an oncology opportunity in stable-phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, or CML. Our product for CML, IkT-001Pro, is a prodrug of the anticancer agent Imatinib. A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized by the body into a pharmacologically active drug. Imatinib is an FDA designated orphan drug and is the standard-of-care treatment for stable-phase CML. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. We plan to submit an IND to initiate clinical development for IkT-001Pro in the second quarter of 2022. We intend to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for IkT-001Pro pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which specifies the requirements for approval. This pathway would allow us to rely, in part, on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of an approved compound. Consistent with FDA guidance on the 505(b)(2) pathway, we will seek input from the FDA as to what should be included in the application prior to submission of the 505(b)(2) application. Pursuit of this oncology opportunity will seek to validate the pharmacology advantage of our prodrug technology in a well understood patient population with an approved drug substance. If we are able to validate IkT-001Pro in oncology, we will evaluate whether the pharmacology advantages we discover about IkT-001Pro could be applied to novel drug substances, such as IkT-148009.
We believe we are one of the pioneers of the application of protein kinase inhibitors to non-oncology indications, including neurodegeneration and infectious diseases, as well as their more traditional role in the treatment of cancer. We have been a frequent recipient of private, state and federal grants for its Research and Development activities, to include funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense and the Michael J. Fox Foundation. We believe our ability to advance the Company on the basis of scientific peer review reflects the potential our scientific peers see for the possible success of our therapeutic programs.
To increase the probability of success, we are making parallel investments in several product candidates and back-up candidates, and plan to advance only those candidates to the later stages of clinical development that show strong preclinical and early clinical data. By developing a portfolio of product candidates across therapeutic indications, we can continuously apply learnings and tools across programs and leverage economies of scale in our research and development organization. Our target indications include diseases with large patient populations, such as PD, as well as orphan indications, such as Progressive, Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, Multiple System Atrophy and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia.
We currently have worldwide commercialization rights to all of our development programs and IP protection until 2033 or later.
RAMPTM: Our Reengineering Approach with Metabolism Preserved
Our candidate portfolio relies on our medicinal chemistry design approach which evaluates the human pharmacology of an approved drug and uses the approved drug as a template on which to base a novel drug design. Key to this proprietary process is the reproduction of the metabolism of the template in the new molecule. By preserving the metabolic process and generating metabolites in the new molecule that substantively match the metabolites of the template, we believe the safety profile of the new molecule will be closely related to the template. We believe the safety profile will be closely related because most side effects arise from the chemical structure, the drug’s selectivity for the target and the metabolites of the drug. When the metabolites of the template and the new molecule are chemically similar, there is a likelihood that the safety profile of the new molecule will be similar to or the same as the safety profile of the template. We validated this was the case for IkT-148009, our lead molecule for PD and related disorders, which used Imatinib as a design template. Imatinib is the active ingredient in the anti-cancer drug Gleevec®, whose side effect profile

linearly correlates with oral dose. With metabolite similarity between IkT-148009 and Imatinib, we believe we can take advantage of the linear correlation between side effects and oral dose for Imatinib. IkT-148009 is 18-fold more potent than Imatinib against its therapeutic target, predicting a dose that will be lower than the standard dose of Imatinib (400 mg) and, therefore, predicting a human safety profile that is expected to be no worse than that of Imatinib.
Our Portfolio
IkT-148009: Our product candidate for Parkinson’s Disease and related alpha-synuclein disorders
Market and Commercial Opportunity
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 700,000 to 1,000,000 persons in the United States, with 60,000 new cases and 38,000 deaths annually with an average age of onset of 60 years of age. In addition to the 60,000 new cases each year, thousands of cases go undetected. Almost all patients with Parkinson’s disease will eventually need to take medication to help with their symptoms. Worldwide, there could be as many as 10,000,000 cases of PD. By 2025, PD drug sales are expected to double; sales estimates are expected to exceed $6.0 billion by 2025. The country with the highest diagnosed prevalence of PD is the U.S. PD tends to be a disease of men, with a nearly 2:1 ratio of men:women among patients diagnosed with this disease. A particular challenge to the treatment of Parkinson’s patients are their comorbidities, which include arthritis, cardiovascular disease, psychosis and dementia. The future market for treatment is robust, with the compound annual growth rates for patients with PD that are diagnosed and not diagnosed is 2.7% and 1.8%, respectively, and we expect those growth rates to continue through the foreseeable future. In the U.S. market, patients currently expend $15,000 to $25,000 per year to treat the symptoms of PD, creating a multibillion-dollar opportunity for disease-modification of this devastating disease. Moreover, since the same product would be used to treat both PD and its GI complications, we believe we have multiple opportunities to achieve commercial success in several treatment areas in this market.
c-Abl inhibition as a treatment focus in PD and related diseases
PD is a progressive disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, difficulty in walking and an inability to maintain one’s posture or keep oneself from falling. Pathologically, PD is characterized by degeneration of neurons in an area of the brain near the brainstem, coupled with the aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins in cell bodies known as Lewy bodies (LBs). The clinical and pathologic features of PD affect other areas of the brain in addition to the brainstem, resulting in a widespread pathology that is not adequately controlled with dopamine-replacement (i.e. levodopa) therapy. Manifestations of PD include falling, freezing, neuropsychiatric disorders, GI complications, sensory problems, and cognitive impairment with dementia. PD is initiated by a dysfunctional protein known as alpha-synuclein. In its dysfunctional form, alpha-synuclein is aggregated and likely to be misfolded, which alters its physiological properties in the body. Dysfunctional alpha-synuclein, when taken up by a neuron, starts a cascade of events that are illustrated in Fig. 1.
We believe that we can succeed in developing therapies that will slow or stop PD and related disorders because we and our collaborators have characterized the pathways in Fig. 1. We believe the Abelson tyrosine kinase, or c-Abl, acts as a checkpoint or gateway to the pathway driving neurodegeneration. The steps on the pathway illustrated in Fig. 1 have been validated in multiple contexts and multiple organ systems and by reproducing parts of these results in preclinical animal models in three independent laboratories. Drawing from this knowledge, we believe inhibition of c-Abl will block the events downstream of c-Abl in these pathways and modify disease for PD and other alpha-synuclein related disorders.



Figure 1: The Biochemistry of Parkinson’s Disease Initiation and Progression and How to Disrupt It.

A. The process of neurodegeneration. Misfolded α-synuclein can arise from a variety of factors (see text). Misfolded α-synuclein may form within the neuron or by transfer through cell surface receptors or by crossing membrane bilayers. Within a neuron, misfolded α-synuclein is ‘sensed’ and c-Abl activated, driving the formation of pathologic α-synuclein by chemical modification (p-Syn). Chemical modification creates a form of α-synuclein that represents the pathologic species of the disease leading to disruption of mitochondrial integrity, negatively impact the endosome, disrupt nucleosomal structure and modulate transcription of certain genes. C-Abl also inactivates parkin by chemical modification, which affects mitochondrial quality control and suppresses protein clearance mechanisms. Parkin inactivation suppresses the complex interplay between parkin and pink1 at the mitochondrion, which act in concert to maintain mitochondrial integrity, quality and regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Parkin inactivation leads to the accumulation of toxic parkin substrates PARIS (PARkin Interacting Substrate), aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) and far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1). PARIS and AIMP2 accumulate in adult conditional parkin knockout mice and MPTP-intoxicated mice as well as in patients with PD.  Increased levels of PARIS can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction through down-regulation of PGC-1a and loss of DA neurons in a PARIS-dependent manner. Overexpression of AIMP2 leads to an age-dependent, selective degeneration of DA neurons through activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), driving PARP1-mediated parthanatos.  This suggests that PARIS and AIMP2 may be important contributors to the loss of DA neurons and possibly other vulnerable neurons following parkin inactivation.  Inactivation of parkin also disrupts protein clearance mechanisms through autophagy, lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways.

B. The consequences of c-Abl inhibitor treatment on the process of neurodegenerative disease. Inhibition of c-Abl precludes c-Abl activation, blocking the build-up of toxic parkin substrates PARIS and AIMP2 and terminating downstream events. This also re-establishes normal mitochondrial quality control and biogenesis. Model studies demonstrate that modified and unmodified a-synuclein aggregates are shunted to lysosomal or proteasomal degradation pathways for clearance with concomitant recovery of motor function
 








Pipeline
 
IkT-148009 for Neurodegeneration
 IkT-148009, which we have shown in animal models to be selective and brain penetrant, is a small molecule c-Abl inhibitor that we are using in clinical trials to treat two groups of PD patients and two additional groups to evaluate GI complications that arise early in the disease course in PD patients. We delineate the GI complications from PD because we will evaluate the GI complications using unique measurements and endpoints that are distinct from PD itself. Thus, we believe we will have four opportunities to succeed with IkT-148009, lowering the risk of failure during the development program. We believe we have further lowered the risks associated with development of IkT-148009 because we believe key aspects of the underlying pharmacology of IkT-148009 are the same as the pharmacological properties of the template molecule, Imatinib, from which IkT-148009 was chemically derived. IkT-148009 is a true new molecular entity and is subject to the regulatory guidance for new chemical entities from the FDA. The four indications to which IkT-148009 will be applied are listed in the Pipeline. The basis for our belief that IkT-148009 could be effective in treating patients with PD or its GI complications arises from the study of multiple animals with alpha-synuclein-dependent progressive disease, wherein we showed repeated functional recovery, rescued neurons that had not yet degraded and cleared alpha-synuclein-toxicity using a 1x/day oral dose. Therapeutic administration beginning four weeks post induction of disease resulted in nearly complete functional recovery with 4 weeks in the GI tract and 8 weeks within the brain. We believe these animals studies directly reflect on the human disease and the possible benefits patients may realize from IkT-148009.
 Toxicology of IkT-148009 in rat and monkey
13 week toxicology studies in rats and monkeys revealed no meaningful toxicity up to a No Observed Adverse Event Level, or NOAEL, of 50 mg/kg/day in monkey (equivalent to a human dose of 413 mg for a 60 kg adult). The observations of very slight (at 50mg/kg/day) or slight (at 200 mg/kg/day) bile-duct hyperplasia in 14-day studies in rat were not observed in 13-week studies, suggesting that as dosing duration is lengthened, the toxicology profile actually improves for IkT-148009. In monkey, 14-day toxicology studies revealed no meaningful toxicity up to a NOAEL of 31.2 mg/kg/day (equivalent to a human dose of 600 mg for a 60 kg adult), and consistent with the 13 week studies in rat, the NOAEL in monkey increased to 75 mg/kg/day (equivalent to a human does of 1459 mg for a 60 kg adult). Thus, as seen for rat, increased duration of dosing in monkey improved the toxicology profile. At the highest dose of 200 mg/kg/day in 14-day studies in monkey, 5 of 10 females displayed up to 13% prolongation of the cardiovascular QTc interval that was reversible; QTc prolongation was not observed in 13 week studies in monkey. 13 week toxicology studies in rat and monkey were submitted to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2021; 26 week studies in rat and 39 week toxicology studies in monkey are anticipated to be reported to the FDA during the second quarter of 2022.


Clinical Development for IkT-148009
We filed two INDs with the FDA for IkT-148009. One IND focused on clinical endpoints in the brain and a second IND focused on quantitative endpoints in the GI tract using proprietary tests. Clinical development for the GI complications in PD patients will cross-reference the Phase 1 study of IkT-148009 for the treatment of PD.
The following figure details how we plan to execute the clinical programs to be conducted going forward:



We initially planned the Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies in older and elderly healthy volunteers to be performed sequentially, which would have taken 14 months to complete. However, efficiencies realized since our initial public offering allowed us to alter the Phase 1 design and interleave the SAD and MAD cohorts. In the SAD and MAD studies, 72 SAD subjects and 16 MAD subjects were dosed between 12.5 mg and 325 mg. Severe adverse events total were observed and summarized in the table below.
 

Table: Adverse events observed following oral IkT-148009 administration in SAD/MAD 
Dose and Phase | Event | Treatment Related
37.5 mgSAD | Palpitations emerged 2 weeks post-dose, evaluated, subsided during evaluation | Possibly related 
250 mgSAD | Intermittent vaginal bleeding began pre-dose, occurred sporadically for 3 days | Not related 
250 mgSAD | Covid-19 infection | Not related 
325 mgSAD | Mild Diarrhea, single instance | Possibly related 
325 mgSAD | Mild Diarrhea, sporadic instance for 3 days | Possibly related 
25 mgMAD | Common cold | Not related 
25 mgMAD | Bilateral lower leg edema emerged 22 days post-dose, treated, did not reoccur | Possibly related 

 


Following review by the FDA, the Phase 1b program commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and completed the first cohort in the first quarter of 2022. In this cohort, three adverse events were seen: pneumonia, spinal headache following cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, collection and dermatitis that was treated and did not reoccur. In both the Phase 1 and Phase 1b programs, the presence of IkT-148009 was confirmed by measurement of drug concentration in CSF.
 The Phase 2a protocol has been submitted to the FDA during the first quarter of 2022 and we anticipate dosing the first patient in the Phase 2a program in the second quarter of 2022. Based on the outcomes of studies in animal models of progressive disease, we believe that patients treated with IkT-148009 may have their disease halted, may see a progressive reduction in the need for symptomatic or supportive therapy and ultimately may not require symptomatic therapy if the functional reversal observed in the pre-clinical setting is observed in patients. We do not, however, know if any of these treatment outcomes will be observed in patients until formal studies are completed.
In the gut, we will take a unique approach to seeking approval for the GI complications in PD patients. In the GI, we will evaluate whole gut function using the wireless motility capsule known as SmartPillTM sold by Medtronic, a battery of clinical assessment scores and potentially biopsy to demonstrate if there is a statistically significant improvement in disease with concomitant clearance of alpha-synuclein pathology. The combination of these measures of GI function will represent a new approach to evaluating neurological function in PD patients with GI complications. We believe these quantitative measures in the GI augment analysis of therapeutic benefit in the brain. Trial design and the number of patients we intend to enroll in such studies will be discussed with the FDA in follow-up meetings, to include agreement on the meaning of treatment success inside and outside of the brain.
 IkT-001Pro: Validating our prodrug technology in stable phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
Market and Commercial Opportunity
IkT-001Pro is the first application of our prodrug technology that seeks to improve the oral absorption, reduce GI side effects and enhance the safety of active pharmaceutical ingredients. IkT-001Pro is a prodrug of the anti-cancer agent Imatinib, an FDA approved treatment for certain blood and stomach cancers. We plan to seek approval from the FDA for IkT-001Pro in stable phase CML as an orphan indication. In 2016, Imatinib became generic and up to eleven companies have been approved to sell generic Imatinib in the U.S. In 2019, sales for Imatinib generic and branded Imatinib sold as Gleevec® were approximately $350 million per year, at the close of 2020, indicative of a potentially robust commercial market for IkT-001Pro.
In non-human primates IkT-001Pro displayed a 5-fold higher NOAEL relative to Imatinib in 28-day toxicology studies. This suggests that IkT-001Pro could reduce some side effects common to Imatinib therapy for blood and stomach cancers in patients. As a consequence, we believe we have an opportunity to compete with generic Imatinib sales in the U.S. market if IkT-001Pro completes clinical development and is approved by the FDA. To achieve this commercial goal, we will require implementation of an appropriate commercial strategy for prescribers, pharmacy benefit managers and payors. Primary research to validate our strategy with pharmacy benefit managers and payors suggests a commercial path exists, passing through generic Imatinib. IkT-001Pro, if approved, could also compete for market share from other first line therapies for CML. One of the approved indications for Nilotinib (marketed as Tasigna®), for example, is for treatment of CML in patients that are Imatinib intolerant. Nilotinib’s label indicates it has serious cardiovascular adverse events. For those patients whose Imatinib-intolerance arises from on-dosing side effects, we believe they would elect to take IkT-001Pro as an alternative therapy if IkT-001Pro is shown to relieve those side effects in clinical trials and approved by the FDA.
Development Strategy for IkT-001Pro
CML is a proliferation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow with an incidence of 1 – 2 cases per 100,000 persons, and accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. Prevalence of this disease has steadily grown over the past decade, with nearly 200,000 patients projected to be afflicted with this disease by 2050. Pathogenesis of CML is linked to a mutation in the c-Abl gene, referred to as BCR-Abl. BCR-Abl is a form of the c-Abl protein kinase that is always in the “on” state, and accounts for excessive accumulation of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood that is associated with leukemia. Inhibition of BCR-Abl with Imatinib suppresses tumor growth. In clinical practice, Imatinib is very successful at suppressing tumor growth with an 81% event-free survival rate and a 93% overall survival rate. However, 8-year follow-up studies revealed that only 55% of patients remained on therapy at 8 years, indicating that treatment failure grew over time. Treatment failures occur for a variety of reasons. We believe failure to adhere to the daily treatment regimen makes a significant contribution to treatment failure for Imatinib therapy. For example, nearly 50% of patients experience nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that are not well managed. Missing just 5 days of therapy in the first 12 months of treatment reduces the likelihood of reaching cure at the end of the fourth year of treatment by nearly 25%. Thus, while Imatinib remains the medication of choice for CML, we believe that GI distress and other on-dosing side effects of Imatinib therapy degrade patient adherence and lead to substantial additional medical costs, which can reach $100,000 per patient in the U.S.

One of the key objectives for IkT-001Pro is to restore all patients to 100% treatment compliance by suppression of the GI and other on-dosing side effects for both branded and generic Imatinib.
Pharmacology of IkT-001Pro in preclinical models
We believe many of the side effects that degrade adherence to Imatinib therapy arise from GI distress on absorption. IkT-001Pro is a chemically modified form of Imatinib, which is absorbed intact and enzymatically releases Imatinib in the blood. Evaluation of the prodrug absorption and distribution in rats demonstrated that the exposure to Imatinib is significantly higher overall.
We have evaluated IkT-001Pro in a dose range finding study and in a pivotal 28-day GLP toxicology study in monkeys. For IkT-001Pro, the NOAEL is 5-fold higher for IkT-001Pro relative to Imatinib given alone. The higher NOAEL means that the prodrug drug suppressed some side effects that normally arise from Imatinib itself. In these studies, we observed that all the GI and other on-dosing side effects were suppressed at the NOAEL dose.
Clinical Development Strategy for IkT-001Pro in stable phase CML
Through pre-IND discussions with the FDA Division of Hematology, we believe approval of IkT-001Pro could be achieved through the 505(b)(2) regulation. We have advanced clinical batch manufacturing and pill formulation for our platform prodrug technology involving IkT-001Pro. Clinical batch manufacturing was completed in the first quarter of 2022 and the IND is planned to be filed in the second quarter of 2022, to include the production of the data package for the final pill formulation. The FDA has suggested that a single ascending dose clinical study comparing the dose of IkT-001Pro to 400 mg Imatinib could be sufficient for the dose calibration program if we match the pharmacokinetic profile of the two drugs over 96-hours in healthy volunteers.
We will evaluate IkT-001Pro in the clinic to determine if IkT-001Pro has superior safety relative to Imatinib using a novel scoring function recently developed to evaluate GI symptom severity in CML patients. In the pre-clinical setting, we have already compared Imatinib alone to a dose of IkT-001Pro to determine if Imatinib delivered as IkT-001Pro is safer than Imatinib alone. We observed that the NOAEL of Imatinib delivered as IkT-001Pro is 5-fold higher than for Imatinib alone. This suggests that Imatinib delivered as IkT-001Pro has safety benefits over Imatinib alone. In the clinic, we would complete dose calibration under the 505(b)(2) regulation to establish the dose of IkT-001Pro that is equivalent to that of 400 mg Imatinib in healthy volunteers; 400 mg Imatinib is the standard-of-care dose for treatment of CML in patients. Once we calibrate the dose of IkT001Pro that is equivalent to Imatinib 400 mg, and subject to agreements with the FDA for approval under the 505(b)(2) regulation, we plan to evaluate the safety benefit of IkT-001Pro in the post-market setting. The potential safety benefit of IkT-001Pro over Imatinib would be evaluated in stable phase CML patients using one of several designs under consideration, wherein patients on 400 mg Imatinib would be compared to the equivalent dose of IkT-001Pro and the side effects experienced in these patients on daily dosing would be recorded for up to 12 months.
Research Phase Programs in Other Neurological Diseases
Our RAMPTM medical chemistry program has also identified additional development opportunities for other neurological diseases which includes Dementia with Lewy Body or DLB, Multiple System Atrophy or MSA and Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy or PML.
Dementia with Lewy Body (DLB)
DLB is a Parkinson’s-like disease characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates, c-Abl activation and alpha-synuclein aggregate chemical modification much like that found in Parkinson's Disease. DLB is diagnosed by observation of a progressive onset of cognitive impairment that may be followed by motor function deficits and characterized morphologically by widespread cortical and subcortical α-synuclein/ Lewy body plus β-amyloid and tau pathologies. The clinical features of DLB include cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. PD and DLB are both Lewy Body disorders. PD and DLB share many features as the disease progresses, and therefore it is not surprising that PD and DLB share the involvement of alpha-synuclein aggregates and c-Abl activation. Most striking about DLB versus PD, however, is that DLB often occurs concomitant with the pathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), suggesting a mechanistic linkage between Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease. While it is possible to distinguish PD from DLB in the clinic using diagnostic procedures, it is not possible to create independent pre-clinical models for DLB and for PD. Unlike other alpha-synuclein-related disorders, such as MSA, there are no animal models that permit evaluation of cognitive function with no motor dysfunction. Therefore, we are using the properties determined for IkT-148009 to screen additional molecules from the 148x series and evaluating pharmacokinetics in animals to identify candidate(s) from the 148x series that share brain penetration, toxicology and other characteristics that are similar with IkT-148009. The development of an animal model to assess the therapeutic utility in DLB is not necessary because we believe the characteristics of a molecule suitable for treatment of DLB are similar to one used to treat PD given the significant overlap in disease pathology and clinical features. Rather, we are evaluating which of the 148x series molecules is the best candidate to follow IkT-148009 into the

clinic and planning the pre-clinical studies which will be required prior to evaluating the molecule clinically in patients with a formal diagnosis of DLB.
Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting approximately 15,000 to 50,000 people in the United States. It occurs sporadically in the fifth or sixth decade of life with a variable combination of parkinsonian, cerebellar, and autonomic features that rapidly progress to dangerous morbidity. Research toward potential treatments for MSA, as with many rare diseases, has been limited, resulting in a paucity of knowledge regarding its underlying causes, and there are no currently effective treatments to halt pathological progression. Initial clues into the origins of MSA came from studying alpha-synuclein and its hallmark histopathology in the brains of patients with MSA. These studies established that MSA is characterized by the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) that reside predominantly in oligodendroglial cells. GCIs are comprised of abnormal conformations of alpha-synuclein, the same protein that accumulates in neurons and Lewy Bodies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Finding similarities between MSA and PD is a complicated task, as alpha-synuclein mutations clinically and pathologically resemble MSA, while others have features of frontal lobe dementia with severe pathology. Further, some phenotypes of MSA have little or no clinically pertinent parkinsonism, and instead present with cerebellar ataxia or dysautonomia, most frequently as orthostatic hypotension. As MSA shares the hallmarks of c-Abl activation and alpha-synuclein chemical modification with Parkinson’s Disease, we believe that c-Abl inhibitor therapy holds promise as a treatment. We are working in collaboration with experts at Arizona State University, University of Bordeaux and Medical University of Innsbruck on this research program.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
PML emerged as an unusual form of cognitive decline during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, arising from the migration and lytic infection of the John Cunningham virus, or JCV, from its reservoirs in the kidney and bone marrow not the brain. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy that restored normal immune responses to viral infection in patients with HIV infection, the first reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patients since the era of the AIDS epidemic occurred during Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating natalizumab treatment for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against α4β1 and α4β7 integrins that blocks lymphocyte surveillance in the brain and can prevent multiple sclerosis-related clinical relapses. The co-occurrence of PML and multiple sclerosis was unanticipated. Once JCV enters the central nervous system, or CNS, JCV induces a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. The initial prevalence of natalizumab-associated PML in patients with multiple sclerosis was estimated to be 1 in 1000. However, as more PML cases emerged among natalizumab-treated patients, with substantial Wg in survivors, the prevalence of PML among patients treated with natalizumab for more than 24 months who also carried antibody evidence of JCV infection and previous immunosuppressant exposure, climbed to at least 1 in 70. Analysis of polyomavirus infection and reproduction in host cells revealed that polyomaviruses like JCV are dependent on c-Abl for viral entry into the cells it is going to infect. This suggests to us that c-Abl inhibitors could be an effective anti-viral strategy to block productive JCV infection inside and outside of its reservoirs in a living organism. We are working in collaboration with experts at Louisiana State University to explore this development opportunity.
Expertise and overall strategy
We have assembled a team of principals and advisors with deep scientific, clinical, business and leadership experience and expertise in drug development that includes neurodegenerative diseases. Our Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Milton H. Werner, Ph.D., is an internationally recognized scientist with a long history of conducting interdisciplinary research and executing on research programs in multiple therapeutic areas. Dr. Werner is a protein biochemist and structural biologist by training, enabling him and the team of principals and advisors we have assembled to develop and characterize a portfolio of novel c-Abl inhibitors and to rapidly determine their utility in a variety of model systems for specific diseases.
 Dr. Werner is joined by Terence Kelly, Ph.D., a 20-year veteran of medicinal chemistry at Boehringer-Ingelheim, Roger Rush, Ph.D., who has led IND-enabling programs for ground-breaking medications, like the Hepatitis C compound portfolio of Idenix, which was sold to Merck & Co., and Dr. Surendra Singh who has extensive experience in process scale and commercial manufacturing of drug substances. Our clinical development team is a collaboration between Clintrex Research Corporation and the Company. Clintrex is led by Karl Kieburtz, M.D. and Warran Olanow, M.D., two of the leading clinical investigators in neurodegenerative disease; Warren Olanow, MD is now the Company’s Interim Chief Medical Officer. Andrew McGarry, MD (Clintrex) is our clinical trial medical monitor and a team of clinical operations heads led by Sydney Kroger (Inhibikase) execute all phases of clinical research.
Our leadership team is complemented by leading clinicians and research investigators in the areas of neurodegeneration (Drs. Ted Dawson, Valina Dawson, Ken Marek, Jay Pasricha, Jeff Kordower, Karl Kieburtz and C. Warren Olanow and Robert Hauser). We have research collaborations with Dr. Jeffrey Kordower of Arizona State University and Dr. Jay Pasricha of Johns Hopkins

University. Collectively, this group of collaborators and advisors represent what we believe is the cutting edge of the fields of neuroscience and neurodegeneration.
Material Agreements
Clinical Research Organization Agreements
Our clinical development programs are a collaboration between Cognitive Research Corporation (CRC), the Hassman Research Institute (HRI) and Celerion, with clinical research management and data handling according to a statistical analysis plan conducted by CRC, clinical studies performed at HRI and analytical analysis of drug substance in biological fluids conducted by Celerion.
cGMP Manufacturing
Our chemical manufacturing organization is STA Pharmaceutical US LLC, a subsidiary of WuXiAppTec Co., Ltd., which is based in China and operates additional facilities in San Diego, California. STA provides process scale development and production of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Formulation and finishing services are provided through contracts on an as-needed basis including current Good Manufacturing Practice or cGMP manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Emerson Pace, a U.S. based fill and finishing manufacturer, is producing finished drug product for our current clinical programs. A second manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients is currently being evaluated through an active Request for Proposal (RFP) process led by the Company.
 License Agreements:
Emory University License Agreements
On June 8, 2010, the Company entered into two license agreements with Emory University, or Emory, the first for which the Company granted to Emory 393,370 shares of its stock (“License A”), and the second for which the Company granted to Emory 437,078 shares of its stock (“License B”). The Company recorded $313,500 which represented the fair value of the shares issued as part of the total consideration to Emory for the licenses. The fair value of the shares was determined to be more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration received. In exchange, Emory granted the Company and its affiliates an exclusive worldwide sublicensable right and license to practice under certain patent rights and technology to make, have, develop, promote, market, import, export, distribute, offer for sale, sell and otherwise use the licensed products in the field of use anywhere in the world. Unless sooner terminated as provided elsewhere in the agreement, the License A term is the later of 10 years or until the expiration of the patent rights. License B was terminated in May 2013 under the normal course of business. No shares were forfeited or returned and are still owned by Emory. License A was terminated in January, 2022 under the normal course of business.
 Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd.
On March 2, 2012, the Company entered into a collaborative research and development agreement, or the Sphaera Agreement with Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd., or Sphaera, to collaborate on the development of the prodrug technology to be applied to protein kinase inhibitors for oncology and non-oncology indications. Under the terms of the Sphaera Agreement, each party would retain its pre-existing intellectual property, but any intellectual property conceived or reduced to practice under and certain results arising from the Sphaera Agreement would be assigned to the Company. On October 5, 2012, the Company and Sphaera amended the Sphaera Agreement to reflect joint patent applications in the U.S. and India by us and Sphaera for a series of novel compounds. While the underlying intellectual property would be jointly owned, the Company has the exclusive right to commercialize 13 of the 24 linkers detailed in the filed patent applications, collectively, the Company Compounds, including the linker attached to Imatinib that comprises the 001Pro oncology product, with the remaining nine linkers owned by Sphaera, collectively, the Sphaera Compounds. Sphaera has the right to develop the Company Compounds for oncology indications but may not commercialize the Company Compounds unless the Company abandons the Company Compounds. The Company has notified Sphaera that it does not intend to abandon any of the Company Compounds. The Company currently does not have the right to develop the Sphaera Compounds. Additionally, if either party files an IND for a Company Compound for an oncology indication in humans, the non-filing party is prohibited from developing such Company Compound.
The prosecution of patents related to the Company Compounds, which includes the prodrug technology, is the responsibility of the Company.

As consideration for its services, Sphaera has received a fixed fee of $160,000 and is entitled to the following milestone payments upon achievement of specified milestones:


Milestone Event | Payment | 
First dosing of patient in US Phase 1 trial | $ | 250,000 
US Phase 1 trial completion with endpoints met | | 500,000 
US Phase 2 trial completion with endpoints met | | 875,000 
FDA Approval | | 4,000,000
Total potential milestone payments | $ | 5,625,000

 
No milestones have been achieved and, as such, no milestone payments have been made to Sphaera, and the Company does not anticipate that any milestone payments will be made to Sphaera within the next twelve months. Sphaera is also entitled to royalty payments of a percentage of annual net sales and sublicenses ranging in the mid-single digits.
The prosecution of patents related to the Company Compounds, which includes the prodrug technology, is the responsibility of the Company. The parties did not contemplate the development of IkT-001Pro as a competitor to the generic Imatinib now on the market. As such, we and Sphaera are re-negotiating our financial obligations to ensure furtherance of the product to market.
Commercialization Plan
We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs. We may develop one or all of our products and commercialize them ourselves, or we may license or form partnerships with other companies for commercialization of our products in the future.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry, including in the neurodegenerative disease field, is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
Our product candidates for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will compete with approved treatments as well as other therapies that may be in clinical or preclinical development or that have yet to be discovered. Historically, approved treatments for PD and related neurodegenerative disorders treat the symptoms of such diseases rather than halting or slowing the progression of the disease. We are not in the business of treating symptoms of disease. We intend to halt or slow the progression of the disease, which is known as disease modification and our product candidates are intended to modify disease. We believe that our product candidates, if approved by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad, will compete with other potential therapies intended to halt or slow the progression of neurodegenerative disease that are being developed by a number of companies and institutions. Several large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Prothena Corporation plc, Roche Holdings AG, Biogen Inc., Neurimmune Holding AG, UCB S.A., Neuropore Therapies, Inc., Sanofi S.A., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. are developing potentially disease modifying therapeutics for PD and are in various stages of clinical trials. Denali Therapeutics Inc. and Eli Lilly & Company are pursuing treatments for specific genetic defects that could prevent onset of disease or affect progression in Parkinson’s patients. In addition, a number of companies have developed c-Abl inhibitors for oncology and any one of them could be in possession of an inhibitor that could be used for clinical development for neurodegenerative diseases. These include Novartis AG, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Boehringer-Ingelheim GmbH and GlaxoSmithKline plc. Two companies, Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (SPARC) and First Biotherapeutics, Inc., have initiated clinical studies with proprietary c-Abl inhibitors for PD using molecules initially developed for treatment of blood cancer(s). In addition, we believe Botox® coupled with physical therapy is being explored in physician-led trials for neurogenic constipation, but we are not aware of any formal development programs by other companies.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, processes and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek and maintain patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. We endeavor to patent or in-license technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing terms of marketing or

data exclusivity, orphan drug status (if applicable), and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain territories, including the United States, Europe and Japan. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
For our product candidates, we generally pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. However, given that the development of our technology and product candidates is at an early stage, our intellectual property portfolio with respect to certain aspects of our technology and product candidates is also at an early stage. As further described below, we have filed or intend to file patent applications on various product candidates for composition of matter and other aspects of our technology and product candidates, and as we continue the development of our product candidates, we intend to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including protection for additional methods of use, formulation or manufacture.
We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Intellectual Property.”

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. The patent expirations reported below assume the patent is not rendered invalid or unenforceable by legal action and that all required fees are timely paid. In the United States, a patent may be entitled to Patent Term Adjustment for Patent Office delay. Where known, this has been included in the expiration dates described below. Further, in the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and the extension can only be obtained for patents covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our eligible products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
All of our novel compounds were funded in whole or in part by the U.S. government and are therefore subject to federal march-in rights. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the U.S. government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the U.S. government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf, commonly referred to as march-in rights.
 As of December 31, 2021, our patent portfolio included: (i) seven issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States and (ii) six issued foreign patents and eight pending foreign patent applications. Patents issuing from the applications in this portfolio, if granted, will expire between 2033 and 2037, not taking into account any potential patent-term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future.
One family of patents and applications covers compositions of matter for IkT-001Pro and related chemical compounds, as well as methods of using those compositions. This family includes two issued U.S. patents: U.S. Patent No. 9,487,500, which claims a genus of compounds including IkT-001Pro, and U.S. Patent No. 9,907,796, which claims methods of using a genus of compounds, including IkT-001Pro, to treat certain tumoral disease and certain infectious diseases. These U.S. Patents will expire between 2033 and 2034, not including any potential patent term extensions. This family does not include any pending patent applications in the U.S. Outside the U.S., this family includes issued patents in Europe, Japan, and Australia, and pending patent applications in Japan and Canada. Outside the U.S., patents issuing from the applications in this family, if granted, will expire in 2033, not taking into account any potential patent term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future. This family of patents and applications is jointly owned by us and Sphaera. Under the terms of our agreement with Sphaera, described above under “— Material Agreements — Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd.” we have the exclusive right to commercialize certain compounds disclosed in these applications, including IkT-001Pro, for cancer treatments. 

Two families of patents and applications cover compositions of matter for IkT-148009 and IkT-01427, the IkT-148x portfolio, and methods of use relating to those compositions. Patents issuing from the applications in these families, if granted, will expire between 2036 and 2037, not taking into account any potential patent-term adjustments or extensions that may be available in the future. These families include five issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications in the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada, and Europe. The issued patents, U.S. Patent No. 9,828,370, U.S. Patent No. 10,118,923, U.S. Patent No. 10,316,031, U.S. Patent No. 10,344,027, and U.S. Patent No. 10,906,896, will expire in 2036, not including any potential patent term extensions, and include claims that cover compositions of matter for IkT-148009 and IkT-01427, as well as claims that cover methods of using those compositions to treat certain cancers and certain infectious diseases. These families are solely owned by us. 
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with cGCPs, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA; 


•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 •payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
 Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity, to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes

to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that

such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
505(b)(2) Pathway
The 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) is an FDA abbreviated drug approval pathway. The pathway was created by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, with 505(b)(2) referring to a section of the FDCA. The provisions of 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (“reference” or “listed”) drug; the section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) NDA contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The FDA may also require the applicant to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that such disease or condition affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a

condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our operations include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; 
 •federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent; 
 •provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer. 
Regulation Outside the United States
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
To market our future products in the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
•The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and 
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
   U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new molecular entity. A drug is a new molecular entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug

containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the federal Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS has proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the

manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug prices are determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
