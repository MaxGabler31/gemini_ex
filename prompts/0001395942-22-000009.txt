Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of used vehicle auctions and related vehicle remarketing services in North America and Europe. We leverage technology to facilitate an efficient marketplace by providing auction services for sellers of used, or "whole car," vehicles through our digital marketplaces supported by more than 70 vehicle logistics center locations across North America at December 31, 2021. In 2021, we facilitated the sale of approximately 2.6 million used vehicles. Our revenues are generated through auction fees from both vehicle buyers and sellers, as well as by providing value-added ancillary services, including transportation, reconditioning, inspections, marshalling, titling, collateral recovery services and floorplan financing. We facilitate the transfer of ownership directly from seller to buyer and generally we do not take title to or ownership of vehicles sold through our auctions.
Our end-to-end platform serves the remarketing needs of OEMs, dealers, fleet operators, rental companies and financial institutions. We are an auction company that provides advanced and integrated mobile, digital and on-premise marketplaces. We are a technology company that delivers next generation tools to accelerate and simplify remarketing. We also leverage data to inform and empower our customers with clear, actionable insights.
ADESA, our whole car auction services business, is the second largest provider of used vehicle auction services in North America. Vehicles at ADESA's auctions are typically sold by used vehicle dealers, vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies, financial institutions, commercial fleet operators and rental car companies to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. Through ADESA.com, ADESA provides a comprehensive remarketing solution to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies, lease and daily rental car companies and financial institutions. The Company operates BacklotCars, CARWAVE and TradeRev digital auction platforms to serve wholesale transactions between automotive dealers. An important component of ADESA's services to its buyers is providing short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent used vehicle dealers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, AFC, which has approximately 100 locations throughout North America.
At December 31, 2021, the Company provided ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+ digital auction platforms through a North American network of more than 70 vehicle logistics center locations. ADESA also includes ADESA Remarketing Limited, an online whole car vehicle remarketing business in the United Kingdom and ADESA Europe (formerly known as CarsOnTheWeb), an online wholesale vehicle auction marketplace in Continental Europe. We believe our extensive geographic network and diverse product offerings enable us to leverage relationships with providers and buyers of used vehicles.
Our Corporate History
KAR Auction Services, Inc., doing business as KAR Global, was incorporated in 2006 and commenced operations in 2007. ADESA entered the vehicle remarketing industry in 1989 and first became a public company in 1992. In 1994, ADESA acquired AFC. ADESA remained a public company until 1995 when ALLETE, Inc. purchased a majority of its outstanding equity interests. In 2004, ALLETE, Inc. sold 20% of ADESA to the public and then spun off their remaining 80% interest to shareholders. ADESA was acquired by the Company in 2007. At that time the Company also acquired Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc. ("IAA"), a North American salvage auction business. In a series of transactions between 2012 and 2013, our former owners (private equity investors) sold all of their common stock in secondary offerings. In 2019, IAA was separated from KAR Auction Services through a tax-free spin-off and now operates as a separate entity (NYSE: IAA).
Our Industry
Auctions are the hub of the remarketing system for used vehicles, bringing professional sellers and buyers together and creating a marketplace for the sale of these vehicles. Whole car auction vehicles include vehicles from dealers turning their inventory, off-lease vehicles, vehicles repossessed by financial institutions and rental and other fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage. The following are key industry highlights:
Whole Car Auction Industry Volumes
Whole car auction volumes in North America, including off-premise volumes and mobile application volumes, were approximately 10.3 million in 2020. Data for the whole car auction industry is collected by the National Auto Auction Association ("NAAA") through an annual survey. NAAA industry volumes for 2021 have not yet been released, but we expect that volumes in 2021 were lower than in 2020. The NAAA industry volumes collected by the annual survey do not include off-premise volumes or mobile application volumes (e.g., Openlane, BacklotCars, CARWAVE, TradeRev and their respective competitors), but we have included estimates of these volumes in our industry totals. The COVID-19 pandemic and current 
market conditions facing the automotive industry, including the disruption of new vehicle production, have had a material impact on the whole car auction industry and we are unable to estimate future volumes.
Whole Car Market
The North American used vehicle auction market is largely consolidated. Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc. and ADESA are the two largest auction providers in the North American whole car auction market. The remaining providers in the market are substantially smaller in size. 
Floorplan Financing
An important component of the whole car auction industry is providing short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing. By providing buyers (primarily independent used vehicle dealers) access to capital, the independent used vehicle dealers are able to place inventory on their lots. AFC and its competitors play a significant role in the whole car auction industry by providing liquidity in the auction lanes.
Our Business Strategy
KAR’s strategy is to be the world’s leading digital marketplace for used vehicles. This progressive strategy reflects the shifting landscape of the remarketing industry and automotive sector, the evolving needs and expectations of our customers and the opportunities that emerged and accelerated with the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The strategy builds on KAR’s integrated technology and data analytics capabilities while leveraging the Company’s broad geographic footprint and physical infrastructure. 
We are committed to the digital transformation of wholesale remarketing. We believe digital platforms benefit sellers by attracting a larger buyer-base, providing greater flexibility around when and where to launch sales, and enabling more advanced and targeted marketing techniques. We believe buyers benefit from digital platforms through greater transparency, access to inventory beyond their local auction market and the ability to browse, bid and buy safely and conveniently from any location, on any device, at any time. For KAR, going digital enables a faster, more agile and efficient operating model, which should in turn deliver greater value to our stakeholders.
KAR has identified four strategic priorities that we believe will advance this strategy and continue to position our company for the future. Those priorities are:
•Digital transformation;
•Growing dealer consignment; 
•Expanding our commercial business; and
•Improve the customer experience.
Digital transformation: The cornerstone of digital transformation is technology, so we intend to continue to invest in new digital platforms, data analytics capabilities and digital talent to power our marketplaces. We are transforming our operating model and enabling functions to support KAR’s digital future. 
•Physical locations & operations: ADESA’s physical locations across North America provide comprehensive services to on-premise and off-premise customers, including inspection, reconditioning, mechanical work, storage and logistics. We intend to continue to invest in new technology and processes to transform how we approach the work performed at these locations to reduce cycle time, improve the services offered and create new opportunities for revenue generation. 
•Enabling capabilities: We also understand that as transactions become more digital, our capabilities need to evolve to meet the increased customer needs and expectations in a digital marketplace. We are enhancing our imaging, inspection and vehicle representation capabilities to more closely simulate seeing and touching a vehicle on-premise. We also intend to continue to build on and diversify our data and analytics capabilities to provide our customers with actionable information to help them make better buying and selling decisions.
•Talent: The Company’s shift to a digital model has enabled us to become a more efficient organization. We are reducing on-premise labor while increasing resource levels in our technology, engineering, analytics and product teams. We will continue to evaluate our talent pool and seek new talent where necessary. 
Growing dealer consignment: The dealer consignment business represents approximately one-third of the Company’s historical transaction portfolio and we believe an area with significant opportunity for growth. Over the past several years, KAR has completed three strategic acquisitions to capture greater share in this space: BacklotCars, CARWAVE and TradeRev. The platforms provide dealers with fast, easy mobile-app solutions to sell and source inventory from other dealers. They provide comprehensive vehicle condition reports, greater transparency into bidding activity, and real-time market price discovery on listed vehicles. The Company is integrating and leveraging technology, capabilities and staff from BacklotCars, CARWAVE, TradeRev and ADESA to deliver what we believe will be the best digital dealer-to-dealer solution in the market.
Expanding our commercial business: The commercial consignment business represents approximately two-thirds of the Company’s historical transactional volume, and growing our share in this area remains a strategic priority. The Company's commercial offerings include Openlane, ADESA Simulcast and Simulcast+. The foundation of KAR’s commercial offering is Openlane, the digital platform powering more than 40 private label websites for our OEM and financial institution consignor customers. We continue to invest in staff and technology to enhance the digital experience for our commercial customers using any of our multiple platforms. 
Improve the customer experience: Ultimately, the transition to a fully digital business requires an exceptional customer experience. We are developing and improving our offerings to deliver a more simplified, intuitive and customer-centric user experience. We are also working towards centralizing many key customer support and administrative functions to ensure a faster, more predictable and consistent experience for our customers.
Our Business Segments
We operate as two reportable business segments: ADESA Auctions and AFC. Our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were distributed as follows: ADESA 87% and AFC 13%. 
ADESA
Overview
We are the second largest provider of whole car auctions and related services to the vehicle remarketing industry in North America. We serve our customer base through digital marketplaces and strategically located vehicle logistics centers that are developed to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely via ADESA.com or in person. Our online service offerings allow us to offer vehicles for sale from any location. On-premise marketplace sales are initiated online for vehicles at one of our locations across North America and include ADESA Simulcast, Simulcast+ and DealerBlock sales. Off-premise marketplace sales are initiated online and include Openlane, BacklotCars, CARWAVE, TradeRev and ADESA Europe sales.
Vehicles available at our auctions include vehicles from commercial customers such as off-lease vehicles, repossessed vehicles, rental vehicles and other fleet vehicles that have reached a predetermined age or mileage, as well as vehicles from used vehicle dealers turning their inventory. The number of vehicles offered for sale at auction is the key driver of our costs incurred in the whole car auction process, and the number of vehicles sold is the key driver of the related fees generated by the remarketing process.
We offer both on-premise and off-premise marketplaces, as well as value-enhancing ancillary services in an effective and efficient manner to maximize returns for the sellers of used vehicles. We quickly transfer the vehicles and ownership to the buyer and the net funds to the seller. Vehicles are typically offered for sale at on-premise marketplaces on at least a weekly basis at most ADESA locations and the auctions are simulcast over the Internet with streaming audio and video (ADESA Simulcast) so that remote bidders can participate via our online products. Our online auctions (DealerBlock, BacklotCars, CARWAVE and TradeRev) function 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing our customers with maximum exposure for their vehicles and the flexibility to offer vehicles at "buy now" prices or in auctions that last for a few hours, days or even weeks. We also provide customized "private label" selling systems (including "buy now" functionality as well as online auctions) for our customers.
We generate revenue from auction fees paid by vehicle buyers and sellers, as well as fees from related services. Generally, we do not take title to or bear the risk of loss for vehicles sold at whole car auctions. Our buyer fees are typically based on a tiered structure with fees increasing with the sale price of the vehicle, while seller fees are typically fixed. We add buyer fees to the gross sales price paid by buyers for each vehicle, and generally customers do not receive title or possession of vehicles after purchase until payment is received, proof of floorplan financing is provided or credit is approved. We generally deduct seller fees and other ancillary service fees to sellers from the gross sales price of each vehicle before remitting the net amount to the seller. ADESA also sells vehicles that have been purchased, which represent approximately 1% of total vehicles sold. 
Customers
Suppliers of vehicles to our whole car auctions primarily include (i) large institutions, such as vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance subsidiaries, vehicle rental companies, financial institutions, and commercial fleets and fleet management companies (collectively "commercial customers"); and (ii) franchised and independent used vehicle dealers (collectively "dealer customers"). Buyers of vehicles on our auction platforms primarily include franchised and independent used vehicle dealers. 
Services
Our whole car auctions also provide a full range of innovative and value-added services to sellers and buyers that enable us to serve as a "one-stop shop." Many of these services may be provided or purchased independently from the auction process, including:

Services | Description 
Auction Related Services | ADESA provides marketing and advertising for the vehicles to be auctioned, dealer registration, storage and security of consigned inventory, auction vehicle registration, condition report processing, photo services, pre-sale lineups, auctioning of vehicles by licensed auctioneers, arbitration of disputes, post-sale inspections, title processing, clearing of funds and sales results reports. 
Transportation Services | We provide both inbound (pickup) and outbound (delivery) transportation services utilizing our own equipment and personnel as well as licensed and insured third party carriers. Through our subsidiary, CarsArrive, and its Internet-based system which provides automated vehicle shipping services, customers can instantly review price quotes and delivery times, and vehicle transporters can check available loads and also receive instant notification of available shipments. The same system is utilized at our auctions; however, CarsArrive also arranges transportation for non-auction vehicles.
Reconditioning Services | Our vehicle logistics centers provide detailing, body work, paintless dent repair ("PDR"), light mechanical work, glass repair, tire and key replacement and upholstery repair. Key replacement services are primarily provided by our subsidiary, High Tech Locksmiths ("HTL"). 
Inspection Services | AutoVIN provides vehicle condition reporting, inventory verification auditing, program compliance auditing and facility inspections. Field managers are equipped with handheld computers and digital cameras to record all inspection and audit data on-site. The same technology is utilized at our vehicle logistics center locations and we believe that the expanded utilization of comprehensive vehicle condition reports with pictures facilitates dealers sourcing vehicles via the Internet. 
Title and Repossession Administration and Remarketing Services | PAR provides end-to-end management of the remarketing process including titling, repossession administration, inventory management, auction selection, pricing and representation of the vehicles at auction for those customers seeking to outsource all or just a portion of their remarketing needs. Recovery Database Network, Inc. ("RDN") is a specialized provider of B2B software and data solutions for automotive lenders and repossession companies. Clearplan is closely integrated with RDN, providing users with convenient data-flows and access to its recovery management platform. 
Vehicle Research Services | Autoniq provides dealers real-time vehicle information such as pricing, history reports and market guides. Its mobile app allows used car dealers to scan VINs on mobile devices, view auction run lists and access vehicle history reports and market value reports instantly. Autoniq offers access to valued resources such as CARFAX and AutoCheck, as well as Black Book Daily, NADA guides, Kelley Blue Book and Galves pricing guide information. It also includes a comprehensive wholesale and retail market report for all markets in the United States. 
KAR Global Analytical Services | KAR Global Analytical Services provides value-added market analysis to our customers and the media. These services include access to publications and custom analysis of wholesale market trends for KAR's customers, including peer group and market benchmarking studies, analysis of the benefits of reconditioning, site selection for optimized remarketing of vehicles, portfolio analysis of auction sales and computer-generated mapping and buyer analysis. 
Data as a Service | Our Data as a Service team aggregates automotive retail, pricing, registration and other market and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. The insights generated from that data are deployed through predictive pricing, inventory management and vehicle matching tools that help customers buy, sell and source vehicles. 

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing approach at ADESA is to develop strong relationships and interactive dialogue with our customers. We have relationship managers for the various commercial customers, including vehicle manufacturers, fleet companies, rental car companies, finance companies and others. These relationship managers focus on current trends and customer needs for their respective customers in order to better coordinate our sales effort and service offerings.
Managers of individual auction locations are ultimately responsible for providing services to the commercial customers whose vehicles are directed to the auctions by the corporate sales team. Developing and servicing the largest possible population of buying dealers for the vehicles consigned for sale at each auction is integral to maximizing value for our vehicle suppliers. 
We have local sales representatives who have experience in the used vehicle business and an intimate knowledge of local markets. These local representatives focus on the dealer segment and are complemented by a centralized team of inventory consultants matching buyers and inventory. Both the local sales representatives and the inventory consultants are managed by a corporate-level team focused on developing and implementing standard best practices and expanding relationships with major dealer groups. We believe this combination of a centralized structure with decentralized resources enhances relationships with the dealer community and may further increase dealer consignment business at our auctions.
Through our KAR Global Analytical Services department, we also provide market analysis to our customers, as they use analytical techniques in making their remarketing decisions.
Online Solutions
Our current online solutions include:

ADESA Technology | Description 
ADESA Simulcast® / Simulcast+® | Our live auction Internet bidding solution, ADESA Simulcast®, operates in concert with our on-premise marketplaces and provides registered buyers with the opportunity to participate in live auctions. Potential buyers bid online in real time along with the live local bidders and other Internet bidders via a simple, web-based interface. ADESA Simulcast® provides real-time streaming audio and video from the live auction and still images of vehicles and other data.

ADESA Market Guide® | Provides wholesale auction prices, auction sales results, market data and vehicle condition information. 

Competition
In the North American whole car auction industry, we compete with Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., OVE.com (Manheim's "Online Vehicle Exchange"), RMS Automotive (a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc.), SmartAuction (a subsidiary of Ally Bank), as well as several smaller chains of auctions, independent auctions and a number of digital auction platforms, including Auction Edge, ACV and EBlock auctions. In addition, used car retailers, such as CarMax and Carvana, have developed proprietary auction platforms for selling vehicles to other dealers. In the United States, competition is strongest with Manheim for the supply of used vehicles from national commercial customers. In Canada, we are the largest provider of whole car vehicle auction services. The supply of vehicles from dealers is dispersed among all of the auctions in the used vehicle market.
The whole car auction industry is highly fragmented in Europe where we compete primarily with British Car Auctions and Manheim. There are also a number of small independent auction operations throughout Europe. 
In the dealer-to-dealer auction market, our mobile applications, BacklotCars, CARWAVE and TradeRev, currently compete with ACV Auctions, EBlock, Manheim Express, TradeHelper and others. 
AFC
Overview
We are a leading provider of floorplan financing to independent used vehicle dealers. We provide short-term inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, to independent used vehicle dealers through locations throughout North America. In 2021, AFC serviced approximately 1.4 million loan transactions, which includes both loans paid off and loans extended, or curtailed. We sell the majority of our U.S. dollar-denominated finance receivables without recourse to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which sells an undivided participation interest in such finance receivables to a group of bank purchasers on a revolving basis. We also securitize the majority of our Canadian dollar denominated finance receivables through a separate third-party facility. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from fees. These fees include origination, floorplan, curtailment and other related program fees. When the loan is extended or paid in full, AFC collects all accrued fees and interest.
Customers and Locations
Floorplan financing supports independent used vehicle dealers in North America who purchase vehicles from our auctions, other auctions and non-auction purchases. In 2021, approximately 90% of the vehicles floorplanned by AFC were vehicles purchased by dealers at any auction. Our ability to provide floorplan financing facilitates the growth of vehicle sales at auction. As of December 31, 2021, we serviced auctions through approximately 100 locations which are conveniently located at or within close proximity of auctions held by ADESA and other auctions, which allows dealers to reduce transaction time by providing immediate payment for vehicles purchased at auction. We provide availability lists on behalf of our customers to auction representatives regarding the financing capacity of our customers, thereby increasing the purchasing potential at auctions. In addition, we normally have the ability to send finance representatives on-site to most approved independent auctions during auction sale-days, as well as maintaining a presence at the ADESA auctions. Geographic proximity to the customers gives our employees the ability to stay in close contact with outstanding accounts, thereby better enabling them to manage credit risk.
As of December 31, 2021, AFC had approximately 11,400 active dealers with an average line of credit of approximately $350,000 and no one dealer representing greater than 1.5% of our portfolio. An average of approximately 14 vehicles per active dealer were floorplanned with an approximate average value outstanding of $15,300 per vehicle as of December 31, 2021.
Sales and Marketing
AFC approaches and seeks to expand its share of the independent dealer floorplan market through a number of methods and channels. We target and solicit new dealers through both direct sales efforts at the dealer's place of business as well as auction-based sales and customer service representatives, who service our dealers at auctions where they replenish and rotate vehicle inventory. These largely local efforts are handled by field personnel. AFC's corporate-level team and Business Development Center also provide sales and marketing support to AFC field personnel by helping to identify new dealer opportunity and coordinating promotional activity with auctions and other vehicle supply sources. AFC also relies on the utilization of actionable data to drive the business forward (predictive modeling from historical and real-time data). 
Credit
Our procedures and proprietary computer-based system enable us to manage our credit risk by tracking each vehicle from origination to payoff, while expediting services through our field network. Typically, we assess a floorplan fee at the inception of a loan and we collect all accrued fees and interest when the loan is extended or repaid in full. In addition, AFC generally holds the title or other evidence of ownership to all vehicles which are floorplanned. Typical loan terms are 30 to 90 days, each with a possible loan extension. For an additional fee, this loan extension allows the dealer to extend the duration of the loan beyond the original term for another 30 to 90 days if the dealer makes payment towards principal and pays accrued fees and interest.
The extension of a credit line to a dealer starts with the underwriting process. Credit lines up to $600,000 are extended using a proprietary scoring model developed internally by AFC. Credit lines in excess of $600,000 may be extended using underwriting guidelines which generally require dealership and personal financial statements, monthly bank statements, sales reports and tax returns. The underwriting of each line of credit requires an analysis, write-up and recommendation by the credit department and, in case of credit lines in excess of $600,000, final review by a credit committee.
Collateral Management
Collateral management is an integral part of daily operations at each AFC location, including our corporate headquarters. AFC's proprietary computer-based system facilitates this daily collateral management by providing real-time access to dealer information and enables field and corporate personnel to assess and manage potential collection issues. Restrictions are automatically placed on customer accounts in the event of a delinquency, payments by dealers from bank accounts with insufficient funds or poor audit results. Field personnel are proactive in managing collateral by monitoring loans and notifying dealers that payments are coming due. In addition, approximately 50,000 routine audits, or inventory audits, are performed annually on the dealers' lots through our AutoVIN subsidiary. The audit reconciliation process is now centralized in order to better mitigate risk and free up field personnel time to focus on the customer. Poor results from inventory audits typically require personnel to take actions to determine the status of missing collateral, including visiting the dealer personally, verifying units held off-site and collecting payments for units sold. Audits also identify troubled accounts, triggering the involvement of AFC's collections department.
AFC operates two divisions which are organized into ten regions in North America. Each division and region is monitored by managers who oversee daily operations. At the corporate level, AFC employs full-time collection specialists and collection attorneys who are assigned to specific regions and monitor collection activity for these areas. Collection specialists work closely with the field offices to track trends before an account becomes a troubled account and to determine, together with collection attorneys, the best strategy to secure the collateral once a troubled account is identified.
Securitization
AFC sells the majority of its U.S. dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote, consolidated, special purpose subsidiary ("AFC Funding Corporation"), established for the purpose of purchasing AFC's finance receivables. A securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by AFC Funding Corporation to a group of bank purchasers of undivided interests in certain finance receivables subject to committed liquidity. AFC's securitization facility has been in place since 1996. AFC Funding Corporation had a committed facility of $1.70 billion from a third-party facility for U.S. finance receivables at December 31, 2021. The agreement expires on January 31, 2024.
We also have an agreement in place for the securitization of Automotive Finance Canada Inc.'s ("AFCI") receivables. This securitization facility provides up to C$225 million in financing for eligible finance receivables through a third-party conduit (separate from the U.S. facility). The agreement expires on January 31, 2024. The receivables sold pursuant to both the U.S. and Canadian securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings.
Competition
AFC primarily provides short-term dealer floorplan financing of wholesale vehicles to independent vehicle dealers in North America. At the national level, AFC's competition includes NextGear Capital, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc., other specialty lenders, banks and financial institutions. At the local level, AFC faces competition from banks, credit unions and independent auctions who may offer floorplan financing to local auction customers. Such entities typically service only one or a small number of auctions.
Some of our industry competitors who operate whole car auctions on a national scale may endeavor to capture a larger portion of the floorplan financing market. AFC competes primarily on a relationship basis, focusing on quality of service, convenience of payment, scope of services offered to solve customer pain points and consistent commitment to the sector. This and our long-term relationships with customers have been established over time and act as a competitive strength for us.
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, holidays and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications, provide certain disclosures and notices, limit interest rates, fees and other charges and protect personal data. Some examples of the regulations and laws that impact our company are included in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" under the risk: "We are subject to a complex framework of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations, which have in the past, and could in the future, subject us to claims, challenge our business model, or otherwise harm our business." Changes in government regulations or interpretations of existing regulations could result in increased costs, reduced vehicle prices and decreased profitability for us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future regulations or changes in existing regulations or in their interpretation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to liability, damage our reputation and require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.
In the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. Some of the facilities on which we operate are impacted by recognized environmental concerns and pollution conditions. We have incurred and may in the future incur expenditures relating to compliance and risk mitigation efforts, releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.
Management considers the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss (or range of possible losses) can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted. Accruals for contingencies including environmental matters are included in "Other accrued expenses" at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. If the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued, this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period.
Employees and Human Capital
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,600 employees, of which approximately 7,100 were located in the U.S. and approximately 2,500 were located in Canada, Europe, Mexico, Uruguay and the Philippines. Approximately 86% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. Currently, less than 1% of our employees participate in collective bargaining agreements. We have also established a works council in Belgium pursuant to local law. In addition to the employee workforce, we utilize independent contractors and temporary labor services to provide certain services.
Our people have been critical to our digital transformation. Led by our Chief People Officer, we have programs and practices in place to onboard, support and retain our talent, and to source new talent in a highly competitive environment. We recognize the importance of our workforce and the employee experience, and strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits while fostering a culture of open dialogue, inclusion and belonging. Additionally, we enable support functions and people managers that are dedicated to the growth and development of our teams.
