Item 1. Business
Our Company 
Verint® Systems Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Verint”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise) helps brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. For more than two decades, the world’s most iconic brands – including more than 85 of the Fortune 100 companies – have trusted Verint to provide the technology and domain expertise they require to effectively build enduring customer relationships.
Verint is uniquely positioned to help organizations close the Engagement Capacity Gap™ with our differentiated Verint Customer Engagement Cloud Platform. Brands today are challenged by new workforce dynamics, ever-expanding customer engagement channels and exponentially more consumer interactions – often while facing limited budgets and resources. As a result, brands are finding it more challenging to deliver the desired customer experience. This creates a capacity gap, which is widening as the digital transformation continues. Organizations are increasingly seeking technology to close this gap with solutions that are based on artificial intelligence (AI) and are developed specifically for customer engagement. These solutions automate workflows across enterprise silos to optimize the workforce expense and at the same time drive an elevated consumer experience. 
Verint is headquartered in Melville, New York, and has more than 30 offices worldwide. We have approximately 4,400 passionate professionals around the globe exclusively focused on helping brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. 
Background
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. 
On February 1, 2021, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Cognyte Software Ltd. (“Cognyte”), whose business and operations consisted of our former Cyber Intelligence Solutions business (the “Cognyte Business”), into an independent public company. The Spin-Off of Cognyte was completed by way of a pro rata distribution in which holders of Verint’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, received one ordinary share of Cognyte, no par value, for every share of common stock of Verint held of record as of the close of business on January 25, 2021. After the distribution, we do not beneficially own any ordinary shares of Cognyte and no longer consolidate Cognyte into our financial results for periods ending after January 31, 2021. The Spin-Off was intended to be generally tax-free to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The historical results of operations and financial positions of Cognyte are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. For further information on discontinued operations, see Note 2, “Discontinued Operations” in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Through our website at www.verint.com, we make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, filed or furnished by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish such materials to, the SEC.

Market Opportunity
The customer engagement market is increasingly embracing digital transformation across the enterprise while also transitioning to the cloud. With the shift to digital, brands are experiencing an increasing number of customer interactions as well as elevated customer expectations for faster and more consistent and contextual responses across any engagement channel. With the constraints of limited budget and resources, brands realize that hiring more workers and increasing workforce expense is not a sustainable solution. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap™, and as consumer adoption of digital accelerates, the gap is widening. Many brands are already experiencing the consequences of the widening gap and face the risk of declining brand reputation and customer attrition. The market is seeking new customer engagement technology and the opportunity is to use innovative AI, specifically designed for customer engagement automation, that can help brands close this gap.
The Opportunity: Close the Engagement Capacity Gap™
Market Trends
We believe there are three market trends that are benefiting Verint today: the acceleration of digital transformation, changes in the workforce shaping the future of work, and elevated customer expectations.
•Acceleration of Digital Transformation: Digital transformation is accelerating, and it is driving significant change in customer engagement for the contact center and across the enterprise. Long gone are the days when customer journeys were limited to phone calls into a contact center. Today, customer journeys take place across many touchpoints in the enterprise and across many communication and collaboration platforms, with digital leading the way. Customer touchpoints take place in contact centers, in back-office and branch operations, in ecommerce, in digital marketing, in self-service, and in customer experience departments. We believe that the breadth of customer touchpoints across the enterprise and the rapid growth in digital interactions benefit Verint as these trends create demand for new solutions that increase automation and connect organizational silos to increase efficiency and elevate the customer experience.
•A Changing Workforce Shapes the Future of Work: Brands are facing unprecedented challenges when it comes to how they manage their changing workforce. Increasingly, brands are managing employees that may work from anywhere. Providing flexibility for where their employees work creates challenges in managing and coaching their teams. And because of the limited resources that are available, brands must find ways to use technology like AI-powered bots to augment their workforce. “The Great Resignation” has put a spotlight on the importance of employee experience and brands must quickly evolve how they recruit, onboard, and retain employees. We believe that these trends benefit Verint as they create demand for new solutions that can shape the future of work, with a workforce of people and bots working together, increased automation, greater employee flexibility, and a greater focus on the voice of the employees.
•Elevated Customer Expectations: Customer expectations for faster, more consistent, and contextual responses continue to rise, and meeting those expectations is becoming more difficult with legacy technology. The increase in the number of channels and customer desire to seamlessly shift between channels creates a more complex customer journey for brands to support and manage. Customers also expect that each brand will have a deep understanding of the customer’s relationship with the brand - one that is unified across the enterprise regardless of whether the customer touchpoint is in the contact center, on a website, through a mobile app, or in the back office or branch. We believe that this trend benefits Verint as it creates demand for new solutions that help brands support complex customer journeys and increase automation to meet elevated customer expectations.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help brands close the Engagement Capacity Gap with our innovative, AI-powered, cloud platform. Our platform helps brands create significant business value throughout the organization by introducing automation and workflows to reduce operating costs while at the same time increasing customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities.
We designed the Verint Customer Engagement Cloud Platform based on an open multi-cloud architecture and with an open strategy. This open approach enables Verint to innovate at an accelerated pace, and helps brands to seamlessly integrate the platform into their specific ecosystem as well as to quickly consume new applications on the platform to address pressing business needs. This approach also empowers our broad set of partners to easily integrate with our platform and provide their customers with value-added services. Our strategy is to continue expanding our partner network to address both the small to medium sized business (SMB) and enterprise segments of the markets across many vertical industries.
Below are the key elements of our platform, including how we have architected our platform to support multiple cloud environments to accelerate innovation, our open approach to the ecosystem which has made us easy to work with, our market leading Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics™ and our robust Engagement Data Hub: 
•Open Multi-Cloud Architecture: The shift to cloud, the explosion in AI, and the growth of the application programming interface (API) economy have dramatically changed customer and partner expectations regarding what they need from their core technology vendors. The days of the closed ecosystem are long gone. With an open cloud architecture, the Verint Cloud Platform was designed for multi-cloud support, capable of running in the leading cloud infrastructure environments. The open cloud architecture accelerates innovation by standardizing our approach to microservice container architectures and fully automated development operations to speed development while improving reliability and security.
•Open Approach to the Ecosystem: Because it is designed to be open, the Verint Cloud Platform can seamlessly fit into a brand’s enterprise ecosystem. The open and extensible architecture enables the platform to easily integrate and augment the brand’s existing systems of record such as customer relationship management (CRM). The platform is designed to manage a large volume of engagement data and seamlessly integrate with the brand’s enterprise data strategy. The platform is agnostic to communication infrastructure choices and seamlessly integrates with a brand’s existing CCaaS (contact center as-a-service), UCaaS (unified communications as-a-service), and CPaaS (communications platform as-a-service) solutions. Verint’s open cloud platform is more than the technology alone – it provides an opportunity for our customers and partners to build a community through our Verint Connect web portal. Verint Connect can be accessed directly from our cloud platform and provides the tools and resources to foster a rich partner and customer ecosystem around our applications. These tools include a marketplace where Verint and partner components are made available to accelerate time to value with downloadable extensions, and a developer portal where customers can engage directly with the Verint technical community. Our APIs are available to test, with code samples, developer sandboxes, downloadable test clients, education, and discussion forums. Verint Connect also provides access to educational courses, our support teams, a knowledgebase and a community for customers and partners to interact with each other.
•Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics: We believe Verint is leading the market with AI solutions specifically designed for customer engagement. Verint’s AI capabilities, named Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics are embedded natively in the core of the Verint Cloud Platform. Verint Da Vinci is used by the business applications running in the platform to infuse AI across the platform. Verint Da Vinci capabilities are the result of over two decades of research into optimizing customer engagement and use state-of-the-art machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms. Honed on our unique data set, Verint Da Vinci is supported by Verint Labs, which features a large and growing team of data and AI scientists, working on pure and applied research to advance Verint Da Vinci and solve global customer engagement challenges.
•Engagement Data Hub: The Verint Cloud Platform includes an Engagement Data Hub. Interaction data captured from multiple voice, video, digital, and social communication systems, experience data captured from multiple survey systems, and enrichment data from systems of record, are unified and managed in a single data hub at the core of the platform. Engagement data in the hub is made available for Verint Da Vinci algorithms, for any Verint application which requires access to it, as well as for the brand’s data lake strategy, to its business intelligence tools, and to its partners who need data to develop their own applications. Verint applications use the engagement data in the hub to address multiple use cases for brands, including contact center analytics, enterprise analytics, customer journey analytics, workforce compliance with policies and regulations, and fraud mitigation.
Our Customer Engagement Solutions
The Verint Cloud Platform offers a broad set of solutions, to help brands close the Engagement Capacity Gap. The platform is open and modular to offer maximum flexibility. Brands can choose to deploy solutions by starting anywhere based on their business priorities and then expand with other solutions over time to maximize their return on investment.
In addition to the platform’s core components described above, brands can deploy a variety of business applications across three solution areas: Digital-First Engagement, Workforce Engagement, and Experience Management.
Digital-First Engagement
Our Digital-First Engagement applications help brands accelerate their digital strategy, including through: 
•Engagement Channels: Brands can digitally transform the customer experience across a wide number of channels, including messaging, social, chat, email, interactive voice response (IVR), and community.
•Conversational AI: With our intelligent virtual assistant (IVA), enable human-like conversations across every channel delivering effortless and personal experiences.
•Engagement Orchestration: Brands can improve employee efficiency, time to resolution, compliance, and customer satisfaction with workflows and automation that support simple customer channel interactions or complex orchestration of customer engagements across all channels, devices, and touchpoints. 
•Knowledge Management: Enable humans and bots to deliver stellar service with tools for accessing content across the organization, delivering consistent and compliant answers, and achieving compliance with regulations and processes. 
Workforce Engagement
Our Workforce Engagement applications help brands manage their customer engagement work and their workforce across the enterprise. From the contact center to the back office and branch, these applications enable brands to empower a workforce of humans and bots, enable connected work across all silos, and drive real-time work actions. We offer applications for the following:
•Forecasting & Scheduling: Understand the work needed to meet and exceed customer expectations, determine the optimal resourcing strategy to address customer expectations with a combination of employee input and automation, and provide staff across all customer touchpoints and across the enterprise with flexible scheduling options for balancing work and personal needs.
•Quality & Compliance: Use automation and workflows to make customer interactions across both attended and self-service voice and digital channels more pleasant, productive, and secure, while empowering employees with the skills they need to deliver outstanding performance.
•Interaction Insights: Extract insights from structured and unstructured customer interactions and activities across the enterprise to drive strategy, productivity, customer loyalty, and revenue.
•Real-Time Work: Support in-the-moment workforce activities with workflows, guidance, assistance, and automation to enhance customer experiences, workforce engagement, and compliance, while reducing operating costs.
Experience Management
Our Experience Management applications help brands collect and analyze customer experience data across all customer journeys - including direct, indirect, and inferred experiences - across digital, contact center, and location touchpoints. With a complete and unified view of the customer experience, brands are empowered with insights and actions to improve engagement from every level of the organization. Within this solution area, we offer applications for the following:
•Employee Experience: Help brands understand how employees are developing and where they may need coaching to improve. 
•Customer Experience: Understand the experience brands are delivering to their customers across channels, including voice and digital, and use that data to create a holistic, cross-channel view of customer experience at scale. 
Our Experience Management applications can be combined to provide solutions that solve experience management challenges throughout the enterprise, in the contact center, for digital teams, retail locations, marketing organizations and for human resources departments.
In addition to the Verint Cloud Platform, Verint continues to develop and enhance its Workforce Engagement (WFE) On-Premises Platform. Customers running the On-Premises Platform may also choose to keep their applications on-premises, while adding applications from the Verint Cloud Platform. They can also choose to convert to the Verint Cloud Platform when they are ready to move their applications to the cloud. We are committed to providing our customers with choice and flexibility when it comes to deploying solutions on-premises or in the cloud. We can help our customers evolve customer engagement at their own pace, while protecting their existing investments with minimal disruption to their operations.
Our Customers 
Our customer engagement solutions are used by approximately 10,000 organizations in over 175 countries across a diverse set of verticals, including financial services, healthcare, utilities, technology, and government. Our customers include large enterprises with thousands of employees, as well as SMB organizations. In the year ended January 31, 2022, we derived approximately 69%, 20%, and 11% of our revenue from sales to customers in the Americas, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, respectively. No end-customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue during the years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. In the year ended January 31, 2021, we had an authorized 
global reseller of our solutions that represented approximately 10% of our total revenue, but did not represent 10% or greater of our total revenue for the years ended January 31, 2022 or 2020.
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, potentially by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the later part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, also have an impact on our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of factors which may affect our business and financial results.
Direct and Indirect Sales
We sell our solutions through our direct sales teams and indirect channels. Our direct sales teams are focused on large and mid-sized customers and, in many cases, co-sell with our indirect channels. Our indirect channels also address large and midsize customers, as well as smaller customers. Our direct sales teams and indirect channels are supported by business consultants, solutions specialists, and presales engineers who, during the sales process, help determine customer requirements and develop technical responses to those requirements.
Customer Success
We help our customers achieve success and maximize their return on investment in our solutions through a range of services.
Cloud Operations. We deploy our cloud applications in multiple cloud environments, including the leading cloud infrastructure environments. We provide our customers with service-level commitments with respect to uptime and support.
Managed Services. We offer a range of managed services that are recurring in nature and can be delivered in conjunction with Verint’s technology or on a standalone basis, which help build strong relationships with our customers.
Implementation. Configurations, commissioning, integrations, and other implementation work can be performed by us, our authorized partners, or by end customers themselves. 
Training. Training programs are designed for customers and to certify our partners. Customer and partner training is provided at the customer site, at our training centers around the world, and/or remotely online.
Consulting. We and our partners offer customers help in maximizing the value of our solutions, including consulting on business strategy, process excellence, performance management, and project and program management.
Support. We offer a range of support plans to our customers and partners, designed to help ensure long-term successful use of our solutions. 
Research and Development 
We continue to enhance the features and performance of our existing solutions and introduce new solutions through extensive research and development (R&D) activities. Our R&D team, which is comprised of engineers, data scientists, PhDs and other technical experts, have deep software expertise, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, data aggregation and curation, machine learning, specialized language and vocabulary processing, and other key areas that support our strategic initiatives. In addition to the development of new solutions and the addition of capabilities to existing solutions, our R&D activities include cloud platform and shared service investment, quality assurance, and advanced technical support for our customer services organization. R&D is performed primarily in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Indonesia.
To support our research and development efforts, we make significant investments in R&D every year. We have a well-defined roadmap to introduce new features and functionality that we believe will further enhance the value of our solutions to our customers. We allocate our R&D resources in response to market research and customer demand for additional features and solutions. Our development strategy involves rolling out initial releases of our products and cloud services and adding features over time. We consider feedback received from our customers as part of our product development process. While the majority of our products are developed internally, in some cases, we also acquire or license technologies, products, and applications from third parties based on timing and cost considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” in Item 1A of this report.
Third-Party Suppliers 
For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of risks associated with our suppliers.
Human Capital
At Verint, we are committed to conducting our business in an ethical manner and to creating value for all of our stakeholders: customers and partners, employees and shareholders, the communities in which we work, and the global community at large. 
As of January 31, 2022, we employed approximately 4,400 professionals, including certain contractors, with approximately 45%, 34%, and 21% of our employees and contractors located in the Americas, EMEA (including Israel), and APAC, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. The market for talent in our industry is highly competitive. See Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the human capital risks we face.
Our employees in the United States are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. In some cases, our employees outside the United States are automatically subject to certain protections negotiated by organized labor in those countries directly with the government or trade unions, or are automatically entitled to severance or other benefits mandated under local laws.
Culture and Values
Verint is built on five core values that shape the way we do business with our customers, our partners, and each other. They express the company we want Verint to be — from the people we hire to the way we design our solutions — and they guide us in the decisions we make every day. Our five core values are:
•The integrity to do what’s right
•The innovation to create leading solutions for real-world challenges
•The transparency that fuels mutual trust and productive, collaborative working relationships
•The humility to view our successes as milestones in our journey, and our mistakes as opportunities for improvement
•A passion for making our customers and partners successful
These values embody the spirit of Verint and form the foundation for our objectives of superior solutions, unparalleled service, and an unwavering commitment to customer success.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We embrace differences and work to cultivate an inclusive organization. We believe in providing a supportive environment and opportunities for all of our employees to develop and advance. We support diverse groups in the workplace, with equal terms of employment, professional opportunities, and benefits. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer - we have affirmative action plans in place to help ensure that qualified applicants and employees are receiving an equal opportunity for recruitment, selection, and advancement. We offer our employees competitive compensation and benefits packages, with many company-paid offerings, including paid time off, tuition reimbursement, paid training and wellness programs, to support our recruiting and retention goals. We recognize differences in family composition and our U.S. benefit plans provide options for employees in diverse family circumstances including domestic partner benefits, adoption assistance, and fertility assistance. 
We track and periodically report on our global diversity results to our board of directors. For the year ended January 31, 2022, our female gender composition increased on a global basis and our minority employee composition increased across the U.S. We also increased the number of women within our senior leadership team (vice president and above) over the prior year. We intend to continue to focus on expanding diversity and inclusion as an intrinsic part of our business objectives, including through recruitment and promotional opportunities.
We have established a Diversity & Inclusion Council. The Council’s mandate is to help us foster an environment that attracts and retains the best talent, values diversity of life experiences and perspectives, educates our personnel, and encourages innovation. The Diversity & Inclusion Council currently has several initiatives underway, including partnering with non-profit organizations for talent acquisition and community outreach, and an educational series for Verint employees. The Diversity & Inclusion Council has also implemented a direct deposit program for employees to participate in charitable giving to two organizations: Black Girls Code, an organization that encourages and supports the aspirations of young women of color to code, engineer, and achieve careers in computer science and other STEM fields, and the Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network (GLSEN), an organization that tries to ensure every member of every school community is valued and respected regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. The Diversity & Inclusion Council increases cultural and diversity awareness within our organization and encourages employees to continue to drive outreach opportunities through employee and recruiting events.
We also encourage socially responsible procurement practices by actively pursuing business relationships with suppliers owned by minorities or by women.
Community Outreach
At Verint, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which we live and work. In 2005, we launched the Verint Next-Generation Program, which engages Verint employees around the globe in projects that benefit children in need. The program puts our core values to work in our local communities, with the goal of affording the next generation greater opportunities and the tools for making the most of them. As part of the program, Verint employees engage in various community activities, from supplying food pantries, to participating in blood drives, to collecting clothing and school supplies, to building playgrounds, to cleaning parks and planting gardens. Verint is also proud to support our employees’ community service activities with programs for donating employee time to qualified children’s organizations and matching grants. In 2021, Verint employees donated over $525,000 to children’s charities through the program. Globally, over 1,600 Verint employees supported more than 125 local non-profit organizations in local Verint communities. In 2021, we also focused on supporting events to help families struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic by providing food and clothing to those in need.
Employee Development
At Verint, we are dedicated to providing a productive, ethical, and safe working environment in which innovation and market leadership can flourish. We recognize that our employees are the driving force behind Verint’s success. Our fast-paced, challenging, and collaborative work environment nurtures professional growth and offers a wide array of career advancement opportunities, and our workforce planning tools provide managers with a framework for thinking strategically about the talent our company requires to achieve our business goals.
Continuous learning and the professional development of our employees are key factors in our success. Verint’s approach is based on the learning philosophy of “70:20:10”. We believe that seventy percent of skill development occurs through on-the-job experiences, twenty percent through colleague and leadership interactions, and ten percent through formal professional and academic learning opportunities. All our employees are afforded the opportunity to take part in our training programs, with the ability to focus their learning on the skills and knowledge that are most relevant for their professional development. We offer thousands of training courses in our online Learning Center in addition to classroom training. Throughout the pandemic, we have encouraged our employees to continue their professional development and acquisition of knowledge and skills, through existing and newly developed online learning.
Employees are also invited to establish an Individual Development Plan in collaboration with their managers to establish and facilitate the employee’s short- and long-term development goals. These plans are tailored to the employee’s own individual competencies and aspirations in the context of our business goals and available opportunities.
Please see the Diversity and Inclusion section of our website and our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website for further information on our ESG initiatives, including with respect to 
human capital. These resources and the information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC.
Competition 
We face strong competition from many vendors, some of whom focus on customer engagement and some of whom offer customer engagement-related capabilities. Key competitors include Alvaria, Inc., Calabrio, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, Medallia Inc., NICE Ltd., Pegasystems Inc., divisions of larger companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and Salesforce.com, Inc., as well as many smaller companies, which vary from region to region globally.
We believe that we compete principally on the basis of:
•Product performance and functionality;
•Product quality and reliability;
•Breadth of product portfolio and pre-defined integrations;
•Global presence, reputation, and high-quality customer service and support;
•Specific domain expertise, industry knowledge, vision, and experience; and 
•Price.
We believe that our competitive success depends primarily on our ability to provide technologically advanced and cost-effective solutions and services. Some of our competitors have superior brand recognition and significantly greater financial or other resources than we do. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets or we enter theirs, and as new products, services, technologies, and delivery methods are introduced. In addition, consolidation is common in our markets and has in the past and may in the future improve the position of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—Intense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources or the ability to move faster than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Intellectual Property Rights 
General
Our success depends to a significant degree on the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Patents
As of January 31, 2022, we had more than 650 patents and patent applications worldwide across areas including data capture, artificial intelligence, machine learning, unstructured data analytics, predictive analytics, and automation. We regularly review new areas of technology related to our businesses to determine whether they can and should be patented.
Licenses
Our customer and partner license agreements prohibit the unauthorized use, copying, and disclosure of our software technology and contain customer restrictions and confidentiality terms. These agreements generally warrant that the software and proprietary hardware will materially comply with written documentation and assert that we own or have sufficient rights in the software we distribute and have not violated the intellectual property rights of others. We generally make our solutions available through our cloud platform or license them in a format that does not permit users to change the software code.
While we employ many of our innovations exclusively in our own products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based on industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” in Item 1A of this report.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We use various trademarks and service marks to protect the marks used in our business. We also claim common law protections for other marks we use in our business. 
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Information/Product Security and Intellectual Property—Our products or other IP may infringe or may be alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions for us and may require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for any damages they suffer” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion regarding the risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property.
Regulatory Matters
Our business and operations are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate or in which we offer our solutions, including, among other things, with respect to data privacy and protection, government contracts, anti-corruption, trade compliance, tax, and labor matters. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality—We are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could negatively impact us or our business, and —Increasing regulatory focus on data privacy issues and expanding laws in these areas may result in increased compliance costs, impact our business models, and expose us to increased liability” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the regulatory risks we face.
