ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a blank check company incorporated on June 18, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our “initial business combination”. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and the private placement of the private warrants (as defined below), the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to any forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing.



On July 19, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 15,000,000 units (the “units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (“common stock”), one right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination, and one-half of one warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. On July 28, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full and purchased an additional 2,250,000 private warrants, generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000, for an aggregate total of $172,500,000 in gross proceeds from the IPO and closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option.



Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (the “private placement”) with initial stockholders of the Company of 6,500,000 warrants (the “private warrants”), generating total proceeds of $6,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of 675,000 private warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant in a private placement, generating gross proceeds of $675,000, for an aggregate total of $7,175,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of the private warrants. The private warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the public Units in the IPO except that the private warrants will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, as further described in the Registration Statement. Such initial purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the private warrants.



Following the closing of the IPO and the over-allotment, an amount of $174,500,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of our initial business combination and (ii) our failure to consummate a business combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination) of the closing of the IPO.



As of December 31, 2021, there was $174,230,428 in investments held in the trust account, which includes interest income available to us for franchise and income tax obligations of $0 and $0 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2021, we have not withdrawn any interest earned from the trust account to pay taxes.



Recent Developments



Merger Agreement



On December 16, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, the “Merger Agreement,” and together with the other agreements and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”) with CleanTech Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanTech (“Merger Sub”), and Nauticus Robotics, Inc., a Texas corporation (“Nauticus”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between CleanTech and Nauticus will be effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Nauticus, with Nauticus surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CleanTech (the “Merger”). The Board of Directors of CleanTech (the “Board”) has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by the stockholders of CleanTech.

Treatment of Nauticus Securities



Preferred Stock. Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”) and subject to the consent of the holders of Nauticus’ preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Nauticus Preferred Stock”), each issued and outstanding share of Nauticus Preferred Stock shall be converted into shares of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Nauticus (the “Nauticus Robotics Common Stock”) in accordance with the Nauticus Certificate of Incorporation (collectively, the “Nauticus Preferred Stock Conversion”). All of the shares of Nauticus Preferred Stock converted into shares of Nauticus Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Nauticus Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.
Convertible Notes. Immediately prior to Nauticus Preferred Stock Conversion and prior to the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding convertible promissory note of Nauticus (the “Nauticus Convertible Notes”) will be automatically converted into shares of Nauticus Common Stock in accordance with the terms of such Converting Convertible Note (collectively, the “Nauticus Convertible Note Conversion”). Each Converting Convertible Note converted into shares of Nauticus Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Converting Convertible Note shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities.
Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Nauticus Stockholder, subject to and in consideration of the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of Nauticus Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Merger Agreement)), shall be converted into the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration and the Earnout Shares (as defined below). All of the shares of Nauticus Common Stock converted into the right to receive consideration shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Nauticus Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the applicable consideration into which such share of Nauticus Common Stock shall have been converted into in the Merger.
Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of the Nauticus Common Stock (a “Nauticus Option”) granted under any Nauticus Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by CleanTech and shall be converted into a stock option (a “CleanTech Option”) to acquire shares of CleanTech’s Common Stock in accordance with the Merger Agreement. As of the Effective Time, each such CleanTech Option as so assumed and converted shall be for that number of shares of CleanTech’s Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Nauticus Common Stock subject to such Nauticus Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement), which product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, at a per share exercise price determined by dividing the per share exercise price of such Nauticus Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio.



Earn-Out Shares. Following the closing of the merger, former holders of shares of Nauticus Common Stock (including shares received as a result of the Nauticus Preferred Stock conversion and the Nauticus Convertible Notes conversion) and, former holders of Nauticus stock options, shall each be entitled to receive their pro rata share of up to 7,500,000 additional shares of CleanTech Common Stock (the “Earn-Out Shares”) if, within a 5-year period following the signing date of the Merger Agreement, the closing share price of the CleanTech Common Stock equals or exceeds any of three thresholds over any 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period (each, a “Triggering Event”) and, in respect of a former holder of Nauticus stock options, the holder continues to provide services to CleanTech or one of its subsidiaries at the time of such Triggering Event.

The obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement. In connection with the Closing, Nauticus, CleanTech and certain stockholders of each of Nauticus and CleanTech who will receive shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement mutually agreeable to CleanTech and Nauticus, which will become effective upon the consummation of the Merger.
Lock-up Agreement and Arrangements. In connection with the Closing, the Sponsors and certain Nauticus stockholders will enter into a lock-up agreement (the “Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement” and “Company Stockholder Lock-up Agreement) with Nauticus and CleanTech, pursuant to which each will agree, subject to certain customary exceptions, not to:



(i) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of common stock received as merger consideration and held by it immediately after the Effective Time (the “Lock-Up Shares”), or enter into a transaction that would have the same effect;



(ii) enter into transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of such shares, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of such shares, in cash or otherwise; or



(iii) publicly disclose the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, or engage in any “Short Sales” (as defined in the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement and Company Stockholder Lock-up Agreement) with respect to any security of CleanTech; during a “Lock-Up Period” under their respective agreements.

Business Strategy



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, our business strategy is to identify and acquire a rapidly growing operating company on the cutting edge of the CleanTech or ClimateTech sectors. Our management team, along with our board of directors and advisers will bring unique, attractive opportunities for us to analyze and ultimately acquire. Once selected, we will leverage our team’s vast experience to help said company grow and achieve additional unrealized value for stockholders. The climate problem requires mobilization of both private and public sectors, and our team’s varied experience in the public, governmental, private, and corporate sectors gives us an ideal combination and balance of perspectives, resources, and expertise.
Acquisition Criteria



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are critical to evaluating prospective companies within our targeted sub-sector:

● | Disruptive mission driven technology companies in the CleanTech and ClimateTech sectors positioned to capitalize on changing macroeconomic forces.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





4








● | Strong business case for high growth and high impact;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Sustainable competitive advantages including a strong intellectual property portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunities for growth, organically or through follow-on acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Positioned to benefit from our team’s deep network and subject matter expertise;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Best in class management team with a unique vision;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | A robust existing investor base who are aligned with management on the long-term goals and vision of the company
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to benefit from access to the public markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------




Notwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may or may not be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, benchmarks and guidelines that our management may deem relevant.



Our Acquisition Process



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, our team’s network will give us exclusive access to a strong pipeline of opportunities in the cleantech sector.



Our acquisition process will involve an extensive due diligence, valuation and analysis which will consist of multiple discussions with current management, financial projection reviews, review of the prospective targets’ intellectual property portfolio among other items. The process will consist of financial and operational due diligence, on site walkthroughs and a full legal diligence. We will retain third-party advisors as necessary to advise us during the due diligence process as well.



Our evaluation will focus on finding mission driven CleanTech and ClimateTech companies with strong market positions poised to capitalize on changing macroeconomic forces. We will look for a business with a strong intellectual property portfolio or a significant competitive advantage in its sector either through brand recognition or a meaningful first mover advantage.



The final step of our acquisition process will be approval by our board of directors. Our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent directors and each of whom has considerable experience and expertise in the sector, will review the proposed combination and reach a decision on its merits consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities to the stockholders.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, co-sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, co-sponsor or any of our officers or directors, we, or a committee of our independent directors, if required by applicable law or based upon the decision of our board of directors or a committee thereof, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to us from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or an independent accounting firm.



Our co-sponsors, directors and members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our founder shares, common stock and/or private placement warrants, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.





5







Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she then has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers and directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.



In addition, our co-sponsors, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our co-sponsors, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved.



Initial Business Combination



Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our co-sponsors and board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our co-sponsor or board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we may obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm as to the fair market value of the target business. Each business combination will be approved by our co-sponsors and a majority of our independent directors.



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, we anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the “Investment Company Act.” Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction.



If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private warrants, our shares, new debt, or a combination of these, as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.



If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.





6







Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, this assessment may not result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.



Sources of Target Businesses



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity groups, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources also may introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, also may bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee may be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. Although some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the acquired business following our initial business combination, the presence or absence of any such arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an acquisition candidate.



We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. In any case, we will only consummate an initial business combination in which we become the majority shareholder of the target (or control the target through contractual arrangements in limited circumstances for regulatory compliance purposes as discussed below) or are otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, or to the extent permitted by law we may acquire interests in a variable interest entity, in which we may have less than a majority of the voting rights in such entity, but in which we are the primary beneficiary. There is no basis for investors in the IPO to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. We will not pay any finders or consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business or Businesses



The target business or businesses or assets with which we effect our initial business combination must have a collective fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. If we acquire less than 100% of one or more target businesses in our initial business combination, the aggregate fair market value of the portion or portions we acquire must equal at least 80% of the value of the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination. However, we will always acquire at least a controlling interest in a target business. The fair market value of a portion of a target business or assets will likely be calculated by multiplying the fair market value of the entire business by the percentage of the target we acquire. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with an initial target business or businesses with a collective fair market value in excess of the balance in the trust account. In order to consummate such an initial business combination, we may issue a significant amount of debt, equity or other securities to the sellers of such business and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt, equity or other securities. If we issue securities in order to consummate such an initial business combination, our stockholders could end up owning a minority of the combined company’s voting securities as there is no requirement that our stockholders own a certain percentage of our company (or, depending on the structure of the initial business combination, an ultimate parent company that may be formed) after our business combination. Because we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such arrangement to issue our debt or equity securities and have no current intention of doing so.



The fair market value of a target business or businesses or assets will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential gross margins, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, book value, enterprise value and, where appropriate, upon the advice of appraisers or other professional consultants. Investors will be relying on the business judgment of our board of directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of a particular target business. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine that the target business or assets has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless we consummate a business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we seek to acquire, that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders.





8







Lack of Business Diversification



For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team



Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. The future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. Consequently, members of our management team may not become a part of the target’s management team, and the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Further, it is also not certain whether one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination. Moreover, members of our management team may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. Our key personnel may not remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.



Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or to ascertain that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account.



In order for a public stockholder to have his, her or its shares redeemed for cash in connection with any proposed business combination, we may require that the public stockholders vote either in favor of or against a proposed business combination. If required to vote pursuant to the procedures specified in our proxy statement to stockholders relating to the business combination, and a public stockholder fails to vote in favor of or against the proposed business combination, whether that stockholder abstains from the vote or simply does not vote, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed to cash in connection with such business combination.





9









If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we so choose and are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we are not subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us), and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait 12 months (or up to 18 months, as applicable) from the closing of the IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our initial stockholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought stockholder approval of a proposed transaction, we would need only (i) 937,501 of our public shares (or approximately 6.25% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming that only a quorum was present at the meeting, that the over-allotment option is not exercised and that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in the IPO or units or shares in the after-market), or (ii) 5,625,001 of our public shares (or approximately 37.5% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming that all outstanding shares were present at the meeting, that the over-allotment option is not exercised and that the initial stockholders do not purchase any units in the IPO or units or shares in the after-market).



If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Conversion/Tender Rights



In connection with any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. A public stockholder may be required to vote for or against a proposed business combination in order to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed for cash. If required to do so, and the stockholder fails to vote for or against a proposed business combination, that stockholder would not be able to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial stockholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his, her or its shares.





10







Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public stockholder will be provided the opportunity to sell its public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.



Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the IPO or purchased by them in the IPO or in the aftermarket.



We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if the holder wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares of common stock into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to. The conversion rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.



There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45, and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any request to convert or tender such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination



If we do not complete a business combination within 12 months from the closing of the IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, our initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate an initial business combination 2 times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 18 months to complete an initial business combination) without the need for a separate stockholder vote. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination without the need for a separate stockholder vote is for our initial stockholders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,725,000 ($0.10 per public share, or an aggregate of $3,450,000 if extended for each of the full three months), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement, if such funds are not deposited, the time to complete an initial business combination cannot be extended unless our stockholders otherwise approve an extension on different terms. In the event that they elected to extend the time to complete our initial business combination and deposited the applicable amount of money into trust, the initial stockholders would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such note would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the time period.

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any redemptions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a redemption is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 15th month (or up to the 18th month, as applicable) from the closing of the IPO and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the above procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to seeking to complete an initial business combination, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.



We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after the IPO) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. The underwriters in the IPO will execute such a waiver agreement.



As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party refuses to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, or whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver, or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if third parties execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Certain of our insiders have agreed that they will be jointly and severally liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below $10.10 per public share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Our board of directors has evaluated such insiders’ financial net worth and believes they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that may arise. However, these insiders may not be able to satisfy their indemnification obligations, as we have not required them to retain any assets to provide for their indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that they will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Moreover, these insiders will not be liable to our public stockholders, and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than the estimated $10.10 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us, subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors.





12







If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date, and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate the redemption of our public shares. Our insiders have waived their rights to participate in any redemption with respect to their insider shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $50,000), and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. Each holder of public shares will receive a pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.



Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per share redemption or conversion amount received by public stockholders may be less than $10.10.



If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons.



Our certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the IPO that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we hold a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder’s rights or pre-business combination activity (including the substance or timing within which we have to complete a business combination), we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in connection with any such vote. Our insiders have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any insider shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:




● | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to convert their shares of common stock, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into a portion of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, in each case subject to the limitations described herein;

13








● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if public stockholders do not exercise conversion rights in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 12 months (or up to 18 months, as applicable) of the closing of the IPO, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account to all of our public holders of shares of common stock; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



If the Business Combination with Nauticus does not close, in identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Facilities



We pay Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, an affiliate of CleanTech Investments, a fee of $10,000 per month for use of office space and certain office and secretarial services. The office space is located at 207 West 25th Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10001.
Employees



We currently have 4 executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
