Item 1. Business
Corporate Information



Logiq, Inc., formerly known as Weyland Tech, Inc., is a Delaware corporation that incorporated in 2004. Logiq is headquartered in New York, with offices in New York City, Singapore, Minneapolis, MN and Jakarta, Indonesia.



On September 25, 2020, the Company commenced trading under the Company’s new name, Logiq, Inc., under its new symbol: “LGIQ”. The Company’s common stock is quoted on the OTCQX Market.



On December 15, 2021, we entered into various agreements with Lovarra, a Nevada corporation (“Lovarra”) and public reporting subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer its AppLogiq business to Lovarra, subject to customary conditions and approvals and completion of requisite financial statement audits (the “Separation”). Lovarra is a fully reporting U.S. public company, which is approximately 78.5% owned by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary GoLogiq LLC (“GoLogiq”). In connection with the Separation, the Company intends to distribute, on a pro rata basis, 100% of the Company’s ownership interests in Lovarra to the Company’s shareholders of record as of December 30, 2021 (the “Record Date”) (the “Distribution,” and collectively with the “Separation,” the “Spin Off”), which Distribution of said shares is expected to occur six months from completion of the Separation (the “Distribution Date”).



On January 27, 2022, we completed the transfer of our AppLogiq business to Lovarra. In connection with the completion of the transfer of AppLogiq to Lovarra, Lovarra issued 26,350,756 shares of its common stock to the Company (the “Lovarra Shares”). The Company will hold the Lovarra Shares until it distributes 100% of the Lovarra Shares to the Company’s stockholders of record as of December 30, 2021 on a 1-for-1 basis (i.e. for every 1 share of Logiq held on December 30, 2021, the holder thereof will receive 1 share of Lovarra), which the Company intends to complete approximately 6 months from now, subject to customary conditions and approvals.



Until such time as the Distribution is complete, we will consolidate and report the financials of the AppLogiq business as a consolidated subsidiary of Logiq.

Products



General



Since 2017, we have been focused on enabling mobile commerce via our enhanced platform offered on a PaaS basis, and the Company’s e-wallet initiative. Product launches with our strategic partners DPEX Worldwide Express (S) PTE. Ltd. (Indonesia), BGT Corp Public Company Limited (Thailand), and Augicom Telecom SA (France) are representative of the PaaS platform strategy and product offering. As of the date of this Annual Report, we offer the following products (each of which is described below): (i) APPLogiq, (ii) PAYLogiq, (iii) GOLogiq; and (iv) the DATALogiq branded consumer data management platform.



AppLogiq



APPLogiq, the Company’s core product and PaaS, allows SMBs to create mobile apps for their business without the need of technical knowledge, high investment, or background in IT.



APPLogiq has evolved over the course of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to capitalize on the immediate opportunity for developing a larger network of valuable users and merchants by developing services that will enable the adoption of mobile commerce across Greater South East Asia and the United States. The platform enhancements have taken the Company’s technology from a standalone “do-it-yourself” (“DIY”) app builder to an enhanced platform built to enable mobile commerce by empowering users to create their own e-commerce and mobile-commerce ecosystem.



In 2019, the Company focused on scaling this business model by continuing to develop and expand strategic partnerships that would increase the number of users, and the merchants available to users, of the Company’s products on a PaaS basis. These efforts expanded on the success of recent product launches representative of the PaaS platform strategy and product offerings with our strategic partners, and after extensive discussions with our partners, management believes that supporting these initiatives through deeper engagement, interaction, and co-marketing/sales substantially benefited the Company in 2018 and 2019. As a result, our year-over-year revenues increased by 45% in 2018 and by 52% in 2019. For 2020 over 2019, in spite of COVID-19, the Company worked to improve gross profit margins while reducing older, white-label partnership revenues and although year-over-year revenues decreased by 34%, the gross profits margins improved to approximately 25.8% due to a loss of customers as a result of adverse effects of the on-set of Covid-19 in March 2020 and the provision of complimentary services in an effort to retain customers.



In 2020 and 2021, we have revamped Version 4 of our CreateApp platform with the following added functionalities: E-Store Multiple Product Variations & Options, Food-Ordering Self Pickup & Delivery options, Google Maps Autocomplete Address Integration, Google Fonts Integration, Dynamic Global Font Size, Line Integration, Lazy Load & Shimmer Effect Implementation and a customer focused Support Service Desk Widget dashboard.



We are planning to introduce a data warehousing project. This project will enhance browsing speed by reconstruct & restructure our platform to handle big data in chunks dynamically. We plan to implement SPA (Single Page Applications) to rewrite the pages dynamically to the current web page with new data from the webserver instead of loading entire new pages. We also process the data and store it as an object array in the server's memory for faster data fetching. The overall browsing experience will feel more like a native app.



PayLogiq



Launched in late 2017 as the Company’s e-wallet initiative, PAYLogiq is a ‘consumer facing’ product offering that supports the PaaS strategy developed by the enhancements to the AppLogiq platform providing payment capabilities to users of our platform. Moreover, PAYLogiq is designed to be a robust and universal payment platform, and its growth is therefore not limited to the Company’s PaaS customers alone.



Since its launch, PAYLogiq has surpassed the Company’s expectations as it has achieved stronger than anticipated customer traction with limited marketing expense. In 2020, PAYLogiq’s total gross mobile transaction volume totaled $16.4 million.



GOLogiq



GOLogiq is our PaaS platform that provides mobile payment capabilities for the local food delivery service industry. We launched GOLogiq in the fall of 2019 in Jakarta, Indonesia, and as of December 31, 2020, GOLogiq has reached a registered customer base of 166,000 mobile users. The Company plans to continue to reinvest in GOLogiq in order to increase user growth and regional expansion with its unique pedestrian-powered approach to urban food delivery.

DATALogiq Consumer Data Management Platform



DATALogiq operates a consumer data management platform powered by lead generation, online marketing, and multichannel reengagement strategies through its owned and operated brands.



DATALogiq has developed a proprietary data management platform and integrates with several third-party service providers to optimize the return on its marketing efforts. DATALogiq focuses on consumer engagement and data enrichment to maximize its return on acquisition through repeat monetization of each consumer. DATALogiq also licenses its software technology and provides managed technology services to various other e-commerce companies. DATALogiq is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.
Product Development



DATALogiq is developing an end-to-end marketing technology platform utilizing big data and artificial intelligence (“AI”) for enterprise and SMB clients that will allow clients to develop desired target audiences, activate campaigns, insert creative content and broadcast through a cost-effective advertising channel for the campaign.



Development of our software is focused on expanding product lines, designing enhancements to our core technologies, and integrating existing and new products into our principal software architecture and platform technologies. We intend to continue to offer regular updates to our products and to continue to look for opportunities to expand our existing suite of products and services.



To date, we have primarily developed products internally, sometimes also licensing or acquiring products, or portions of products, from third parties. These arrangements sometimes require that we pay royalties to third parties. We intend to continue to license or otherwise acquire technology or products from third parties when it makes business sense to do so.



In the third quarter of 2020, we rebranded under the Logiq name. Our offerings now extend from mobile commerce and fintech solutions for SMBs, to AI-powered, SaaS-based digital marketing solutions for enterprises and major brands. We believe the Logiq branding better reflects the use of data analytics that underlies both of our business segments.



Our customer relationships now range from hundreds of thousands of SMBs around the world to publicly traded Fortune 1000 companies. Among our notable customers are QuinStreet (a marketing technology company), Purple (the creator of the renowned Purple mattress) and Sunrun (a solar company).



These new major clients reflect our transformation, which began with the completion of our acquisition of the assets of Push. This has led to the streamlining during the third quarter of 2020 of our various brands and business units into two business segments: DataLogiq and AppLogiq.



DATALogiq’s data engine uses proprietary methodologies and AI systems to deliver valuable consumer insights that can dramatically enhance the effectiveness, reach, and return on investment of online marketing spend for enterprises and major brands. Alongside DataLogiq is our new Fixel subsidiary that offers simplified online marketing with critical privacy features.



Our APPLogiq mobile commerce PaaS enables SMBs worldwide to easily create and deploy a native mobile app for their business without technical knowledge or background. APPLogiq empowers businesses to reach more customers, increase sales, manage logistics, and promote their products and services in an easy and affordable way. Our APPLogiq mobile platform now also includes our PAYLogiq fintech and GOLogiq delivery services that have garnered great interest from potential partners due to the deep consumer data both have been acquiring since their inception.



The combination of APPLogiq’s mobile platform and DATALogiq’s data engines offers a uniquely powerful e-commerce and m-commerce platform for many types of businesses and brands. We have and will continue to integrate, existing and new, cutting-edge services with the aim of providing a comprehensive and differentiated e-commerce and m-commerce offering for our existing and interested, new customers.



Soon after the close of the Push asset acquisition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly emerged, with global lockdowns and the corresponding impact on SMBs. Fortunately, due to the diversification of our revenue sources we have thus far been able to weather the storm. While our APPLogiq m-commerce business, targeted at distributors and SMB end users, has been adversely affected by the lockdown of traditional commercial businesses, our DATALogiq e-commerce data-driven digital marketing business has benefited by shifting to the many solely online businesses that have experienced an uptick in demand due to the pandemic.



Importantly, for DATALogiq, the recent acquisition of Fixel and its audience targeting solution has meant the introduction of a new SaaS revenue stream. Audience targeting is the ability to take the full audience of prospective customers and segment it into groups based on different criteria, including online behavioral characteristics, demographics, interests, and intent. The acquisition reflects our ability to adapt to the substantial industry shift that the end of the third party cookies represents. Fixel provides a timely solution to the loss of third party data that addresses the consumer privacy concerns that gave rise to the coming decline in third party cookies.

Our Competitive Strength



Logiq has an AI-driven, first party data, privacy compliant targeting solution that does not rely on third party cookie solutions. Our proprietary technology does not use any personally identifiable information or third party cookie information. Rather, it relies only on first party data collected on an advertiser’s or publisher’s website. The AI engine has the unique ability to determine the “most engaged visitors” to a website and then use that information to target them on Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, LinkedIn, TradeDesk and other major platforms. At the heart of our data solution lies the value – the AI engine that analyzes and makes judgements about all visitors to a site.



By segmenting site visitors into Baseline, Medium and High categories, these designations can be leveraged when creating campaigns on any of these destinations. These segments are touted to give our customers the best insight into who are the most engaged audiences in the 90 to 95% of site visitors who don’t convert.



Across advertisers, publishers, agencies and tech platforms (such as demand side platforms that allow buyers of digital advertising inventory to manage multiple advertising exchange and data exchange accounts through one interface), the Logiq solution is viewed by existing customers (through their feedback to Logiq) to be a solution that can gain rapid adoption, as the industry trend is one where ecosystem constituents look to move away from their current third party cookie targeting initiatives. Our solution is not only for advertising purposes but could also be applied to a marketer’s analytics stack to gain deeper insights and understanding of their visitors’ behavior.



Today, Logiq uses its proprietary advertising and marketing technology platform to provide direct-to-consumer marketing services to advertisers. Our technology platform has proven to find in-market audiences and convert them to paying customers. Today, our technology is being used by enterprise brands such as Purple Mattress, Sunrun, and QuinStreet. A key next phase of the Company is to go downstream to small to medium size e-commerce agencies and brands by providing a new kind of marketing solution that delivers enterprise level capabilities via a simplified, do-it-yourself, automated platform.



Our Strategy



Our growth strategy is a multi-pronged approach, consisting of the following:




● | Development of an end-to-end unified SaaS offering. We expect to unify all of our technology platforms into one framework to provide a streamlined user experience for customers to leverage all of our applications through a SaaS model.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our customer base and business relationships. Today, we are already installed in major media companies and technology platforms. We intend to increase the usage of our technology and deepen technology relationships to drive increased revenue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand salesforce to acquire new brands and online advertisers. We intend to increase our salesforce to expand our existing business relationships with leading media networks and advertising agencies and to aggressively activate new brand advertiser relationships and business joint ventures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus on SMBs. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for an end-to-end advertising and marketing technology solution for SMBs seeking to grow their online sales without dealing with the many challenges of integrating multiple point solutions. We intend to heavily market our platforms to SMBs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain innovation. We continue to develop and introduce new features and improved functionality to our platforms. Key initiatives include development of easy to use self serve platforms for SMBs, and continued development of AI-driven marketing technologies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing



Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on promoting sales, producing expert content and brand awareness. The Company believes that our resellers agreements signed in 2015, 2016, and 2017 created a large enough addressable market opportunity to generate sales and profits in a scalable manner, grow the Company’s business and enhance shareholder value. Given the nature of DIY mobile apps and the primary target market of SMBs, a typical go-to-market strategy would have a direct sales force or resellers approach SMBs directly to drive our revenue.





4








The Company has further evolved our PaaS platform with two distinct market paths to drive recurring revenue business model:



A) Cooperation agreements in countries/regions where our partners are responsible for targeting SMBs either through an installed base of customers or groups of direct sellers with a sales and marketing team focusing on end customers. The 2020 partnership with KMSB is representative of this revised path.



B) Digital wallet or e-wallet solutions. A distinguishing characteristic of Greater South East Asia (“GSEA”) compared to the United States is the substantially lower percentage of the population in GSEA with bank accounts, credit cards, or debit cards. This creates the need for alternative payment methods, specifically e-wallets according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). GSEA is poised for its own payments transformation in much the same way that China has shifted to online payments. Online payments in GSEA is divided into four broad payment modes: e-wallets (such as our PayLogiq platform), credit cards, debit cards and online banking. Of these IDC experts, the e-wallet mode is expected to grow the fastest over the next five years. Drivers for GSEA’s e-wallet industry include the mismatch between internet penetration and banking penetration (which creates a structural opportunity for e-wallet), the increasing integration of e-wallets with use cases such as online games and e-commerce, and the opportunity to offer broader digital financial services using e-wallets as a foundation.



With the above strategy, we believe that the Company will be able to maintain a lower capital expenditure base due to the ‘level-two’ customer support vs. ‘level-one’ customer support, smaller sales and marketing teams, and the need to provide hosting services.



The Company’s APPLogiq platform operates as a PaaS allowing users to develop their own applications supplying the infrastructure and IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web or desktop browser. The Company recognizes revenue on a pay to use subscription basis when our customers use our platform.



We do not compensate resellers and distributors. Instead, the end user pays the reseller/distributor directly as well as paying for our services, for which we or our reseller/distributor in licensed territories bill the end user separately.



Markets, Geography, and Seasonality



Our products and services are predominantly sold in North America and the Southeast Asian markets. Based on our current and historical balance sheets and statement of operations, it does not appear that our business or operations experience any seasonality with respect to our sales as any such seasonality appears to be unpredictable. Although we believe our customers’ historical buying patterns and budgetary cycles may be a factor that impacts our quarterly sales results, we are not able to reliably predict our sales based on seasonality because outside factors (timing, introduction of new products and services, and other economic factors impacting our industry) can also substantially impact our revenues during the year.
Major Customers



No single customer represented significant concentration risk during 2021 APPLogiq’s continued shift in focus away from bulk white label distributors to direct marketing end users. 



For the DATALogiq business segment in the year ended December 31, 2021, there is no significant customer concentration risk based on our total consolidated revenues.  



Research and Development



Our R&D strategy is to offer cutting edge financial, marketing, and advertising technology to the Company’s present and future customers. The Company continues to invest in website, e-commerce platform and mobile app development. In addition, the Company continues to develop its system support knowledge base and other internal systems.



The Company’s commercial and corporate-strategy functions collaborate closely with the R&D team on the Company’s priorities. The R&D strategy determines what capabilities and technologies the Company must have in place to bring the desired solutions to market. R&D capabilities are the technical abilities to discover, develop, or scale marketable solutions. Capabilities are unlocked by a combination of technologies and assets, and focus on the outcomes.  The choices of operating model and organizational design will ultimately determine how well the R&D strategy is executed.



Competition



Our business is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our current and potential competitors include: (i) advertising companies, web design firms and, more recently, mobile app makers; (ii) other DIY mobile app companies; (iii) a number of indirect competitors, including media companies, web portals, comparison shopping websites, and web search engines, either directly or in collaboration with SMBs; (iv) companies that provide e-commerce and e-wallet services, including website/app development; and (v) companies that provide infrastructure web and mobile services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our mobile apps business include ease of use, affordability and broad range of functionality. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and greater brand recognition. They may adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology, functionality and ease of use and marketing. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

E-commerce



We face competition principally from regional players that operate across several markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. We also face competition from single-market players in those regions. We compete to attract, engage and retain buyers based on the variety and value of products and services listed on our marketplaces, overall user experience and convenience, online communication tools, integration with mobile and networking applications and tools, quality of mobile applications, and availability of payment settlement and logistics services. We also compete to attract and retain sellers based on the number and engagement of buyers, the effectiveness and value of the marketing services we offer, commission rates and the usefulness of the services we provide including data and analytics for potential buyer targeting, cloud computing services and the availability of support services, including payment settlement and logistics services.
E-wallet Platforms



PAYLogiq competes primarily with credit card and debit card service providers, banks with payment processing offerings, other offline payment options and other electronic payment system operators. PAYLogiq competes with these companies primarily on the basis of transaction processing speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, reliability and price. We believe the combination of PAYLogiq’s numerous physical merchant locations and the PAYLogiq App is a significant competitive advantage because of the strong demand in GSEA for convenient forms of payment processing.
Intellectual Property



The Company has, under a software purchase agreement, the eWallet platform currently operating under the brand names AtozPay and AtozGo in Indonesia (PAYLogiq and GOLogiq respectively), and the global rights to market and operate in other countries worldwide.



In addition, the Company has acquired the rights to the following United States trademarks through its acquisition of the Push assets:




1. | United States Trademark “Astrology Nova” (Registration Number 5631852), registered under Push Holdings, Inc.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | United States Trademark “BlueDrone” (Registration Number 5528307), registered under Comiseo, Inc.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company is in the process of registering transfers of these trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office into the name of the Company.



The Company has three trademarks pending for registration in the United States for the word mark “Logiqx” under serial numbers 8885602, 88856050 and 88856033.



Employees



We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. 



The Company currently has thirty-seven full-time contracted personnel in Singapore, Myanmar, Hong Kong and the United States. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Government Approval



Because our core business is to provide a PaaS platform that allows SMBs to build their presence on mobile devices, we do not believe that any government agency approval is required for the products and services that we provide to our customers.
Government Regulations



We and our clients currently use pseudonymous data about Internet and mobile app users on our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to end users based on their geographic locations, the type of device they are using, their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activity, or their relationships with our clients. Such data is passed to us from third parties, including original equipment manufacturers, application providers, and publishers. We do not use this data to discover the identity of individuals, and we currently prohibit clients, data providers and inventory suppliers from importing data that directly identifies individuals onto our platform.

Our ability, like those of other advertising technology companies, to collect, augment, analyze, use and share data relies upon the ability to uniquely identify devices across websites and applications, and to collect data about user interactions with those devices for purposes such as serving relevant ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads. The processes used to identify devices and similar and associated technologies are governed by U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and dependent upon their implementation within the industry ecosystem. Such laws, regulations, and industry standards may change from time to time, including those relating to the level of consumer notice, consent and/or choice required when a company employs cookies or other electronic tools to collect data about interactions with users online.



In the U.S., both federal and state legislation govern activities such as the collection and use of data, and privacy in the advertising technology industry has frequently been subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), U.S. Congress, and individual states. Much of the federal oversight on digital advertising in the U.S. currently comes from the FTC, which has primarily relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in “unfair” or “deceptive” trade practices, including alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals’ privacy interests. However, there is increasing consumer concern over data privacy in recent years, which has led to a myriad of proposed legislation and new legislation both at the federal and state levels, some of which has affected and will continue to affect our operations and those of our industry partners. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020, defines “personal information” broadly enough to include online identifiers provided by individuals’ devices, applications, and protocols (such as IP addresses, mobile application identifiers and unique cookie identifiers) and individuals’ location data, if there is potential that individuals can be identified by such data.



The CCPA creates individual data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California (including rights to deletion of and access to personal information), imposes special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, creates new notice obligations and new limits on and rules regarding the “sale” of personal information (interpreted by many observers to include common advertising practices), and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CCPA also offers the possibility to a consumer to recover statutory damages for certain violations and could open the door more broadly to additional risks of individual and class-action lawsuits even though the statute’s private right of action is limited in scope. There have been many class action lawsuits filed invoking the CCPA outside of the private right of action provided for by the law. It is unclear at this point whether any of these claims will be accepted by the courts. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, recently passed, which will impose additional notice and opt out obligations on the digital advertising space, including an obligation to provide an opt out for behavioral advertising. When the CPRA goes into full effect in January 2023, it will impose additional restrictions on us and on our industry partners; it is difficult to predict with certainty the full effect of the CPRA and its implementing regulations on the industry.



As our business is global, our activities are also subject to foreign legislation and regulation. In the European Union (including the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) and the countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EU, separate laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) govern the processing of personal data, and these laws and regulations continue to impact us. The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to us, came into effect on May 25, 2018. Like the CCPA, the GDPR defines “personal data” broadly, and it enhances data protection obligations for controllers of such data and for service providers processing the data. It also provides certain rights, such as access and deletion, to the individuals about whom the personal data relates. The digital advertising industry has collaborated to create a user-facing framework for establishing and managing legal bases under the GDPR and other EU privacy laws including ePrivacy (discussed below). Although the framework is actively in use, it is under attack by the Belgian Data Protection Authority and others and we cannot predict its effectiveness over the long term.  European regulators have questioned the framework’s viability and activists have filed complaints with regulators of alleged non-compliance by specific companies that employ the framework. Continuing to maintain compliance with the GDPR’s requirements, including monitoring and adjusting to rulings and interpretations that affect our approach to compliance, requires significant time, resources and expense, and may lead to significant changes in our business operations, as will the effort to monitor whether additional changes to our business practices and our backend configuration are needed, all of which may increase operating costs, or limit our ability to operate or expand our business.



Additionally, in the EU, EU Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), commonly referred to as the ePrivacy or Cookie Directive, directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie and other similar technologies, is allowed only if the Internet user has been informed about such access, and provided consent. A recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union clarified that such consent must be reflected by an affirmative act of the user, and European regulators are increasingly agitating for more robust forms of consent. These developments may result in decreased reliance on implied consent mechanisms that have been used to meet requirements of the Cookie Directive in some markets. A replacement for the Cookie Directive is currently under discussion by EU member states to complement and bring electronic communication services in line with the GDPR and force a harmonized approach across EU member states. Although it remains under debate, the proposed ePrivacy Regulation may further raise the bar for the use of cookies, and the fines and penalties for breach may be significant. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business.





7








As the collection and use of data for digital advertising has received media attention over the past several years, some government regulators, such as the FTC, and privacy advocates have suggested creating a “Do Not Track” standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browser, not to have their online browsing activities tracked. The CPRA similarly contemplates the use of technical opt outs for the sale and sharing of personal information for advertising purposes as well as to opt out of the use of sensitive information for advertising purposes, and allows for AG rulemaking to develop these technical signals. If a “Do Not Track,” “Do Not Sell,” or similar control is adopted by many Internet users or if a “Do Not Track” standard is imposed by state, federal, or foreign legislation (as it arguably is to some degree under the CCPA regulations), or is agreed upon by standard setting groups, we may have to change our business practices, our clients may reduce their use of our platform, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.



Furthermore, additional governmental regulations, including foreign governmental regulations, may affect our business. For more information, see the section “Risk Factors”.



Environmental Matters

This number was determined by dividing C$250,000 by the Offering Price.
