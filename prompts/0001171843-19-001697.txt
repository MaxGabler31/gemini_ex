Business
 
Old Line Bancshares, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on April 11, 2003 to serve as the holding company of Old Line Bank. The primary business of Old Line Bancshares, Inc. is to own all of the capital stock of Old Line Bank.

We also have an investment in a real estate investment limited liability company named Pointer Ridge Office Investment, LLC (“Pointer Ridge”). We currently own 100% of Pointer Ridge and we have consolidated its results of operations from the date of acquisition. In August 2016, Old Line Bank purchased the aggregate 37.5% minority interest in Pointer Ridge not held by Old Line Bancshares and on September 2, 2016, we paid off the entire $5.8 million principal amount of a promissory note previously issued by Pointer Ridge. On September 28, 2017, Old Line Bancshares transferred and assigned its ownership interest in Pointer Ridge to Old Line Bank, and as a result Old Line Bank acquired all rights, title and interest in Pointer Ridge. Pointer Ridge owns our headquarters building located at 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, Maryland, containing approximately 40,000 square feet. We occupy 98% of this building for our main office and operate a branch of Old Line Bank from this address.
 
Old Line Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company. Old Line Bank was originally chartered in 1989 as a national bank under the name “Old Line National Bank.” In June 2002, Old Line Bank converted to a Maryland-chartered trust company exercising the powers of a commercial bank and received a Certificate of Authority to do business from the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the “Commissioner”).
 
Old Line Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company (with all of the powers of a commercial bank). Old Line Bank does not exercise trust powers and its regulatory structure is the same as a Maryland-chartered commercial bank. Old Line Bank’s primary regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and it is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Commissioner and the FDIC. Old Line Bank’s deposits are insured to the maximum legal limits by the FDIC.
 
We are headquartered in Bowie, Maryland, approximately 10 miles east of Andrews Air Force Base and 20 miles east of Washington, D.C. We operate a general commercial banking business, making various types of loans and accepting deposits. We market our financial services to small to medium sized businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, consumers and high net worth clients.
 
Our principal source of revenue is interest income and fees generated by lending and investing funds on deposit. We typically balance the loan and investment portfolio towards loans. Generally speaking, loans earn more attractive returns than investments and are a key source of product cross sales and customer referrals. Our loan and investment strategies balance the need to maintain adequate liquidity via excess cash or federal funds sold with opportunities to leverage our capital appropriately.
 
In June 2012, we established Old Line Financial Services as a division of Old Line Bank and hired an individual with over 25 years of experience to manage this division. Old Line Financial Services allows us to expand the services we provide our customers to include retirement planning and products. Additionally, this division offers investment services including investment management, estate and succession planning and allows our customers to directly purchase individual stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Through this division customers may also purchase life insurance, long term care insurance and key man/woman insurance.

Location and Market Area
 
We consider our current market area to consist of the suburban Maryland counties of Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Harford, Howard, Prince George’s, Montgomery, and St. Mary’s (Washington, D.C. suburbs) and Baltimore and Carroll (Baltimore City suburbs). The economy in our current market area has focused on real estate development, high technology, retail and the government sector.
 
Our headquarters and a branch are located at 1525 Pointer Ridge Place, Bowie, Prince George’s County, Maryland. A critical component of our strategic plan and future growth is a focus on Prince George’s and Montgomery Counties. Prince George’s County wraps around the eastern boundary of Washington, D.C. and offers urban, suburban and rural settings for employers and residents. There are several national and international airports less than an hour away, as is Baltimore City. We currently have six branch locations, as well as the office that houses our mortgage origination group, in Prince George’s County.
 
We opened a loan production office in Silver Spring, in Montgomery County, Maryland in 2013. We opened our first branch in Rockville, Maryland, in Montgomery County in 2015 and a second location, located in the Rockville Town Center, in 2016. We acquired three more locations in Montgomery County in 2017 as a result of the DCB acquisition. These branches are located in Damascus, Clarksburg and Gaithersburg. Montgomery County is located just to the north of Washington, D.C., and is adjacent to Frederick, Howard and Prince George’s Counties in Maryland and Loudoun and Fairfax Counties in Virginia. Montgomery County is an important business and research center and is the third largest biotechnology cluster in the United States.

Several large firms are also based in the county, including Marriott International, Lockheed Martin, GEICO, and the Travel Channel. Montgomery County has the 17th highest median household income in the U.S., and the third highest in the state of Maryland. 1
 
We currently have four branch offices and a loan production office located in Charles County, Maryland. Just 15 miles south of the Washington Capital Beltway, Charles County is the gateway to Southern Maryland. The northern part of Charles County is the “development district” where the commercial, residential and business growth is focused. Waldorf, White Plains and the planned community of St. Charles are located here. Charles County has the 23rd highest median household income in the U.S., and the fifth highest in the state of Maryland. 1

Four of our branch offices, one of which includes a loan production office, are located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Anne Arundel County borders the Chesapeake Bay and is situated in the high tech corridor between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. With over 534 miles of shoreline, it provides waterfront living for many residential communities. Annapolis, the State Capital and home to the United States Naval Academy, and Baltimore/Washington International
 
Thurgood Marshal Airport (BWI) is located in Anne Arundel County. Anne Arundel County has one of the strongest economies in the State of Maryland and its unemployment rate is consistently below the national average.
 
We have two branches and a loan production office in St. Mary’s County and one branch and loan production office in Calvert County. The unemployment rates in Calvert and St. Mary’s Counties are among the lowest in the state of Maryland and also consistently rank below the national average. Calvert County, located approximately 25 miles southeast of Washington, D.C., is one of several Maryland counties that comprise the Washington Metropolitan Area and is adjacent to Anne Arundel, Prince George’s, St. Mary’s and Charles Counties. Major employers in Calvert County include municipal and government agencies and Exelon/Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. St. Mary’s County is located approximately 35 miles southeast of Washington, D.C. It is adjacent to Charles and Calvert Counties and is home to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, a major naval air testing facility on the east coast of the United States. Calvert and St. Mary’s Counties have the 18th and 46th highest median household income in the U.S., respectively.
 
We have five branches in Baltimore County and two branches in Baltimore City The market area with respect to these branches consists of the Baltimore metropolitan statistical area., The economy of the Baltimore metropolitan area constitutes a diverse cross-section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, federal and local government, health care facilities and finance related employment. The largest employers in the Baltimore area include University System of Maryland, Johns Hopkins Hospital and Fort Meade. The Baltimore region is the 30th most populous area in the United States. 2
 
We have two branches in Carroll County Carroll County is bordered on the north by the Mason–Dixon line with Pennsylvania, and on the south by Howard County Carroll County is bordered on the west by Frederick County Carroll County Public Schools is the largest employer in Carroll County followed by McDaniel College.


We have two branches in Frederick County, both of which we acquired in the Damascus acquisition. Frederick County is located in the northern part of Maryland. Frederick County has experienced a rapid population increase in recent years. The county is sometimes associated with Western Maryland, depending on the definition used. It borders the southern border of Pennsylvania and the northeastern border of Virginia. Frederick County is ranked 7th in medium household income in the state of Maryland. 3
 
We have one branch in each of Harford and Howard Counties, Maryland, both of which we acquired upon our acquisition of Bay Bank. Harford County straddles the border between the rolling hills of the Piedmont Plateau and the flatlands of the Atlantic Coastal Plain along the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The county's development is a mix of rural and suburban. Howard County, located in central Maryland, is frequently cited for its affluence, quality of life, and excellent schools. With an estimated median household income of $120,941, Howard County had the second-highest median household income of any U.S. county in 2016. 1
 
Lending Activities
 
General. Our primary market focus is on making loans to small and medium size businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals, consumers and high net worth clients in our market area. Our lending activities consist generally of short to medium term commercial business loans, commercial real estate loans, real estate construction loans, home equity loans and consumer installment loans, both secured and unsecured. We also originate residential loans for sale in the secondary market in addition to originating residential loans we maintain in our portfolio.

Credit Policies and Administration. We have adopted a comprehensive lending policy, which includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans. Our lending staff follows pricing guidelines established periodically by our management team. In an effort to manage risk, prior to funding, the loan committee which consists of four non-employee members of the board of directors and four executive officers must approve by majority vote all credit decisions in excess of a lending officer’s lending authority. Management believes that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral and carefully monitor the financial condition of our borrowers and the concentrations of loans in the portfolio.
 
In addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to risks stemming from the state of the economy and the related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market. With the exception of loans provided to finance luxury boats, which we originated prior to 2008, generally longer term loans have periodic interest rate adjustments and/or call provisions. Senior management monitors the loan portfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.
 
Old Line Bank also engages an outside, independent firm to review the loan portfolio. This firm performs a detailed annual review and an interim update at least once a year. We use the results of the firm’s report to validate our internal loan ratings and we review their commentary on specific loans and on our loan administration activities in order to improve our operations.
 
Commercial and Industrial Lending. Our commercial and industrial lending consists of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, accounts receivable financing, term loans, equipment loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, standby letters of credit and unsecured loans. We originate commercial loans for any business purpose including the financing of leasehold improvements and equipment, the carrying of accounts receivable, general working capital and acquisition activities. We have a diverse client base and we do not have a concentration of these types of loans in any specific industry segment. We generally secure commercial business loans with accounts receivable, equipment, deeds of trust and other collateral such as marketable securities, cash value of life insurance, and time deposits at Old Line Bank.
 
Commercial business loans have a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the availability of funds for repayment generally depends on the success of the business. They may also involve higher average balances, increased difficulty monitoring and a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business. To help manage this risk, we typically limit these loans to proven businesses and we generally obtain appropriate collateral and personal guarantees from the borrower’s principal owners and monitor the financial condition of the business. For loans in excess of $250,000, monitoring usually includes a review of the borrower’s annual tax returns and updated financial statements.
 
Commercial Real Estate Lending. We finance commercial real estate for our clients, usually for owner occupied properties. We generally will finance owner occupied commercial real estate at a loan to value that does not exceed 80%. Our underwriting policies and processes focus on the clients’ ability to repay the loan as well as an assessment of the underlying real estate. We originate commercial real estate loans on a fixed rate or adjustable rate basis. Usually, these rates adjust during a three, five or seven year time period based on the then current treasury or prime rate index. Repayment terms generally include amortization schedules ranging from three years to 25 years with principal and interest payments due monthly and with all remaining principal due at maturity. We also make commercial real estate construction loans, primarily for owner-occupied properties.
 
Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending. Risks inherent in managing a commercial real estate portfolio relate to sudden or gradual drops in property values as well as changes in the economic climate that may detrimentally impact the borrower’s ability to repay. We attempt to mitigate these risks by carefully underwriting these loans. Our underwriting generally includes an analysis of the borrower’s capacity to repay, the current collateral value, a cash flow analysis and review of the character of the borrower and current and prospective conditions in the market. We generally limit loans in this category to 75% - 80% of the value of the property and require personal and/or corporate guarantees. For loans of this type in excess of $250,000, we monitor the financial condition and operating performance of the borrower through a review of annual tax returns and updated financial statements. In addition, we will meet with the borrower and/or perform site visits as required.

Hospitality loans are segregated into a separate category under commercial real estate. An individual review of these loans indicate that they generally have a low loan to value, more than acceptable existing or projected cash flow, are to experienced operators and are generally dispersed throughout our market area.
 
Residential Real Estate Lending. We offer a variety of consumer-oriented residential real estate loans. A portion of our portfolio is made up of home equity loans to individuals with a loan to value not exceeding 80%. We also offer fixed rate home improvement loans. Our home equity and home improvement loan portfolio gives us a diverse client base. Although most of these loans are in our market area, the diversity of the individual loans in the portfolio reduces our potential risk. Usually, we secure our home equity loans and lines of credit with a security interest in the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Our initial underwriting includes an analysis of the borrower’s debt/income ratio which generally may not exceed 43%. We also consider the borrower’s length of employment and prior credit history in the approval process. Typically, we require borrowers to have a credit score of at least 640, except for loans originated for sale in the secondary market, as discussed below. We do not originate subprime residential real estate loans.
 
We obtain detailed loan applications to determine a borrower’s ability to repay and verify the more significant items on these applications through credit reports, financial statements and verifications. We also require appraisals of collateral and title insurance on secured real estate loans.
 
A portion of this segment of the loan portfolio consists of funds advanced for construction of custom single family residences (where the home buyer is the borrower), financing to builders for the construction of pre-sold homes, and loans for multi-family housing. These loans generally have short durations, meaning maturities typically of 12 months or less. Residential houses, multi-family dwellings and commercial buildings under construction and the underlying land for which the loan was obtained secure the construction loans. The vast majority of these loans are concentrated in our market area.
 
Construction lending entails significant risk. These risks generally involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers with funds advanced upon the security of the land or the project under construction. An appraisal of the property estimates the value of the project “as is” and “as if completed.” Thus, initial funds are advanced based on the current value of the property, with the remaining construction funds advanced under a budget sufficient to successfully complete the project within the “as completed” loan to value. To further mitigate these risks, we generally limit loan amounts to 80% or less of appraised values, obtain first lien positions on the property securing the loan, and adhere to established underwriting procedures. In addition, we generally offer real estate construction financing only to experienced builders, commercial entities or individuals who have demonstrated the ability to obtain a permanent loan “take-out” (conversion to a permanent mortgage upon completion of the project). We also perform a complete analysis of the borrower and the project prior to construction. This analysis includes a review of the cost to construct, the borrower’s ability to obtain a permanent “take-out,” the cash flow available to support the debt payments and construction costs in excess of loan proceeds, and the value of the collateral. During construction, we advance funds on these loans on a percentage of completion basis. We inspect each project as needed prior to advancing funds during the term of the construction loan. We may provide permanent financing on the same projects for which we have provided the construction financing.
 
Under our loan approval policy, all residential real estate loans approved must comply with federal regulations. Generally, we will make residential mortgage loans in amounts up to the limits established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for secondary market resale purposes. Currently this amount for single-family residential loans currently varies from $453,100 up to a maximum of $679,650 for certain high-cost designated areas. We also make residential mortgage loans up to limits established by the Federal Housing Administration, which currently is $679,650. The Washington, D.C. and Baltimore areas are both considered high-cost designated areas. We will, however, make loans in excess of these amounts if we believe that we can sell the loans in the secondary market or that the loans should be held in our portfolio. For loans we originate for sale in the secondary market, we typically require a credit score of 620 or higher, with some exceptions provided we receive an approval recommendation from FannieMae, FreddieMac or the Federal Housing Administration’s (“FHA”) automated underwriting approval system. Loans sold in the secondary market are sold to investors on a servicing released basis and recorded as loans as held for sale.  The premium is recorded in income on marketable loans in non-interest income, net of commissions paid to the loan officers.
 
Land Acquisition and Development Lending. These loans are usually used to fund the acquisition and development of unimproved properties to be used for residential or non-residential construction. We may provide permanent financing on the same projects for which we have provided the construction financing.

-

 
Land acquisition and development lending, while providing higher yields, may also have greater risks of loss than long-term residential mortgage loans on improved, owner-occupied properties.
 
Old Line Bank generally makes land acquisition loans with terms of up to three years and loan to value ratios of up to 65%, and land development loans with terms of up to two years and loan-to-value ratios of up to 75%.
 
The primary loan-specific risks in land acquisition and land development lending are increases in local unemployment that decrease the demand for housing, deterioration of the business and/or collateral values, deterioration of the financial condition of the borrowers and/or guarantors that creates a risk of default, and that an appraisal on the collateral is not reflective of the true property value. Portfolio risks include the condition of the economy, changing demand for these types of loans, large concentration of these types of loans, and geographic concentrations of these types of loans.
 
Consumer Installment Lending. We offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. We make consumer loans for personal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base. This category includes our luxury boat loans, which we made prior to 2008 and that remain in our portfolio. Consumer loans, however, are not a focus of our lending activities. The underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of his or her ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. As a general guideline, the borrower’s total debt service should not exceed 40% of his or her gross income.
 
Our consumer loan portfolio, includes indirect loans, primarily auto and RV loans. These loans are financed through dealers and the dealers receive a percentage of the finance charge, which varies depending on the terms of each loan. We use the same underwriting standards in originating these indirect loans as we do for consumer loans generally.
 
Consumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because many consumer loans are either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. Consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability. If a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid. Also, various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.
 
Lending Limit. As of December 31, 2018, our legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $46.6 million. As part of our risk management strategy, we may attempt to participate a portion of larger loans to other financial institutions. This strategy allows Old Line Bank to maintain customer relationships yet reduce its credit exposure. However, this strategy may not always be available.
 
Investments and Funding
 
We balance our liquidity needs based on loan and deposit growth via the investment portfolio, purchased funds, and short term borrowings. It is our goal to provide adequate liquidity to support our loan growth. In the event we have excess liquidity, we use investments to generate positive earnings. In the event deposit growth does not fully support our loan growth, we can use a combination of investment sales, federal funds, other purchased funds and short term borrowings to augment our funding position.
 
We actively monitor our investment portfolio and we usually classify investments in the portfolio as “available for sale.” In general, under such a classification, we may sell investment instruments as management deems appropriate. On a monthly basis, we “mark to market” the investment portfolio through an adjustment to stockholders’ equity net of taxes. Additionally, we use the investment portfolio to balance our asset and liability position. We invest in fixed rate or floating rate instruments as necessary to reduce our interest rate risk exposure.
 
Other Banking Products
 
We offer our customers safe deposit boxes, wire transfer services, debit cards, prepaid cards, automated teller machines at all of our branch locations, investment services, and credit cards through a third party processor. Additionally, we provide Internet and mobile banking capabilities to our customers. With our Internet banking service, our customers may view their accounts online and electronically remit bill payments. Our commercial account services include direct deposit of payroll for our commercial clients’ employees, an overnight sweep service, lockbox services and remote deposit capture service. We also provide our customers investment services including investment management, estate and succession planning, and brokerage services.

As a result of the BYBK acquisition, Old Line Bank became a member of the Point of Sale (“POS”) network sponsorship program, which allows our customers to access several processing and settlement networks; when our customers use one of these networks, Old Line Bank receives a transaction fee from the network.
 
Deposit Activities
 
Deposits are the major source of our funding. We offer a broad array of deposit products that include demand, NOW, money market and savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit. We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest bearing deposits. As a relationship-oriented organization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.
 
As our overall balance sheet position dictates, we may become more or less competitive in our interest rate structure. We do use brokered deposits as a funding mechanism. Our primary source of brokered deposits is the Promontory Interfinancial Network (Promontory). Through this deposit matching network and its certificate of deposit account and money market registry services, we have the ability to offer our customers access to FDIC-insured deposit products in aggregate amounts exceeding current insurance limits. When we place funds through Promontory on behalf of a customer, we receive matching deposits through the network. At December 31, 2018, we do not have any brokered deposits. We did not purchase brokered deposits during 2018.
 
Competition
 
We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete with other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in our market area and elsewhere, including Internet-based and technology-oriented non-bank financial providers.
 
We believe that we have effectively leveraged our talents, contacts and location to achieve a strong financial position. However, our market area is highly competitive and heavily branched. Competition in our market area for loans to small and medium sized businesses, entrepreneurs, professionals and high net worth clients is intense, and pricing is important. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and offer extensive and established branch networks and other services that we do not offer. Moreover, larger institutions operating in our market area have access to borrowed funds at a lower rate than is available to us. Deposit competition also is strong among institutions in our market area. As a result, it is possible that to remain competitive we may need to pay above market rates for deposits.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 348 full time and 16 part time employees. No collective bargaining unit represents any of our employees and we believe that relations with our employees are good.
Supervision and Regulation
 
Old Line Bancshares, Inc. and Old Line Bank are subject to extensive regulation under state and federal banking laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose specific requirements and restrictions on virtually all aspects of operations and generally are intended to protect depositors, not stockholders. The following summary sets forth certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to Old Line Bancshares, Inc. and Old Line Bank. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.

Under the Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. Under this requirement, Old Line Bancshares in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to Old Line Bank should Old Line Bank experience financial distress. In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the “source of strength” doctrine. The Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary (other than a non-bank subsidiary of a bank) upon the Federal Reserve Board’s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company. Further, federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non-bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution’s financial condition.
 
The Federal Reserve Board must approve, among other things, the acquisition by a bank holding company of control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or bank holding company or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. In general, the Bank Holding Company Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services for its authorized subsidiaries, and engaging in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking and/or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary, investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare.
 
The Change in Bank Control Act and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve Board require any person, or persons acting in concert, to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve Board before the person or persons acquire direct or indirect “control” of a bank or bank holding company. As a general matter, a party is deemed to control a bank or bank holding company if the party owns or controls 25% or more of any class of voting stock. Subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a bank or bank holding company if the investor owns or controls 10% or more of any class of voting stock and (i) the institution has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and (ii) no other person owns, controls or has the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. If a party’s ownership of Old Line Bancshares, Inc. were to exceed the above thresholds, the investor could be deemed to “control” Old Line Bancshares, Inc. for regulatory purposes. This could subject the investor to regulatory filings or other regulatory consequences.

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, which require bank holding companies to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See “—Capital Adequacy Guidelines.” The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition.
 
The status of Old Line Bancshares as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act does not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to Maryland corporations generally, including, without limitation, federal and state securities laws.
 
Old Line Bank
 
Old Line Bank is a Maryland-chartered trust company (with all of the powers of a commercial bank). Its primary federal regulator is the FDIC and it is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Commissioner and by the FDIC. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of Old Line Bank’s business, including required reserves against deposits, lending, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and location and number of branch offices. In addition, Old Line Bank is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that set forth specific requirements with respect to extensions of credit, credit practices, disclosure of credit terms, and discrimination in credit transactions.
 
The FDIC and the Commissioner regularly examine the operations and condition of Old Line Bank, including, but not limited to, its capital adequacy, reserves, loans, investments, and management practices. These examinations are for the protection of Old Line Bank’s depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. In addition, Old Line Bank is required to furnish quarterly and annual reports to the FDIC. The enforcement authority of the FDIC and the Commissioner include the power to remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a bank from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.
 
The FDIC has adopted regulations regarding capital adequacy, which require member banks to maintain specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. See “—Capital Adequacy Guidelines.” FDIC regulations and state law limit the amount of dividends that Old Line Bank may pay to Old Line Bancshares, Inc. See “—Dividends.”
 
Capital Adequacy Guidelines
 
Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. In addition, the regulations limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions, engage in share repurchases, and pay certain discretionary bonus payments if it does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
 
There are two main categories of capital under the capital adequacy guidelines. Tier 1 capital generally consists of the sum of common stockholders’ equity and perpetual preferred stock (subject in the case of the latter to limitations on the kind and amount of such stock) and, in certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations, minority investments in certain subsidiaries, less goodwill and other non-qualifying intangible assets, and certain other deductions. Tier 2 capital consists of perpetual preferred stock that is not otherwise eligible to be included as Tier 1 capital, hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock and, subject to limitations, general allowances for credit losses. Tier 2 capital is limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital. We have elected to permanently opt out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in our capital calculations, as permitted by the regulations. This opt-out will reduce the impact of market volatility on our regulatory capital levels.

Under federal prompt corrective action regulations, the bank regulatory agencies are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required, to take various “prompt corrective actions” to resolve the problems of any bank subject to their jurisdiction that is not adequately capitalized, as set forth in the next sentence. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act the agencies have established five capital tiers for depository institutions: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, a bank is considered “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; (iv) a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (v) is not subject to any written order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Under certain circumstances, a bank regulatory agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the bank regulatory agency may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized). As of December 31, 2018, Old Line Bank was “well capitalized” for this purpose and its capital exceeded all applicable requirements.
 
As required by Section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed a new rule to establish a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”) that will simplify the capital adequacy measures for certain depository institutions and their holding companies that, like Old Line Bancshares and Old Line Bank, have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets. Under the proposal, most of such depository institutions (and their holding companies) that meet certain risk-based qualifying criteria (generally, those with limited amounts of off-balance sheet exposure, trading assets and liabilities, mortgage servicing assets, and temporary difference in deferred tax assets) and maintain a CBLR of more than 9.0% may opt into the proposed community bank leverage framework. Such institutions and their holding companies would not be subject to the other risk-based and leverage requirements of the current rules, as discussed above, and will be considered to have met the requirements for being considered well capitalized.
 
The risk-based qualifying criteria under the proposed rule include: (i) total off-balance sheet exposures of no more than 25.0% of total consolidated assets; (ii) total trading assets and liabilities of no more than 5.0% of total consolidated assets; (iii) mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”) of no more than 25% of CBLR; and (iv) temporary difference deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) of no more than 25% of CBLR tangible equity. Under the proposed rule, CBLR would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital (CBLR tangible equity) divided by average total consolidated assets. CBLR tangible equity would be defined as total equity capital prior to including minority interests and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), DTAs arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, goodwill, and other intangible assets (other than MSAs), each as of the most recent calendar quarter. Average total consolidated assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current Tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the CBLR numerator would also be excluded from the CBLR denominator. The proposed rule would also permit more flexibility with respect to the types of instruments that could qualify for CBLR tangible equity.
 
As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
 
Deposit Insurance Assessments
 
Old Line Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000. The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on all insured depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions deemed less risky to the deposit insurance fund paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 1.5 to 40 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the range of assessments uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base assessment rate without notice and comment rulemaking. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Maryland Regulatory Assessment
 
The Commissioner assesses state chartered banks to cover the expense of regulating banking institutions. Old Line Bank’s asset size determines the amount of the assessment. In 2018, we paid $190 thousand to the Commissioner.
 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 
Federal and Maryland law impose restrictions on certain transactions between Maryland commercial banks and their insiders and affiliates. Generally, under Maryland law, a director, officer or employee of a commercial bank may not borrow, directly or indirectly, any money from the bank, unless the loan has been approved by a resolution adopted by and recorded in the minutes of the board of directors of the bank or the executive committee of the bank, if that committee is authorized to approve loans. If the executive committee approves such a loan, the loan approval must be reported to the board of directors at its next meeting. Certain commercial loans made to directors of a bank and certain consumer loans made to non-officer employees of the bank are exempt from the law’s coverage. Under federal law, section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation O govern extensions of credit made by a bank to its directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders (“insiders”). Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent, than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Further, such extensions may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. Extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be also be approved by the board of directors. All of Old Line Bank’s loans to its and Old Line Bancshares’ executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders, and affiliated interests of such persons, comply with the requirements of Regulation O.
 
Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus. An affiliate of a bank is generally any company or entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies that are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees, and other similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by a bank to an affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with regulatory requirements and the bank’s transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and may not involve the purchase by the bank of any low-quality asset from an affiliate. Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act applies to covered transactions as well as certain other transactions between a bank and its affiliates and Section 23B and Regulation W require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those provided to non-affiliates. Regulation W generally excludes a bank subsidiary from treatment as an affiliate unless the subsidiary is a depository institution, a financial subsidiary, directly controlled by an affiliate or controlling shareholder of the bank, or unless the Federal Reserve Board or other appropriate federal regulator determines by regulation or order to treat the subsidiary as a bank affiliate. All of Old Line Bank’s transactions with its affiliates comply with the applicable provisions of Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W.
 
We have entered into banking transactions with our directors and executive officers and the business and professional organizations with which they are associated in the ordinary course of business. We make such loans and loan commitments in accordance with all applicable laws.

Loans to One Borrower
 
Old Line Bank is subject to statutory and regulatory limits on the amount that it may lend to a single borrower or group of related borrowers. Generally, the maximum amount of total outstanding loans that Old Line Bank may have to any one borrower at any one time is 15% of Old Line Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Old Line Bank may lend an additional amount, equal to 10% of its unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain securities and bullion but generally does not include real estate.
Liquidity
 
Old Line Bank is subject to the reserve requirements imposed by the State of Maryland. A Maryland commercial bank is required to have at all times a reserve equal to at least 15% of its demand deposits and at least 3% of its time deposits. Old Line Bank is also subject to the reserve requirements of Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation D, which applies to all depository institutions. During 2018, amounts in transaction accounts above $16.0 million and up to $122.3 million were required to have reserves held against them in the ratio of 3% of such amounts. Amounts above $124.2 million required reserves of 10% of the amount in excess of $122.3 million. The Federal Reserve Board changes its reserve requirements on an annual basis and Old Line Bank is subject to new requirements for 2019. Old Line Bank was in compliance with its reserve requirements at December 31, 2018 and is in compliance with its current reserve requirements.
Dividends
 
Old Line Bancshares, Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from Old Line Bank. Virtually all of Old Line Bancshares, Inc.’s revenue available for the payment of dividends on its common stock results from dividends paid to Old Line Bancshares, Inc. by Old Line Bank. Under Maryland law, Old Line Bank may declare a cash dividend, after providing for due or accrued expenses, losses, interest, and taxes, from its undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, from its surplus in excess of 100% of its required capital stock. Also, if Old Line Bank’s surplus is less than 100% of its required capital stock, then, until its surplus is 100% of its capital stock, Old Line Bank must transfer to its surplus annually at least 10% of its net earnings and may not declare or pay any cash dividends that exceed 90% of its net earnings. In addition to these specific restrictions, the FDIC has the ability to prohibit or limit proposed dividends if it determines that the payment of such dividends would result in Old Line Bank being in an unsafe and unsound condition.
Community Reinvestment Act
 
Old Line Bank is required to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) regardless of its capital condition. The CRA requires that, in connection with its examinations of Old Line Bank, the FDIC evaluates Old Line Bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its local community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound operation. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. These factors are considered in, among other things, evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Old Line Bank received a “Satisfactory” rating in its latest CRA examination.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
 
Federal law requires the federal banking agencies to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC
 
Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include: established internal policies, procedures and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; testing of the program by an independent audit function and risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions, and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and they must consider an institution’s compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications, including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions. The regulatory authorities have imposed “cease and desist” orders and civil money penalty sanctions on institutions found to be violating these obligations.
 
The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC sends bank regulatory agencies lists of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If Old Line Bancshares or Old Line Bank finds a name on any transaction, account, or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, they must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report, and notify the appropriate authorities.
 
Consumer Protection Laws
 
Old Line Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, as well as various state law counterparts. Further, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is responsible for adopting rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services, with which Old Line Bank must comply. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service, and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The FDIC is responsible for examining Old Line Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and for enforcing CFPB rules with respect to Old Line Bank.
 
In addition, federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution’s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Further, under the “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards,” banks must implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.
