ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

Deseo Swimwear Inc. (“Deseo” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2015. We are a designer, manufacturer and marketer of Dominican Republic inspired swimwear. Our swimwear will be used on the beach, as well as in general recreational settings. We believe the Deseo Swimwear will become a recognized brand name in the Dominican inspired swimwear category. Founded in April of 2015, we have cultivated our proposed brand image through a variety of innovative designs. We plan to have our swimwear manufactured in the Dominican Republic and the United States to the highest specifications in quality, performance and styling.

The Company plans to sell its proposed high-end Dominican inspired swimwear product to boutique retailers and niche on-line stores primarily in North America and then eventually expand to a larger international market if successful. The Company plans to launch its website as an advertising tool to drive potential customers to our expected boutique retailers and niche on-line stores who we expect to sell our products.

Since our inception of April 20, 2015, we have started pre-launch operations, beginning with the designing of our first line of swimwear under the brand name DS-Series. We have also initiated the design of our web-site and begun sourcing third-party manufacturers to produce our swimwear line.

We will need additional funding to implement our marketing and operational plans.

Product

Our Deseo Swimwear-branded planned portfolio  of DS-Series1, DS-Series2 and DS-Series3 swimwear are designed for the highest levels of performance, styling, and enjoyment for both recreation and beachwear use. The DS-Series1 and DS-Series2 are geared towards the consumer seeking the most premium swimwear experience that we expect to offer, and generally command a price premium over our competitor’s swimwear at retail prices ranging from approximately $100 to $200. The DS-Series3 brand is planned to be an entry-level consumer with expected retail pricing from approximately $20 to $75. Our initial product lines will be for women as they account for approximately 70% of the swimwear market.

The Deseo collections are designed to be interchangeable, making the most out of each suit. Any customer that makes two purchases will in effect have four swimsuits. Customers will be given the opportunity to purchase a la carte (one piece at a time), so they can add to their existing collections if they only want a particular top or bottom. Pieces will be able to be worn for day and evening wear components. We have completed the initial design of our DS-Series1 and are in the process of third-party manufacturer to produce our sample prototypes prior to going into production for sale. The DS-Series2 and DS-Series3 will be introduced as funding becomes available.

The designs and styles we expect to be recognizable and become synonymous with Deseo Swimwear as a high-end fashion statement to be made on the beach, at the pool and on vacation.

Industry Analysis/Competition

Market/Competition Analysis 

During 2021, retail sales of new swimwear globally totaled $18.5 billion according to the NPD Group. Of the categories defined and tracked by the NPD Group, we believe our addressable market includes swimwear categories including Women’s Swimwear, Men’s Swimwear, Girls’ Swimwear and Boys’ Swimwear. For 2020, the market share of retails sails of new Women, Men, Girls and Boys Swimwear in the U.S. were 70%, 17%, 10% and 4% respectively. As a result, we believe the total annual addressable market for our proposed products in the U.S. alone in greater than $4 billion.

Major drivers for the swimwear and beachwear market include relaxed dress codes, increasing interest in body care, social mobility, and acceptance of swimming as relaxing pastime for an aging population and improved performance and innovation in swimwear materials by the textile industry. In particular woman are adopting healthier lifestyles-think CrossFit, yoga, boot camps – and syncing their diets around the farm-to-table phenomena-farmer markets, detox cleanses, growth of beauty and spa industry has fueled the increased sell of swimwear and beachwear as people and in particular woman want to expose their body. The market continues to morph into a year-round business, keeping companies on their toes to produce the right amount of new styles and skis. 

Europe and the United States exhibit the largest swimwear market, however Asian countries such as China are experiencing the fastest growth in recent years.

Competition

The swimwear industry has many competitors some of our competitors may have greater access to capital than we do and may use these resources to engage in aggressive advertising and marketing campaigns. The prevalence of aggressive advertising and promotion may generate pricing pressures to which we must respond. We expect that competition will continue to increase. We might not be able to compete with large companies if they were to drive prices down for the swimwear market.

The swimwear market remains challenging with a significate number of key players and an ever-expanding number of niche players. Consumers are demanding products that offer comfort, quality and safety and they are ready to spend on premium products. Swimwear companies who have focused primarily on competing at price have seen a decline in their percentage of the market. Those brands that are focused on design innovation and newness, there continues to be opportunity.

The key and niche players operating in the global swimwear and beachwear market include Arena Italia S.p.A, Diana Sport, Eveden Group, Jantzen, Inc., La Peral Group, NOZONE Clothing Limited, O’Neill, Inc., PARAH S.p.A., Pentland Group plc., Speedo International Ltd., Perry Ellis International, Inc., Quicksilver, Inc., Seafolly, Seaspray Swimwear, Tefron, TYR Sport and PVH Corp.
