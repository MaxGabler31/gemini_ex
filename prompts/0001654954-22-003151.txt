Item 1. Business
Overview

Headquartered in Pittsford, New York, Infinite Group is a developer of cybersecurity software and related cybersecurity consulting, advisory, and managed information security services. We principally sell our software and services through indirect channels such as Managed Service Providers (“MSPs”), Managed Security Services Providers (“MSSPs”), agents and distributors and government contractors, whom we refer to collectively as our channel partners. We also sell directly to end customers.

We believe our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the cybersecurity market at a time when competition and consolidation in these markets are on the rise. Our strategy to differentiate our cybersecurity software and services from our competitors is to combine customized software and professional services, and grow our business by designing, developing, and marketing cybersecurity software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) solutions that can be deployed in myriad environments. Software and services are initially developed in our wholly-owned subsidiary, IGI CyberLabs (“CyberLabs”), to fill technology gaps we identify, and then we bring these software and services to market through our existing channel partner and customer relationships. Our software and services are designed to simplify and manage the security needs of our customers and channel partners in a variety of environments. We focus on the small and medium-sized enterprises market. We support our channel partners by providing recurring-revenue business models for both services and through our cybersecurity SaaS solutions. Products may be sold as standalone solutions or integrated into existing environments to further automate the management of cybersecurity and related IT functions.

As part of these software and service offerings we:


· | Internally developed and brought to market Nodeware®, a patented SaaS solution that automates network asset identification, and cybersecurity vulnerability management and monitoring. Nodeware simply and affordably enhances security by proactively identifying, monitoring, and addressing potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities on networks, which creates enhanced security to safeguard against hackers and ransomware. Nodeware provides an economical solution for small and medium-sized enterprises as compared to more costly solutions focused on enterprise-sized customers, and is designed to accommodate the varying network needs of our end customers’ organizations and networks. Nodeware’s flexibility allows it to span from a single network to several subnetworks, as well as accommodating larger, more complex organizations with more advanced network needs. Nodeware is sold as a SaaS solution and continuously releases enhancements, updates, and upgrades to stay current with security needs and changes in the market. Nodeware is also designed to be integrated into other technology platforms. We primarily sell Nodeware through our channel partners, with a small percentage being sold directly to end customers. We intend to continue to develop our intellectual property to serve as the core to our proprietary software and services. In addition to our proprietary software and services we also act as a master distributor for other cybersecurity software, principally Webroot a cloud-based endpoint security platform solution, where we market to and provide support for over 225 small channel partners across North America. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our software revenue was approximately $1,011,000, with approximately 17% of that being related to Nodeware;

· | Provide cybersecurity consulting and advisory services to channel partners and direct customers across different markets, including banking, manufacturing, supply chain, and technology. As part of our consulting and advisory services, we are contracted to support existing information technology and executive teams at both the customer and channel partner level, and provide security leadership and guidance. We validate overall corporate and infrastructure cybersecurity with the goal of maintaining and securing the integrity of confidential client information, preserving the continuity of services, and minimizing potential data damage from threats and incidents. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our cybersecurity consulting services revenue, excluding software sales, was approximately $1,769,000; and 
· | Provide managed support services related to information security, principally as a subcontractor for Peraton, a large information technology provider and U.S. government contractor, by providing in-depth troubleshooting, backend analysis, and technical and security support, commonly referred to as Level 2 support, for mission critical technical infrastructure from the server level to the end user interface application in a critical government environment. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our managed support services revenue was approximately $4,303,000.

Sales and Marketing Strategy

Approximately 89% of our business comes from our channel sales and approximately 11% from direct sales to end customers. Managed support services accounts for approximately 60% of total sales, cybersecurity software and services accounts for approximate 38% of total sales and other consulting services accounts for approximately 2% of total sales.

Virtually all managed information security support services revenue is derived from one customer, a major independent agency of the U.S. Government for which we manage one of the nation’s largest physical and virtual Microsoft Windows environments as a subcontractor through our channel partner, Peraton. We are working to expand our managed information security support services business with our channel partner Peraton, and to potentially grow the current federal enterprise customer and to expand to other Peraton customers.

We sell our cybersecurity software and services, including Nodeware, through our channel partners, which include direct channel partners, Telarus, TD SYNNEX, and Staples, and through our direct cybersecurity services teams. Our cybersecurity services include Chief Information Security Team as a Service (CISOTaaS ™), PenLogic™ penetration testing services, security assessments, incident response and others, and are provided through our channel partners and direct to end customers as a cybersecurity solution to the technical services they provide. Our channel partners utilize our expertise in cybersecurity to bring additional services to their end customers that are beyond their normal scope of offerings, and building our network of channel partners allows us the ability to efficiently gain access to a greater number of customers. We continue to drive development of our cybersecurity business through channel and direct marketing, social media programs, and fostering our extensive cybersecurity industry relationships. We are not reliant on any one customer for our cybersecurity software and services sales given that we work with a number of channel partners and direct customers. In addition to our cybersecurity software and services, we provide from time to time other information technology consulting services to existing clients.

Recent Developments

In accordance with our strategic roll-up strategy, on January 31, 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire the issued and outstanding equity securities of Pratum, Inc. (“Pratum”), an Iowa corporation and an information securities firm. Pratum provides cybersecurity consulting and advisory services, risk assessments, and managed extended detection and response (“XDR”) services, which we believe is a strategic fit for us. The aggregate purchase price under the Pratum agreement is $8,500,000, subject to customary purchase price adjustments for, among other things, indebtedness of Pratum as of the closing. $8,000,000 will be paid to Pratum’s shareholder at closing and $500,000 will be deposited at closing with an escrow agent to be held in escrow for a period of six months. It is anticipated that the transaction will close in the first half of 2022. Pratum will keep its name and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. For more information, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2022.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had sales of approximately $7.2 million, an operating loss of approximately $1.4 million and a net loss of approximately $1.6 million, due primarily to increased investment in sales and marketing for Nodeware and related services, together with increased costs associated with our preparations to list on and with assessing potential acquisition targets. As a result of growing demand and accelerated growth in the cybersecurity market, we continue to grow our team of cybersecurity sales and technical consultants internally and leverage contractors when needed to fill short term gaps. We added 12 new employees, primarily in the areas of sales, marketing, and technical consulting for cybersecurity services in 2021. We had full year sales of approximately $7.2 million in 2020 and $7.1 million in 2019, generating operating income of approximately $1,000 and $329,000 and net income of approximately $676,000 and $48,000, respectively.

In June 2021, we created IGI CyberLabs, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, to support our Nodeware solution and continued software development. CyberLabs’s overarching mission is to drive sales of our Nodeware Cloud security solution, which we believe will drive monthly and annualized recurring revenue. CyberLabs will also drive product and platform enhancements in Nodeware and new cloud and SaaS cybersecurity related products that will be brought to market through our growing channel partner relationships.

On November 3, 2021, we entered into a financing arrangement (the “Bridge Loan”) with Mast Hill Fund, L.P. (the “Lender”), a Delaware limited partnership. In exchange for a promissory note, Lender agreed to lend the Company $448,000, which bears interest at a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, less $44,800 original issue discount. Under the terms of the Loan, amortization payments are due beginning March 3, 2022, and each month thereafter with the final payment due on November 3, 2022. On February 15, 2022, we entered into a second financing arrangement together with the Bridge Loan, the “Loans”) with Lender. In exchange for a promissory note, Lender agreed to lend the Company $370,000, which bears interest at a rate of eight percent (8%) per annum, less $37,000 original issue discount. Under the terms of the Loans, amortization payments are due beginning four months from the issue date, and each month thereafter with the final payment due on one year anniversary of the Loans. Additionally, in the event of a default under the Loans or if the Company elects to pre-pay the Loans, the Lender has the right to convert any portion or all of the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.10 per share. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information regarding the Loans.

On December 15, 2021, our board of directors (the “Board”) approved a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock by a ratio within the range of 3-to-1 and 75-to-1 of our outstanding shares of common stock and recommended that the stockholders of the Company authorize the Board, in its discretion, for one year, to determine the final ratio, effective date, and date of filing of the certificate of amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, in connection with the reverse stock split. On January 26, 2022, the company’s stockholder voted to authorize the reverse stock split. As of the date of this report, the Board has not set a record date or a ratio for the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split will not impact the number of authorized shares of common stock which will remain at 60,000,000 shares. All option, share and per share information in this prospectus does not give effect to the reverse stock split.

Business Strategy

We have a threefold business strategy composed of:


· | providing differentiated cybersecurity software and services to small to mid-sized enterprises who lack the internal resources to focus on cybersecurity related matters by combining customized software and professional services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | designing, developing, and marketing cybersecurity SaaS solutions, including our Nodeware solution; and 
· | identifying other cybersecurity companies to acquire as part of a strategic roll-up strategy. 


We believe our ability to succeed depends on how successful we are in differentiating ourselves in the market at a time when competition and consolidation in these markets is on the rise. Our software and services are designed to simplify the security needs of our customers and channel partners, with a focus on the small to mid-sized enterprises, and we believe our ability to integrate our product and service offerings differentiates them from our competitors. In addition, we support our channel partners by providing recurring-revenue business models for both services and our cybersecurity SaaS solutions.

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, so we devote significant efforts in developing proprietary software and services to meet our customer and channel partners’ evolving needs. These efforts have resulted in the development of our patented and patent-pending Nodeware solution. We expect to continue to make significant investments in developing other intellectual property to serve as the core to other proprietary software and services.

Historically, a significant portion of our revenues has been derived through our managed support services, however, we believe our cybersecurity SaaS solutions, including Nodeware, present an opportunity for significant growth. We believe that Nodeware’s ability to be deployed in an underserved market segment, across a wide variety of networks and the ability to integrate it into existing and new cybersecurity software and services, will allow us to significantly grow this segment of our business. Similarly, we believe Nodeware’s SaaS recurring revenue business model and its flexibility as a standalone or integrated solution makes it an attractive part of our channel partners’ portfolio of products. Accordingly, in 2021 we made significant investments in Nodeware sales and marketing to grow our team of cybersecurity sales and technical consultants. As a result, we believe we are seeing the pipeline growth expected from focused efforts, which we anticipate will convert to revenue growth in 2022 and beyond.

We believe the market for cybersecurity services for small and medium-sized enterprises is fragmented and does not currently meet the needs of this customer base. The market is fragmented and is beginning to consolidate, which is why we are seeking to strategically acquire other cybersecurity technology and services companies.

The following sections define specific components of our business strategy.

Nodeware®

Nodeware is a patented SaaS solution that automates network asset identification, and cybersecurity vulnerability management and monitoring. Nodeware simply and affordably enhances security by proactively identifying, monitoring, and addressing potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities on networks, which creates enhanced security to safeguard against hackers and ransomware. Nodeware’s flexibility allows it to span from a single network to several subnetworks, as well as accommodating larger, more complex organizations with more advanced network needs. Nodeware assesses vulnerabilities in a computer network using proprietary scanning technology to capture a comprehensive view of the security exposure of a network infrastructure. Users receive alerts and view network information through a proprietary, web enabled dashboard. Continuous and automated internal scanning and external on demand scanning are components of this offering. As described below, Nodeware has one patent and one patent pending. We intend to develop other intellectual property that serve as the core to other proprietary software and services to market through a channel of domestic and international partners and distributors.

Nodeware provides an economical solution for small and medium-sized enterprises as compared to costly solutions focused on enterprise sized customers, and is designed to accommodate the varying network needs of our end customers’ organizations and networks. Nodeware is sold as a SaaS solution and continuously releases enhancements, updates, and upgrades to stay current with security needs and changes in the market. Nodeware is also designed to be integrated into other technology platforms. We primarily sell Nodeware through our channel partners, with a small percentage being sold directly to end customers. Nodeware creates an opportunity for our channel partners to sell and use a product that provides greater visibility into the network security of an end customer. Since 2018, we have continued to expand our portfolio of channel partners, which now includes Telarus, TD SYNNEX, Staples, and a growing list of MSPs, MSSPs, agents and distributors and government contractors.

In June 2021, we created IGI CyberLabs, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, to support our Nodeware solution and continued software development. CyberLabs’s overarching mission is to drive sales of Nodeware, which we believe will drive monthly and annualized recurring revenue. CyberLabs will also drive product and platform enhancements across other current future subsidiaries as IGI’s strategic roll up of cybersecurity companies comes to fruition. This also enhances our ability to bring new cloud and SaaS cybersecurity related solutions to market through our growing channel partner relationships.

Cybersecurity Services

In addition to Nodeware, we provide cybersecurity consulting services that include incident response, security awareness training, cybersecurity risk management, IT governance and compliance, security assessment services, (CISOTaaS ™) and PenLogic™ penetration testing services offerings to channel partners and direct customers across different markets, including banking, manufacturing, supply chain, and technology, in North America. Our cybersecurity consulting projects leverage different technology platforms and processes, such as Nodeware, to create documentation and processes that a customer can use to continually improve overall IT governance and corporate security. We validate overall network and infrastructure security with the goal of maintaining the integrity of confidential client information, preserving the continuity of services, and minimizing potential data damage from cybersecurity threats and incidents. We continue to enhance our cybersecurity services based on feedback from customers and changes in the market.

Managed Support Services

We also provide managed support services related to information security, principally as a subcontractor for Peraton, a large information technology provider and U.S. government contractor, where we assume the responsibility for providing a defined set of cybersecurity services. These services typically include in-depth troubleshooting, backend analysis, and technical and security support, commonly referred to as Level 2 support, for mission critical technical infrastructure from the server level to the end user interface application in a critical government environment.
Intellectual Property

We believe that our intellectual property is an asset that will contribute to the growth and profitability of our business. We rely on a combination of patented, patent-pending and confidentiality procedures, trademarks and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad. We intend to rely on both registration and common law protection for our trademarks.

In May 2016, we filed a provisional patent application for our proprietary product, Nodeware, and launched it commercially in November 2016. In May 2017, we filed a utility patent application for Nodeware: U.S. Patent No. 10,999,307, was issued on May 4, 2021, for NETWORK ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS AND METHODS THEREOF U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 15/600,297, filed May 19, 2017, claiming priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 62/338,904, filed May 19, 2016. The patent will remain in effect for four years from the date of issue and may be extended for up to twenty years from the filing date. Therefore, the expiration date of the subject patent, assuming all milestones to extend are met, is July 19, 2037.

In December 2019, we filed a second provisional patent application and in December 2020 we filed the subsequent action on the patent on Nodeware. In 2020 and 2021, we created updates and improvements to the platform in response to COVID-19 needs and impact such as a downloadable Windows executable version along with Windows, Mac, and Linux Agents that could be downloaded to a remote PC or server. A number of enhancements related to data management, threat intelligence, and user functionality were part of these updates.

The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. As a result of this uncertainty and overall significance to the financial statements, these costs have been expensed.

The U.S. patent system permits the filing of provisional and non-provisional patent applications. A non-provisional patent application is examined by the United States Patent and Trademark Office and can mature into a patent once that office determines that the claimed invention meets the standards for patentability.

Our current patent and trademark portfolio consists of a patent for the Nodeware solution and process for scanning for vulnerabilities and a pending patent covering the methodologies associated with identifying and cataloging the assets on or across any physical or cloud network, together with a registered trademark for the “Nodeware” name and other trademarks and tradenames associated with our company and products. We intend to continue to work to enhance our intellectual property position on the Nodeware solution and in other appropriate cybersecurity technology we generate.

Research and Development

Our research and development efforts are focused on ensuring our software and services continually adapt to ever-evolving cybersecurity threats, developing new and improved functionality to meet our customers’ needs, and to enable robust and efficient integration with other industry solutions. Our research and development team is responsible for the design, development, testing and quality of our software, including Nodeware, and works to ensure that our software is available, reliable and stable.

We believe the timely development of new features and the enhancement of our existing solution(s) that address continuously evolving cybersecurity risks is essential to maintaining our competitive position. Our research and development team works closely with our channel partners, customers, and internal teams to collect user feedback to enhance our development process to continually incorporate suggestions and feedback. We also believe our research and development teams’ focus on developing new products will help us expand our business and improve our market position. We invest substantial resources in research and development to ensure that the functionalities of Nodeware can be robustly and efficiently integrated with other industry solutions because we believe this is key to our ability to expand the presence of Nodeware and our other software and services in the cybersecurity market. We utilize an agile development process to deliver numerous releases, fixes and feature updates on a regular basis and capitalize qualifying costs of developing larger scale projects. Our research and development team is primarily based in Pittsford, New York, and we maintain additional research and development capabilities in certain other locations who supplement our core team.

In June 2021, we created IGI CyberLabs, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, to support our Nodeware solution and continued software development. CyberLabs's overarching mission is to drive sales of our Nodeware solution, which we believe will drive monthly and annualized recurring revenue. CyberLabs will also drive product and platform enhancements in Nodeware and new cloud and SaaS cybersecurity related products that will be brought to market through our growing direct customer and channel partner relationships. We believe a continued focus on intellectual property development creates differentiation in the market for cybersecurity.

Costs incurred prior to reaching technological feasibility are expensed as incurred, and subsequently they are capitalized until product launch.

Certifications

We possess certifications with our business and technology partners and our technical support personnel maintain a number of relevant certifications and qualifications in certain software applications and in the cybersecurity space. We believe having these certifications and qualifications demonstrates to our channel partners and customers that we have the appropriate level of expertise to support their needs.

We follow standard regulations and standards as part of our ongoing processes: NYS Shield Act, Sarbanes Oxley , National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, and Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) level 4 self-assessment.
Competition

We face competition from many companies in the evolving cybersecurity market. We compete with other MSPs and IT professional services firms who have cybersecurity offerings, MSSPs, and cybersecurity product and software developers operating in the North American market. We have competitors who are both publicly listed and private companies, and that are regional and national in coverage. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staff, sales, and marketing resources, facilities, and experience than we do. We obtain a portion of our business based on proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current clients, who will typically also receive proposals from our competitors. Specifically, Nodeware faces direct competition from companies such as Rapid 7, Qualys, and Tenable in the vulnerability management market.
