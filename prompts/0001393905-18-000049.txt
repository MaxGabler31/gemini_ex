  Our business involves the development of mobile applications for merchant and consumer use. We have two different types of mobile applications, an application designed for consumers (the Vgrab Application) and an application designed for merchants (the Vgrab Merchant Application). We also have an online platform that we are developing to sell online goods (the Vmore Platform), and are working on addition of a new video service portal, Vmore Video, which will focus on filming and supplying HD and 360-degree short videos with an emphasis on sports and extreme sports. In addition, we provide marketing services to merchants including advertising on our website and in our newsletters.   The Vgrab Application: The Vgrab Application is a free mobile voucher application developed for smartphones using the Android and Apple iOS operating systems and allows users to redeem vouchers on their smartphones at a number of retailers and merchants. Users that download the app and sign up for a free Vgrab account will be provided with vouchers for discounts and other promotions on certain products and services. Vgrabs users will have access to an array of exclusive products and/or services that will be available for purchase using accumulated Vgrab points and/or through various e-commerce payment methods. The available products will be tailored - statistically - to a users buying preferences both in proposed variety and value range.  The Vgrab Merchant Application: The Vgrab Merchant Application is a user-friendly mobile application for merchants who wish to advertise their products and services. We provide a platform which enables them to dynamically create and publish their vouchers for products/services all in one single merchant application. The use of vouchers will allow merchants to gain more publicity through distribution of free vouchers to users of Vgrab Application.   The Vmore Platform: The Vmore Platform is an online shopping website in Malaysia. The website is designed to allow merchants to sell their goods to website visitors. Visitors who sign up for a paid membership will have access to an exclusive selection of goods and services. The platform itself, among other technologies, will incorporate geo-targeted advertising and user data statistical analysis, which will enable us to provide our customers with highly personalized content.     -2-    The Vmore Video: Vmore Video is currently in an early development stage. It is being designed as an online video streaming service where viewers from all around the world will be able to upload, search for and view short sports and extreme sports videos in high definition as well as using the latest trend of 360-degree video. With the ever-growing need for social media, Vmore Video will utilize many of the popular social media sites to showcase its business and services, and to drive further traffic to Vgrabs online platform. As additional service, Vmore Video will provide professional editorial services by its newly assembled production team tasked with reviewing uploaded clips and editing the content to improve their quality and content with latest trends as they emerge in todays fast pace world of technology.  Our applications and the platform will be able to connect both consumer and business in a seamless way bringing significant value and exclusivity. By improving Vgrab technology we will be able to filter information about consumer and merchant browsing behavior. This will allow our customers to create and save electronic shopping lists including available to them vouchers without a need to print or cut coupons. In addition, our cloud sharing technology will be able to deliver to our customers and merchants various information packages.   Our primary markets for our products are currently located in Asia, focusing mainly on Malaysia.  During January 2018, our new management team led by Mr. Lim Hun Beng, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer, together with Mr. Liong Fook Weng, the Companys Chief Financial Officer, conducted an overall review of the Companys strategic plans with a view to complement and enhance the current and new business plans and goals.   The management decided that the Company will retain its current core business strategies which comprise Vgrab and Vmore marketing and advertising platforms; in addition, the new management team sees an opportunity to add several additional business units which will allow expanding the current business platforms, directly or through strategic partnerships, to new markets. Some of the markets that the Company is considering are healthy lifestyles and ecommerce, as well as geographical expansion to South East Asia and China. The development of the new business strategies will begin in the second quarter of our Fiscal 2018.   Our Strategy
  Our main strategy is the continued development, improvement, innovation and marketing of our Vgrab mobile applications, software and online merchant platforms (collectively, Vgrab Products). Once development is finished and refined, we will focus on making Vgrab a destination for consumers to find deals on goods and services, as well as interact with each other. Key elements of our strategy include, but are not limited to:  (1) enhancing consumer and merchant experience; (2) marketing our Vgrab Products; (3) global expansion; and (4) becoming the first place consumers look for deals on goods and services.   Our expenditures for the next fiscal year will primarily be associated with the continuous development and testing of our Vgrab Applications and their various elements and functionalities, as well as development and enhancement of the Vmore Platform along with integration of the Vmore Video service. For some specific or highly specialized components, including but not limited to statistical analysis, data protection, software development and web utilization, we may have to seek a top end professional assistance from a third parties both in Malaysia and in the US.  Additional funding will be required in order to start strategic expansion of the current business platforms in accordance with the new strategic plan and the goals introduced by our new Management team.   Distribution
  We will distribute our vouchers to customers primarily through four channels: our mobile platform, our website, email and social media. Our mobile platform consists of mobile apps which we currently offer on iOS and Android devices. We will also provide a website via our Vmore Platform which is available on the world wide web.   -3-   Competition
  The online marketing and voucher industry is a competitive industry. We do not have a strong position in Asia or in Malaysia. We also compete with traditional marketing providers and traditional brick and mortar retailers. Our competitors include companies that have substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than us. Our failure to obtain and maintain a competitive position within the market could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, these laws and regulations may be interpreted differently across domestic and foreign jurisdictions.
