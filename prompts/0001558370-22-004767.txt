Item 1. Business
Overview
Lightning eMotors, Inc. (the “Company”, “Lightning”, “we”, “our” or “us”), is a leading electrification solutions provider committed to enabling the eradication of commercial vehicle emissions, one of the top contributors of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We design and manufacture zero-emission vehicles (“ZEVs”), including battery electric vehicles (“BEV”) and fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEV”), and charging infrastructure solutions for commercial fleets, large enterprises, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and governments. Our product offerings range from Class 3-5 cargo and passenger vehicles and school buses to Class 5 and 6 work trucks, and Class 7 city buses and motorcoaches.

Our customers represent some of the largest global fleet operators and logistics providers in the world, as well as a variety of other large enterprises, OEMs and governments across a variety of commercial vehicle categories. Our customers include DHL Express, Forest River, ABC Companies, California State Hospitals, and Collins Bus. We continue to expand and deepen our customer base as evidenced by our 69 fleet customers who have placed purchase orders, 17 of which have placed repeat orders. As of March 14, 2022, we had $169.3 million of order backlog, which we define as primarily non-binding agreements and purchase orders from customers which can be cancelled or delayed without penalty. 
We started in 2008 as a manufacturer of hybrid systems for commercial vehicles, and in 2017, customer feedback led us to understand that hybrid systems did not adequately address the growing issue of urban air pollution from commercial vehicle fleets. In 2017 we redirected our efforts to focus exclusively on the attractive market opportunity in ZEVs. We leveraged nearly 10 years of extensive knowledge and production infrastructure from developing and implementing hybrid commercial vehicles to successfully adapt to ZEVs. Our 13 year track-record of research and development, significant customer engagement and validation, and focus on building highly customized vehicles has allowed us to create an electric solution that we believe remains ahead of the competition in terms of technology, reliability, and versatility. We believe our modular software, which can be used in multiple platforms and applications, and hardware solution enables us to serve a variety of attractive niche markets in a cost-effective and scalable manner. With over 200 vehicles on the road as of December 31, 2021, we believe we are the only full-range manufacturer of Class 3 to 7 BEV and FCEV in the United States providing end-to-end electrification solutions including advanced analytics software and mobile charging solutions to our customers.
Our manufacturing facility has the capacity to produce 1,500 ZEVs per year on one eight-hour shift. The same facility and equipment can produce 3,000 ZEVs annually by increasing labor to two eight-hour shifts. We believe that with full utilization of our facilities combined with our ability to lease more space on our current campus, and with our OEM customers’ installation capacities, we will be able to scale production to 20,000 vehicle or powertrain units per year. Over the long term, we believe that we will be able to leverage our significant investment in manufacturing capacity to increase production output, leverage our fixed overhead and improve profitability from the sale of our products. In addition, we have also built an ecosystem of supply-chain partners and specialty vehicle partners which are instrumental to our growth.
Based on the recent growth of our sales pipeline and order backlog, we believe the commercial ZEV space is at an inflection point with strong trends of supportive regulation, corporate mandates and government incentives to accelerate the transition to ZEVs globally. In addition, we believe ZEVs already provide a lower total cost of ownership (“TCO”) than internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles with state and federal grants made available to offset the higher upfront cost of commercial ZEVs. We believe that the TCO of ZEVs will continue to decrease as we drive down costs through our research and development efforts, supply chain maturity and scale.
Products and Technologies
We believe our complementary suite of products, software and services are designed to deliver highly reliable and cost-effective solutions to our customers operating vehicles in a wide range of commercial applications. The know-how gathered over the course of our 13-year operating history, combined with the data from our telematics we have aggregated 

4



from every vehicle we have on the road for the last three years, have enabled us to customize our offerings to increase reliability and reduce total cost of ownership, driving repeat purchase behavior across our customer base.

● | Zero-emission Vehicles: Our technology is optimized for ZEVs in Classes 3 to 7, running in urban environments, ranging from medium-duty vans to motorcoaches. Because our software and hardware are modular, we are able to select from our code and hardware libraries to create configurations that suit customers’ needs across a broad category of use applications. Our modular customization strategy allows us to adapt relatively quickly to fulfill large orders with multiple configurations, including both battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, on new and used commercial vehicles.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Zero-Emission Powertrains: In addition to building complete ZEVs, we also design and sell battery electric and fuel cell electric powertrains to our OEM partners, including technology licenses. In the future, we plan to train the OEM technicians on how to install the powertrains within the OEMs’ manufacturing facilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chargers: We sell chargers and energy systems as supporting products to our ZEV customers. There are significant complexities associated with designing, installing and supporting charging infrastructure. We believe that by providing charging infrastructure with the vehicle, we can ensure compatibility and provide the customer with a single point of contact if an issue were to arise. We believe that providing a complete vehicle and charging solution in one source is a competitive advantage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Telematics and Analytics: Our proprietary analytics platform, which is installed in each vehicle and powertrain sold, allows us to collect and optimize drive cycle and vehicle performance data every second (our “1 Hertz analytics solution”). This data provides drivers and fleet operators meaningful real-time recommendations about how to improve vehicle performance, routes, and charging strategies and scale their electric vehicle fleets. Our analytics platform is offered on a subscription basis with all ZEV and powertrain purchases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customers
We sell primarily to large-scale enterprises, making our sales process Business-to-Business focused and our products bespoke to our customers’ needs. Because we work directly with our customers, we are able to assess and meet their needs in a cost-effective manner. We believe our customers choose to partner with us because we are a one-stop shop for ZEVs and charging and energy infrastructure, across Classes 3 to 7 in the United States. We aim to take the complexity out of the EV purchasing process by helping customers to specify the vehicles that suit their individual needs based on our in-depth telematics/analytics while also providing them with charging solutions for their fleets. Our head start in the commercial ZEV space led to significant progress in customer validation with over 200 vehicles on the road and an order backlog of approximately 1,500 units of ZEVs, powertrains and/or charging systems as of March 14, 2022. Our vehicles currently on the road benefit from extensive validation with customers and end-users, ranging between 3 and 30 months, and are deployed in real working conditions, gathering real-time data. Our customers represent some of the largest global fleet operators and logistics providers in the world, as well as a variety of other large enterprises and governments across a variety of commercial vehicle categories. 
We have also developed partnerships with specialty vehicle OEMs, who are critical to our rapid growth strategy and enable us to apply our modular technology to an expanding range of markets including recreational vehicles, ambulances, school buses, coaches, etc. We work closely with partners including Forest River, Rev Group and ABC Companies to electrify vehicles in their target markets that they manufacture. For example, we are the exclusive motorcoach RePower electrification solution provider to ABC Companies, a leading motorcoach distributor in the United States. Our electric RePower solution (replacing ICE with EV in older buses) has an 18-month shorter delivery time and has a compelling TCO advantage compared to many new electric buses and coaches manufactured by other OEMs.
Supply Chain Partners
Since 2008, we have built an ecosystem of supply-chain partners and specialty vehicle partners. Our suppliers are instrumental to the performance and reliability of our vehicles and enable us to scale in a relatively cost-effective manner. Our key suppliers include Ford, Dana, Danfoss, BorgWarner, Hino, ABB, Siemens and Proterra, among others, all of which are industry leading manufacturers of critical components like chassis, bodies, batteries and chargers. Plug Power, a leading hydrogen solution manufacturer, is one of our key supply chain partners with which we have established a multidimensional strategic partnership.

5



We aim to optimize our supply chain for quality, reliability, and cost. We believe our long-term relationships with supply chain partners will be a key driver in our ability to scale without unduly sacrificing quality or delivery times and serve as a foundation for our growth. We are building relationships with multiple suppliers for each core component of our vehicles. 

Sales and Marketing
Our education-focused, technically sophisticated sales force markets and sells a complete range of end-to-end electrification solutions directly to urban commercial fleets, which include commercial ZEVs, powertrains and charging services. 
Research and Development 
Our primary areas of focus for research and development include, but are not limited to (i) ZEV development and system integration; (ii) software and algorithms for our electrification solutions; (iii) data analytics; (iv) accelerated lifetime testing processes to improve reliability, maintainability and system-level robustness; (v) sub-systems enhancement; and (vi) mobile charging solutions. 
Intellectual Property (“IP”)
We protect our growing intellectual property portfolio through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. Unpatented research, development, know-how, and engineering skills make a vital contribution to our business, and we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property. While we currently are in the process of applying for patent protection for some of our inventions, trade-secrets, particularly with respect to our software, are our primary form of IP protection. We regularly review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications as we consider appropriate under the circumstances relating to the new technologies that we develop. 
Government Regulations and Incentives
In the automotive space in which we operate, we are subject to numerous regulations. A brief summary of material government and environmental regulations and incentives is set forth below. 
Motor Vehicle Safety 
Our vehicles are subject to compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and other regulatory obligations established by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). Lightning is a registered USDOT Intermediate Stage Manufacturer, Final Stage Manufacturer, Incomplete Vehicle Manufacturer, and Vehicle Alterer. Any chassis or body modifications performed by us must be designed, manufactured, and tested to ensure that the final ZEV remains certified to meet all FMVSS when deployed to the customer, including crash-worthiness requirements, crash-avoidance requirements, and ZEV-specific requirements, as well as, bumper standards and theft prevention standards affected by the alterations. Failure to comply with safety regulations could result in substantial adverse impact to the Company. These could include recalls, loss of USDOT registration, judicial enforcement, civil liability and reputational harm. 
EPA and CARB Emissions Compliance and Certification 
Under the U.S. Clean Air Act, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and powertrains are required to obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA, and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). This regulatory process is designed to ensure that all vehicles comply with applicable emission standards for both criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and particulate matter (“PM”), and greenhouse gases (“GHG”), such as CO2 and nitrous oxide (“N2O”). A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in all states, and an Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in California and states that have adopted the California standards. CARB sets more stringent standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California and must obtain a waiver of preemption from the EPA before implementing and enforcing such standards. California’s waiver of preemption with regard to GHG emission standards is currently the subject of legal challenges, and the authority of 

6



California to implement and enforce GHG emission standards for vehicles and engines in the future is uncertain. Currently, states that have adopted the California standards, as approved by the EPA, also require a CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles in those states. There are currently fourteen additional states (in addition to the District of Columbia) that have adopted the California emissions standard for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. In these states, an EPA Certificate of Conformity and CARB Executive Order must be obtained for each model year for each class of vehicle. Failure to obtain or comply with the terms of a Certificate of Conformity or Executive Order is subject to civil penalty and administrative or judicial enforcement. We currently utilize EPA certified chassis from major OEM’s (meaning that we do not require an alternative fuel vehicle certification from the EPA for our ZEV’s), and maintain five active CARB EOs for model year 2021. 
Pursuant to its authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA adopted Phase 1 fuel efficiency and GHG standards for medium-duty vehicles and engines on September 15, 2011. The EPA adopted more stringent fuel efficiency and GHG standards for medium-duty vehicles and engines on October 25, 2016. Manufacturers of vehicles and engines may comply with the GHG standards by selling increasing percentages of ZEVs. CARB also has adopted GHG and fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. The Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) Regulation approved by CARB in June 2020 requires medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers to produce and offer for sale in California increasing numbers of ZEVs. These regulatory standards increase annually beginning in 2024, and will require that 30%-50% of new truck sales in California (depending on Class) be ZEVs by 2030, and 55%-75% (depending on Class) be ZEVs by 2035. 
CARB projects that the ACT regulation will result in sales of approximately 30,000 ZEVs by 2027, approximately 100,000 by 2030, and more than 250,000 by 2035. Offset credits for early production of heavy-duty ZEVs became available in model year 2021. We registered for these credits which can be banked and sold to truck OEMs that are not in compliance with the ACT regulation for a period of 5 years.
Additional CARB regulations mandating ZEV deployment in specific vocations are in various stages of development or implementation. These include the Zero Emission Fleet Rule, Innovative Clean Transit Regulation, and the Zero Emission Airport Shuttle Regulation. We expect these or similar programs to be put in place over the next decade. 
Receipt of an EPA Certificate of Conformity and CARB Executive Order obligates the holder to ensure that the covered engine or vehicle is capable of complying with applicable standards throughout the full useful life of the product, which for medium-duty vehicles may be ten years or from 120,000 to 185,000 miles, whichever comes first and depending on the engine and vehicle size. Emissions control system warranty coverage must be provided for a period of five years or 50,000 to 100,000 miles (CARB warranty obligations increasing to up to 110,000, 150,000 and 350,000 miles in 2022), whichever comes first and depending on the engine and vehicle size. During this time, manufacturers must repair emission-related defects at no cost to the customer. Throughout the full useful life of the engine or vehicle, manufacturers are required to remedy in-use problems that cause engines or vehicles to exceed emission standards for criteria pollutants or GHGs.
Manufacturers may have to conduct recalls, service campaigns or other field actions, or provide extended warranties to address any such in-use issues that may arise. The EPA is considering extending the warranty period, including by adopting the CARB warranty obligations of 110,000, 150,000, or 350,000 miles, depending on the engine size. Manufacturers of medium-duty engines and vehicles also must ensure that their products comply with On Board Diagnostics (“OBD”) requirements. The OBD system is intended to identify and diagnose malfunctions within the engine, aftertreatment and emission control systems and alert the driver to the underlying issue so the vehicle can be brought in for service. CARB issues approval of the OBD system as part of its issuance of an Executive Order; the EPA deems demonstration of compliance with CARB OBD requirements to satisfy the EPA’s requirements. As with emissions compliance, manufacturers are required to ensure that the OBD system functions as designed and is able to identify component malfunctions throughout the full useful life of the vehicle or engine.
Many customers of EVs utilize state and Federal incentive programs to offset the higher initial costs of electric vehicles. Our customers have historically leveraged the California Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”) as well as Volkswagen Emissions Mitigation Trust Fund (“VW EMTF”) funding that is allocated to each state to purchase our vehicles and charging systems. The HVIP program, which California has allocated approximately $235 million in 2021, represents the most utilized of the subsidy programs to our customers due to its ease of access and amount of funding per vehicle (approximately 30% of a Lightning Systems FT3-43/86 Cargo Van). For the year ended 

7



December 31, 2021, we derived approximately 11% of our revenue from HVIP funding. Of the order backlog as of March 14, 2022, which is primarily comprised of non-binding agreements and purchase orders, approximately 28% of the orders by volume, and approximately 35% of the orders by value, had contingencies for 2021 HVIP funding that have not yet been satisfied and may not be secured. Any material problem with the HVIP program or delays in payment by the HVIP program for 2021 or 2022 could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Dislocations under the HVIP in June 2021 and August 2021, whereby the demand exceeded the availability of funds, caused delays in our customer’s ability to receive sufficient funding under the HVIP for their orders. See “Risk Factors — We may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply, and our customers could fail to effectively execute on governmental funding programs, including HVIP, which potentially represents a large portion of our revenues” for more information. 
Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credits (“LCFS”)
California adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in 2009 and began implementation in 2011. A comparable agency in Oregon and Washington adopted the similar Clean Fuels Program. Other states have proposed similar clean fuels programs, or are conducting initial studies at present. In 2018, the LCFS program introduced significant new LCFS credit mechanisms in connection with deployment of ZEV infrastructure.
LCFS credits for charging infrastructure are specifically tied to the owner/operator of the electric vehicle supply equipment (“EVSE”), which gives Lightning eMotors the incentive to grow the charging rental business model. There is no regulatory limit to the number of credits which can be accumulated and banked. Credit deficits under the LCFS have frequently exceeded credit generation since 2017, and there continues to be significant (and growing) requirements for producers of fossil fuels to offset the carbon intensity of their fuels. LCFS credit demand is expected to continue to grow as regulatory carbon intensity benchmark requirements already in place mandated increases from 7.5% reduction in 2020 to 20% reduction by 2030. 
GHG Credits—U.S. EPA
The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule requires all manufacturers of medium-duty engines and vehicles to comply with fleet average GHG standards. Manufacturers may comply with the standards by producing engines or vehicles, all of which comply with the standards, or by averaging, banking and trading GHG credits within vehicle or engine categories. Manufacturers may also comply with GHG standards by purchasing credits from manufacturers with a surplus of credits. The failure to comply with GHG standards can lead to civil penalties or the voiding of a manufacturer’s EPA Certificate of Conformity. In connection with the delivery and placement into service of zero-emission and low-emission vehicles, we may earn tradable GHG credits that can be sold to other manufacturers. Under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, plug-in hybrid, all-electric and fuel cell vehicles earn a credit multiplier of 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5, respectively, for use in the calculation of GHG emission credits. 
Commercial engine and vehicle manufacturers are required to meet the NOx emission standard for each type of engine or vehicle produced. Typical diesel engine emission control technology limits the fuel economy and GHG improvements that can be made while maintaining compliance with the NOx standard. As the fleet average GHG standards continue to decrease over time, compliance with the NOx standard may increase the difficulty for conventional diesel vehicles to meet the applicable GHG standards. Accordingly, manufacturers of diesel trucks may need to purchase GHG credits to cover their emission deficit. The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule provides the opportunity for the sale of excess credits to other manufacturers who require such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the regulation currently does not limit the number of GHG credits sold within the same commercial vehicle categories. 
GHG Credits—California Air Resources Board 
California also has a GHG emissions regulatory program that is similar to the EPA requirements. Like the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule, the CARB rule allows for averaging, banking and trading of credits to comply with the fleet-average GHG standard and the failure to comply with the California GHG standard may lead to the imposition of civil penalties. The delivery and placement into service of our zero-emission vehicles in California may earn us tradable credits that can be sold. Under CARB GHG regulations, advanced technology vehicles also earn a credit multiplier of for use in the calculation of emission credits in the same amounts as under the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Rule.

Examples of other existing or potential future incentives and grant programs that either we or our customers can apply for include: 

● | LCFS. California was the first jurisdiction to develop an LCFS, and similar LCFS programs may be adopted by other jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. The goal of an LCFS is to reduce the well-to-wheel carbon intensity of fuels by providing both mandated reduction targets as well as bankable and tradable credits.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Purchase Incentives. Both California and New York have active programs that provide “cash on the hood” incentives to customers that purchase zero-emission vehicles. Other states are considering developing similar programs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grant Programs. Government entities at all levels from federal, including the U.S. Department of Energy, state (for example, CARB) and local (for example, North Texas Council of Governments), have grant programs designed to increase and accelerate the development and deployment of ZEVs and charging or fueling infrastructure technologies. There is currently several billion dollars of VW EMTF funding available to states for eligible mitigation actions, including incentives to purchase or retrofit low-or-zero emissions vehicles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | EPA Smartway. The EPA Smartway program provides grants and funding for the retrofit of medium-duty vehicles with components and technologies that reduce emissions. Drivers and fleet owners who repower vehicles with advanced technology powertrains may be able to access funding to offset a portion of the cost.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
As the penetration of electric commercial vehicles in the market is currently well under 1%, we believe that our primary competition today is with legacy OEM ICE-based vehicles. As the ZEV regulatory requirements accelerate over the next several years, and as the TCO of electric vehicles versus ICE vehicles continues to improve, we expect to face more competition from manufacturers of electric commercial vehicles. There are both traditional automotive OEMs and an increasing number of newer companies that have announced offerings of commercial electric and/or fuel cell vehicles. We currently have limited competitors in the medium-duty electric vocational truck and shuttle bus space, including GreenPower Motor Company, XL Fleet, XOS Trucks, Sea Electric, Workhorse and Motiv. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets are talent and culture, technological innovation, product performance and quality, product availability, customization options, service options, customer experience, brand differentiation, product design and style, pricing and TCO, and manufacturing scale and efficiency. We believe that we have a head start and compete efficiently with our competitors (including the large OEMs) on the basis of these factors; however, our current and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their electric commercial fleet programs. Additionally, our competitors may also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, more traditional sales and distribution strategies, broader customer and industry relationships and other tangible and intangible resources than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the EV market may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
Human Capital 
Our employees are critical to our success. As of March 14, 2022, we had 205 full-time employees and 29 contractors. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union. 
We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce and are committed to a culture which values equality and respect. Our employees are offered competitive compensation and benefits programs, as well as opportunities for career growth and development. We are committed to a safe workplace and an ethical environment in which employees can continually develop their skills and expertise to advance their careers.
Formation
On May 6, 2021 (the "Closing Date"), GigCapital3, Inc. ("Gig"), consummated the previously announced merger pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, dated December 10, 2020 (the "Business Combination Agreement"), by and among Project Power Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gig incorporated in the State of Delaware ("Merger 

9



Sub"), and Lightning Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Lightning Systems"). Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between Gig and Lightning Systems was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Lightning Systems, with Lightning Systems surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gig (the "Business Combination").
On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Gig changed its name to Lightning eMotors, Inc. Lightning Systems was deemed the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination based on an analysis of the criteria outlined in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations. This determination was primarily based on Lightning Systems’ stockholders prior to the Business Combination having a majority of the voting interests in the combined company, with Lightning Systems’ operations comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company and Lightning Systems senior management comprising the senior management of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Lightning Systems issuing stock for the net assets of Gig, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Gig are stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
While Gig was the legal acquirer in the Business Combination, Lightning Systems was deemed the accounting acquirer. Therefore, the historical financial statements of Lightning Systems became the historical financial statements of the combined company, upon the consummation of the Business Combination. As a result, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Lightning Systems prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Company and Lightning Systems following the closing of the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Lightning Systems at their historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity structure for all periods presented.
In accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparative periods up to the Closing Date, to reflect the number of shares of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ("Common Stock") issued to Lightning Systems stockholders in connection with the recapitalization transaction. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to Lightning Systems redeemable convertible preferred stock and Lightning Systems common stock prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio of approximately 0.9406 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) established in the Business Combination Agreement. Activity within the statement of stockholders' equity for the issuances and repurchases of Lightning Systems convertible redeemable preferred stock, were also retroactively converted to Lightning Systems common stock. For more details on the reverse recapitalization, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
