 ﻿
 Our Business
 ﻿
 We are a leading vacation ownership company that markets and sells VOIs and manages resorts in top leisure and urban destinations. Our resort network includes 45 Club Resorts (resorts in which owners in the Bluegreen Vacation Club (“Vacation Club”) have the right to use most of the units in connection with their VOI ownership) and 24 Club Associate Resorts (resorts in which owners in our Vacation Club have the right to use a limited number of units in connection with their VOI ownership). Our Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts are primarily located in popular, high-volume, “drive-to” vacation locations, including Orlando, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach and Charleston, among others. Through our points-based system, the approximately 216,000 owners in our Vacation Club have the flexibility to stay at units available at any of our resorts and have access to over 11,000 other hotels and resorts through partnerships and exchange networks. We have a robust sales and marketing platform supported by exclusive marketing relationships with nationally-recognized consumer brands, such as Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. These marketing relationships drive sales within our core demographic, which is described below.
 ﻿
 Prior to 2009, our vacation ownership business consisted solely of the sale of VOIs in resorts that we had developed or acquired (“developed VOI sales”). While we continue to conduct such sales and development activities, we now also derive a significant portion of our revenue from our capital-light business model, which utilizes our expertise and infrastructure to generate both VOI sales and recurring revenue from third parties without the significant capital investment generally associated with the development and acquisition of resorts. Our capital-light business activities include sales of VOIs owned by third-party developers pursuant to which we are paid a commission (“fee-based sales”) and sales of VOIs that we purchase under just-in-time (“JIT”) arrangements with third-party developers or from secondary market sources. In addition, we provide resorts and resort developers with other fee-based services, including resort management, mortgage servicing, title services and construction management. We also offer financing to qualified VOI purchasers, which generates significant interest income.

  ﻿
 Our Vacation Club has grown from approximately 170,000 owners as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 216,000 owners as of December 31, 2018. We primarily serve a demographic we consider underpenetrated within the vacation ownership industry, as the typical Vacation Club owner has an average annual household income of approximately $77,000 as compared to an industry average of $86,000. According to U.S. census data, households with an annual income of $50,000 to $100,000 represent the largest percentage of the total population (approximately 29%). We

believe our ability to effectively scale our transaction size to suit our customer, as well as our high-quality, conveniently-located, “drive-to” resorts are attractive to our core target demographic. 
 ﻿
 Our History
 ﻿
 We were organized in 1985 as a Massachusetts corporation named Patten Corporation, primarily focused on retail land sales to consumers. In 1994, we entered into the vacation ownership industry. In 1996, we changed our name to Bluegreen Corporation. From 1986 through April 2, 2013, our common stock was publicly listed and traded on the NYSE. On April 2, 2013, Woodbridge Holdings, LLC (“Woodbridge”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BBX Capital, acquired all of the shares of our common stock not previously owned by it, and we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodbridge. BBX Capital (NYSE: BBX) is a Florida-based publicly traded diversified holding company. On March 10, 2014, we were redomiciled from a Massachusetts corporation to a Florida corporation. On September 25, 2017, we changed our name to Bluegreen Vacations Corporation.
 ﻿
 On November 17, 2017, we consummated the initial public offering of our common stock.  In the initial public offering, we sold 3,736,723 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $14.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions, and BBX Capital, as selling shareholder, sold 3,736,722 shares of our common stock, including 974,797 shares sold on December 5, 2017 pursuant to the underwriters exercise of its option to purchase additional shares, at the public offering price of $14.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. BBX Capital continues to own approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE on November 17, 2017 under the symbol “BXG.”
 ﻿
 Our Reportable Segments
 ﻿
 We report our results of operations through two reportable segments: (i) Sales of VOIs and financing; (ii) resort operations and club management. 
 ﻿
 Our sales of VOIs and financing segment includes our marketing and sales activities related to the VOIs that we own, our sale of VOIs through fee-for-service arrangements with third-party developers, our provision of consumer financing in connection with sales of VOIs that we own, and our provision of title services through a wholly-owned subsidiary.
 ﻿
 Our resort operations and club management includes our provision of management services to our Vacation Club and to a majority of the homeowners associations (“HOAs”) of the resorts within our Vacation Club. In connection with those services, we also provide club reservation services, services to owners and billing and collections services to our Vacation Club and certain HOAs. Additionally, we generate revenue within our resort operations and club management section from our Traveler Plus program, food and beverage and other retail operations, our provision of rental services to third parties, and our management of construction activities of certain of our fee-based clients.
 ﻿
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 16: Segment Reporting to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our reportable segments.    ﻿
 Our Products
 ﻿
 Vacation Ownership Interests
 ﻿
 Since entering the vacation ownership industry in 1994, we have generated over 669,000 VOI sales transactions, including over 147,000 fee-based sales transactions. Our Vacation Club owners receive an annual or biennial allotment of “points” in perpetuity (supported by an underlying deeded VOI held in trust for the owner) that may be used to stay at any of our 45 Club Resorts and 24 Club Associate Resorts. Vacation Club owners can use their points to stay in resorts for varying lengths of time, starting at a minimum of two nights. The number of points required for a stay at a resort varies depending on a variety of factors, including resort location, size of the unit, vacation season and the days of the week. Under this system, Vacation Club owners can select vacations according to their schedules, space needs and available points. Subject to certain restrictions and fees, Vacation Club owners are typically allowed to carry over any unused points for one year and to “borrow” points from the next year. Vacation Club owners may also 

 
7

take advantage of various other lodging and vacation opportunities available to them as described under “Value Proposition” below.
 ﻿
 Each of our Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts is managed by an HOA, which is governed by a board of directors or trustees. This board hires a management company to which it delegates many of the rights and responsibilities of the HOA, including landscaping, security, housekeeping, garbage collection, utilities, insurance procurement, laundry and repairs and maintenance. Vacation Club owners pay annual maintenance fees which cover the costs of operating all the resorts in the Vacation Club system, including fees for real estate taxes and reserves for capital improvements. If a Vacation Club owner does not pay such charges, his or her use rights may be suspended and ultimately terminated, subject to the applicable lender’s first mortgage lien, if any, on such owner’s VOI. We provide management services to 49 resorts and the Vacation Club through contractual arrangements with HOAs. We have a 100% renewal rate on management contracts from our Club Resorts.
 ﻿
 “Value Proposition”
 ﻿
 Our Vacation Club’s points-based platform offers owners significant flexibility. As reflected in the chart below, basic Vacation Club ownership entitles owners to use their points to stay at any of our 45 Club Resorts and 24 Club Associate Resorts, as well as to access more than 4,300 resorts available through the Resort Condominiums International, LLC (“RCI”) exchange network. For a nominal annual fee and transaction fees, Vacation Club owners can join and utilize our Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use their points to access an additional 48 direct exchange resorts, and other vacation experiences, such as cruises.  Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points. Choice Privileges points can be used for stays in Choice Hotels. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays in Choice Hotels’ Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Latin America. Overall, there are approximately 6,900 hotels in the Choice Hotels network, located in more than 40 countries and territories, and Choice Hotels’ brands include the Ascend Hotel Collection, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality, Sleep Inn, Clarion, Cambria Hotels and Suites, MainStay Suites, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Econo Lodge and Rodeway Inn. We continuously seek new ways to add value for our Vacation Club owners, including enhanced product offerings, new resort locations, broader vacation experiences and further technological innovation, all of which are designed to increase guest satisfaction.

 Approximately 66% of Vacation Club owners are enrolled in Traveler Plus. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 8% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network.
 ﻿
 Vacation Club Resort Locations and Amenities
 ﻿
 As shown in the map below, our Vacation Club resorts are primarily located on the U.S. East Coast and Midwest. The 48 direct-exchange resorts available to Traveler Plus members are concentrated along the West Coast and Hawaii. Together, this provides a broad offering across the United States and the Caribbean.
 ﻿

 ﻿
 Vacation Club resorts are primarily “drive-to” resort destinations and approximately 89% of our Vacation Club owners live within a four-hour drive of at least one of our resorts.  Our resorts are located in popular vacation destinations, such as Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, and Nevada, and represent a diverse mix of resort and urban destinations, allowing Vacation Club owners the ability to customize their vacation experience.  In addition, we offer our Vacation Club owners access to Caribbean locations, including Aruba.
 ﻿
 Our resort network offers a diverse mix of experiences and accommodations.  Unlike some of our competitors that maintain static brand design standards across resorts and geographies, we seek to design resorts that capture the uniqueness of a particular location. Our distinctive resorts are designed to create an authentic experience and connection to their unique and varied locations.
 ﻿
 Our resorts typically feature condominium-style accommodations with amenities such as fully equipped kitchens, entertainment centers and in-room laundry facilities. Many resorts feature a clubhouse (including a pool, game room, lounge), hotel-type staff and concierge services.
 ﻿
 We also own a 51% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, which develops, markets and sells VOIs at three premier wilderness-themed resorts adjacent to Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri: The Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar, The Cliffs at Long Creek and Paradise Point. The remaining 49% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations is held by Big Cedar, LLC (“BC LLC”), an affiliate of Bass Pro. As a result of our controlling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations.
 ﻿
 Located next to Big Cedar Lodge, The Bluegreen Wilderness Club is a 40-acre resort overlooking Table Rock Lake with sprawling views of the surrounding Ozarks. Vacation Club owners enjoy a variety of amenities, including a 9,000 square foot clubhouse, lazy river and rock-climbing wall, in addition to full access to the amenities and activities of Big Cedar Lodge.  The Cliffs at Long Creek offers fully furnished homes that can accommodate up to 13 people and 

 
10

other vacation villas while providing access to a clubhouse and amenities at The Bluegreen Wilderness Club.  Paradise Point offers spacious vacation villas with direct access to Table Rock Lake and the Bass Pro Long Creek Marina.

 Marketing and Sale of Inventory
 ﻿
 VOI sales are typically generated by attracting prospective customers to tour a resort and attend a sales presentation. Our sales and marketing platform utilizes a variety of methods to generate new owner prospects, drive tour flow and sell VOIs in our Vacation Club. We utilize marketing alliances with nationally-recognized brands, which provide exclusive access to venues which target consumers generally matching our core demographic. In addition, we source sales prospects through programs which generate leads at high-traffic venues and in high-density tourist locations and events, as well as from telemarketing and referrals from existing owners and exchangers and renters staying at our properties.
 ﻿
 Many of our programs involve the sale of a discounted vacation package that typically includes a two to three night stay in close proximity to one of our resort sales offices and requires participation in a sales presentation (a sales tour). Vacation packages are typically sold either in retail establishments, such as Bass Pro stores and outlet malls, or via telemarketing. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold over 227,000 vacation packages and 48% of our VOI sales were derived from vacation packages. As of December 31, 2018, we had a pipeline of over 185,000 vacation packages sold, which typically convert to tours at a rate of 55%.
 ﻿
 We have an exclusive marketing agreement with Bass Pro, a nationally-recognized retailer of fishing, marine, hunting, camping and sports gear, that provides us with the right to market and sell vacation packages at kiosks in each of Bass Pro’s retail locations. As of December 31, 2018, we sold vacation packages in 69 of Bass Pro’s stores. Bass Pro has a loyal customer base that strongly matches our core demographic. Under the agreement, we also have the right to 

 
12

market VOIs in Bass Pro catalogs and on its website, and to access Bass Pro’s customer database. In exchange, we compensate Bass Pro based on VOI sales generated through the program. No compensation is paid to Bass Pro under the agreement on sales made at Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations’ resorts. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by the agreement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 14%, 15% and 16%, respectively, of our VOI sales volume. Our marketing alliance with Bass Pro originated in 2000, has been renewed twice and currently runs through 2025. We have continued to meet with Bass Pro’s leadership in an effort to resolve the issues which arose between the parties in 2017 and 2018. While there is no assurance that a resolution will be reached, we remain optimistic that we will achieve a resolution of the outstanding issues. We are hopeful that the resolution will address the timing of entry into the Cabela’s stores and an extension of the parties’ agreements. If reached, the resolution may include a restructuring of the amount and timing of compensation paid to Bass Pro. In the meantime, we continue to execute our vacation package marketing strategy under our current agreement with Bass Pro. While we do not believe that any material additional amounts are due to Bass Pro, our future results would be impacted if the issues are not resolved and by any change in the compensation payable to Bass Pro or the calculation of payments or reimbursements utilized pursuant to the agreements.
 ﻿
 We also have an exclusive strategic relationship with Choice Hotels that covers several areas of our business, including a sales and marketing alliance that enables us to leverage Choice Hotels’ brands, customer relationships and marketing channels to sell vacation packages. Vacation packages are sold through customer reservation calls transferred to us from Choice and through outbound telemarketing methods utilizing Choice’s customer database. In addition, 37 of our resorts are part of Choice’s Ascend Hotel Collection, which provides us with the opportunity to market to Choice Hotel guests staying at our resorts. Our strategic relationship with Choice Hotels originated in 2013 and was extended in August 2017 for a term of 15 years, with an additional 15-year renewal term thereafter unless either party elects not to renew the arrangement.
 ﻿
 In addition, we generate leads and sell vacation packages through our relationships with various other retail operators and entertainment providers. As of December 31, 2018, we had kiosks in 21 outlet malls, strategically selected based on proximity to major vacation destinations and strong foot traffic of consumers matching our core target demographic. We generate vacation package sales from these kiosks. We also generate leads at malls, outlets and high-density locations or events, where contact information for sales prospects is obtained through raffles, giveaways and other attractions. We then seek to sell vacation packages to such prospects, including through telemarketing efforts by us or third-party vendors. As of December 31, 2018, we had lead generation operations in over 460 locations.
 ﻿
 We believe that our diverse strategic marketing alliances (including those with Bass Pro, Choice Hotels and other retail operators and entertainment providers) deliver a strategic advantage over certain competitors that rely primarily on relationships with their affiliated hotel brands to drive lead generation and new owner growth. Our goal is to identify marketing partners with brands that attract our targeted owner demographic and to build successful marketing relationships with those partners. We also attempt to structure our marketing alliances to compensate our partners with success-based payments, rather than flat fees for the use of their brand or facilities for lead generation. We believe that the variety in our marketing relationships has facilitated a healthy mix of new owner sales vs. existing owner sales that compare favorably to our competitors. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 48% of our VOI sales were to new owners.
 ﻿
 In addition to attracting new customers, we also seek to sell additional VOI points to our existing Vacation Club owners. These sales generally have lower marketing costs and result in higher operating margins than sales generated through other marketing channels. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 sales to existing Vacation Club owners accounted for 52%, 49% and 46%, respectively, of our system-wide sales of VOIs. We target a balanced mix of new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales to drive sustainable long-term growth. The number of owners in our Vacation Club has increased at a 5% CAGR between 2012 and 2018, from approximately 170,000 owners as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 216,000 owners as of December 31, 2018. 
 ﻿
 We operate 26 sales offices, typically located adjacent to our resorts and staffed with sales representatives and sales managers. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 3,000 employees dedicated to VOI sales and marketing.  We utilize a uniform sales process, offer ongoing training for our sales personnel and maintain strict quality control policies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 91% of our sales were generated from 17 of our sales offices, which focus on both new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales. Our remaining 9 sales offices are primarily focused 

 
13

on sales to existing Vacation Club owners staying at the respective resort. In addition, we utilize our telesales operations to sell additional VOIs to Vacation Club owners. 
 ﻿
 Flexible Business Model
 ﻿
 Our business model is designed to give us flexibility to capitalize on opportunities and adapt to changing market environments. We have the ability to adjust our targeted mix of capital-light vs. developed VOI sales, sales to new customers vs. existing Vacation Club owners, and cash vs. financed sales. While we may pursue opportunities that impact our short-term results, our long-term goal is to achieve sustained growth while maximizing earnings and cash flow. 

 ﻿
 ﻿
 Note: Cash sales represent the portion of our system-wide sales of VOIs that is received from the customer in cash within 30 days of purchase.
 ﻿
 VOI Sales Mix
 ﻿
 Our VOI sales include:
 ﻿

· | Fee-based sales of VOIs owned by third-party developers pursuant to which we are paid a commission;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | JIT sales of VOIs we acquire from third-party developers in close proximity to when we intend to sell such VOIs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Secondary market sales of VOIs we acquire from HOAs or other owners; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Developed VOI sales, or sales of VOIs in resorts that we develop or acquire (excluding inventory acquired pursuant to JIT and secondary market arrangements).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

 ﻿
 Fee-Based Sales
 ﻿
 We offer sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a commission. Under these fee-based sales arrangements, which are typically entered into on a non-committed basis, we sell the third-party developers’ VOIs as Vacation Club interests through our sales and marketing platform. We also provide third-party developers with administrative services, periodic reporting and analytics through our proprietary software platform. We seek to structure the fee for these services to cover selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Historically we have targeted a commission rate of 65% to 75% of the VOI sales price. Notes receivable originated in connection with fee-based sales are held by the third-party developer and, in certain cases, are serviced by us for an additional fee.  In connection with fee-based sales, we are not at risk for development financing and have no capital requirements, thereby increasing return on invested capital, or ROIC.  We also typically hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.
 ﻿
 Just-In-Time (JIT) Sales
 ﻿
 We enter into JIT inventory acquisition agreements with third-party developers that allow us to buy VOI inventory in close proximity to when we intend to sell such VOIs. While we typically enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, we may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Similar to fee-based sales, JIT sales do not expose us to risk for development financing. However, unlike fee-based sales, we hold the consumer finance receivables originated in connection with JIT sales. While JIT sales accounted for only 5% of system-wide sales of VOIs for the year ended December 31, 2018, JIT arrangements are often entered into in connection with fee-based sales arrangements. We also typically hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.
 ﻿
 Secondary Market Sales
 ﻿
 We acquire VOI inventory from HOAs and other owners generally on a non-committed basis. These VOIs are typically obtained by the applicable HOA through foreclosure or termination in connection with HOA maintenance fee defaults. Accordingly, we generally purchase VOIs from secondary market sources at a greater discount to retail price compared to developed VOI sales and JIT sales. During the year ended December 31, 2018, secondary market sales accounted for 19% of our system-wide sales of VOIs.
 ﻿


 
15

Developed VOI Sales
 ﻿
 Developed VOI sales are sales of VOIs in resorts that we have developed or acquired (excluding inventory acquired pursuant to JIT and secondary market arrangements). During the year ended December 31, 2018, developed VOI sales accounted for 25% of our system-wide sales of VOIs. We hold the notes receivable originated in connection with developed VOI sales. We also typically obtain the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.
 ﻿
 Future VOI Sales
 ﻿
 Completed VOI inventory increases or decreases from period to period due to the acquisition of inventory through JIT and secondary market arrangements, development of new VOI units, reacquisition of VOIs through notes receivable defaults and changes to sales prices and completed sales. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we owned completed VOI inventory (excluding units not currently being marketed as VOIs, such as model units) and had access to additional completed VOI inventory through fee-based and JIT arrangements as follows (dollars are in thousands and represent the then-estimated retail sales value):

  ﻿
 Based on current estimates and expectations, we believe this inventory, combined with inventory being developed by us or our third-party developer clients, and inventory that we may reacquire in connection with mortgage and maintenance fee defaults, can support our VOI sales at our current levels for over four years. We maintain relationships with numerous third-party developers and expect additional fee-based and JIT relationships to continue to provide high-quality VOI inventory to support our sales efforts. In addition, we are focused on strategically expanding our inventory through development at three of our resorts over the next several years. We intend to continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire VOI inventory in key strategic markets where we identify growing demand and have already established marketing and sales networks.
 ﻿
 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the estimated retail sales value and cash purchase price of the VOIs we acquired through secondary market arrangements were as follows (dollars in thousands):

  ﻿
 In addition to inventory acquired through secondary market arrangements and in connection with notes receivable defaults, we expect to acquire inventory through five JIT arrangements during 2019, three of which provide for committed purchases for 2019, and development activities. Development activities currently consist primarily of additional VOI units being developed at The Cliffs at Long Creek and The Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar in Ridgedale, Missouri, and at the Fountains in Orlando, Florida.
 ﻿
 Management and Other Fee-Based Services
 ﻿
 We earn recurring management fees for providing services to HOAs. These management services include oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance and certain accounting and administrative functions. We believe our management contracts yield highly predictable cash flows that do not have the traditional risks associated with hotel management contracts that are linked to daily rate or occupancy. Our management contracts are typically structured as “cost-plus” management fees, which means we generally earn fees equal to 10% to 12% of the costs to operate the applicable resort and have an initial term of three years with automatic one-year renewals. As of December 31, 2018, 

 
16

we provided management services to 49 resorts. We also earn recurring management fees for providing services to the Vacation Club. These services include managing the reservation system and providing owner billing and collection services. Our management contract with the Vacation Club provides for reimbursement of our costs plus a fee equal to $10 per VOI owner. We may seek to expand our management services business, including to provide hospitality management services to hotels for third parties.
 ﻿
 In addition to HOA and club management services, which provide a recurring stream of revenue, we provide other fee-based services that produce revenue without the significant capital investment generally associated with the development and acquisition of resorts. These services include, but are not limited to, title and escrow services for fees in connection with the closing of VOI sales, servicing notes receivable held by third parties, typically for a fee equal to 1.5% to 2.5% of the principal balance of the serviced portfolio, and construction management services for third-party developers, typically for fees equal to 4% of the cost of construction of the project. We also receive revenue from retail and food and beverage outlets at certain resorts.
 ﻿
 Customer Financing
 ﻿
 We generally offer qualified purchasers financing for up to 90% of the purchase price of VOIs. The typical financing provides for a term of ten years, a fixed interest rate that is determined by the FICO score of the borrower and the amount of the down payment and existing ownership, is fully amortizing in equal installments, and may be prepaid without penalty. Purchasers may receive an additional 1% discount on the interest rate by participating in our pre-authorized payment plan. As of December 31, 2018, 95% of our serviced VOI notes receivable participated in our pre-authorized payment plan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate on our VOI notes receivable was 15.1%.    ﻿
 VOI purchasers are generally required to make a down payment of at least 10% of the sales price. As part of our continued efforts to manage operating cash flows, we incentivize our sales associates to encourage cash sales and higher down payments on financed sales, with a target of 40-45% of the VOI sales price collected in cash. We also promote a point-of-sale credit card program sponsored by a third-party financial institution. As a result of these efforts, we have increased both the percentage of sales that are fully paid in cash and the average down payment on financed sales. Including down payments received on financed sales, approximately 42% of our system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2018 were paid in cash within approximately 30 days from the contract date.
 ﻿
 See “Sales/Financing of Receivables” below for additional information regarding our receivable financing activities.
 ﻿
 Loan Underwriting
 ﻿
 We generally do not originate financing to customers with FICO scores below 575. However, we may provide financing to customers with no FICO score if the customer makes a minimum down payment of 20%. For loans made during 2018, the borrowers’ weighted-average FICO score after a 30-day, “same as cash” period from the point of sale was 726. Further information is set forth in the following table:
 ﻿
 ﻿

﻿ | 
-----------+----------------------------------------------------------
﻿ | 
FICO Score | Percentage of originated and serviced VOI receivables (1)
<600 | 2.0% 
600 - 699 | 32.0% 
700+ | 65.0% 

  ﻿

(1) | Excludes loans for which the obligor did not have a FICO score. For 2018, approximately 1% of our VOI notes receivable related to financing provided to borrowers with no FICO score.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Collection Policies
 ﻿
 Financed VOI sales originated by us typically utilize a note and mortgage. Collection efforts related to these VOI loans are managed by us. Our collectors are incentivized through a performance-based compensation program.
 ﻿


 
17

We generally make collection efforts with respect to Vacation Club owners with outstanding loans secured by their VOI by mail, telephone and email (as early as 10 days past due). At 30 days past due, we mail a collection letter to the owner, if a U.S. resident, advising that if the loan is not brought current, the delinquency will be reported to a credit reporting agency. At 60 days past due, we mail a letter to the owner advising that he or she may be prohibited from making future reservations for lodging at a resort. At 90 days past due, we stop the accrual of, and reverse previously accrued but unpaid, interest on the note receivable and typically mail a notice informing the owner that unless the delinquency is cured within 30 days, we may terminate the underlying VOI ownership. If an owner fails to bring the account current within the given timeframe, the loan is typically defaulted and the owner’s VOI is terminated. In that case, we mail a final letter, typically at approximately 120 days past due, notifying the owner of the loan default and the termination of his or her beneficial interest in the VOI property. Thereafter, we may seek to resell the VOI to a new purchaser. In certain cases, at our discretion, we may not default the loan and terminate the underlying VOI, in which case the loan would remain delinquent.
 ﻿
 Allowance for Loan Losses
 ﻿
 Under vacation ownership accounting rules, we estimate uncollectible VOI notes receivable based on historical amounts for similar VOI notes receivable and do not consider the value of the underlying collateral. We hold large pools of homogeneous VOI notes receivable and assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables. In estimating future loan losses, management does not use a single primary indicator of credit quality, but instead evaluates our VOI notes receivable based upon a combination of factors including a static pool analysis that incorporates the aging of the respective receivables, default trends, and prepayment rates by origination year, as well as the FICO scores of borrowers.
 ﻿
 Substantially all defaulted VOI notes receivable result in the holder of such receivable acquiring the related VOI that secured such receivable, typically soon after default and at little or no cost. The reacquired VOI is then available for resale in the normal course of business.
 ﻿
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about the performance of our notes receivable portfolio.
 ﻿
 Sales/Financing of Receivables
 ﻿
 Our ability to sell or borrow against our VOI notes receivable has historically been an important factor in meeting our liquidity requirements. The vacation ownership business generally involves sales where a buyer is only required to pay 10% of the purchase price up front, while at the same time selling and marketing expenses related to such sales are primarily cash expenses that exceed the down payment amount. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately 49% of system-wide sales of VOIs. Accordingly, having facilities for the sale or hypothecation of VOI notes receivable, along with periodic term securitization transactions, has been a critical factor in meeting our short and long-term cash needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about our VOI notes receivable purchase facilities and term securitizations.
 ﻿
 Receivables Servicing
 ﻿
 Receivables servicing includes collecting payments from borrowers and remitting the funds to the owners, lenders or investors in such receivables, accounting for principal and interest on such receivables, making advances when required, contacting delinquent borrowers, terminating a Vacation Club ownership in the event that defaults are not timely remedied and performing other administrative duties.
 ﻿
 We receive fees for servicing our securitized notes receivable and these fees are included as a component of interest income. Additionally, we earn servicing fee income from third-party developers in connection with our servicing of their loan portfolios under certain fee-based services arrangements, which is netted against the cost of our mortgage servicing operations.

 Our Core Operating and Growth Strategies
 ﻿
 Grow VOI sales
 ﻿
 Our goal is to utilize our sales and marketing platform to achieve VOI sales growth through the expansion of existing alliances, continued development of new marketing programs and additional VOI sales to our existing Vacation Club owners. We believe there are a number of opportunities within our existing marketing alliances to drive future growth, including the potential expansion of our marketing efforts with Bass Pro to include programs focused on Bass Pro’s e-commerce platform. In addition, through our agreement with Choice Hotels, we plan to enhance our marketing program through further penetration of Choice Hotels’ digital and call-transfer programs. In addition to existing programs, we have plans to utilize our sales and marketing expertise to continue to identify unique marketing relationships with nationally-recognized brands that resonate with our core demographic. In addition, we will continue to actively seek to sell additional VOI points to our existing Vacation Club owners, which typically involve significantly lower marketing costs and have higher conversion rates compared to sales to new customers. Our goal is to expand and update our sales offices to more effectively convert tours generated by our marketing programs into sales. To this end, we are focused on identifying high traffic resorts where we believe increased investment in sales office infrastructure will yield strong sales results.
 ﻿
 Continue to enhance our Vacation Club experience
 ﻿
 We believe our Vacation Club offers owners exceptional value. Our Vacation Club offers owners access to our 45 Club Resorts and 24 Club Associate Resorts in premier vacation destinations, as well as access to over 11,000 other hotels and resorts and other vacation experiences, such as cruises, through partnerships and exchange networks. We continuously seek new ways to add value and flexibility to our Vacation Club membership and enhance the vacation experience of our Vacation Club owners, including the addition of new destinations, the expansion of our exchange programs and the addition of new partnerships to offer increased vacation options. We also continuously seek to improve our technology, including websites and applications, to enhance our Vacation Club owners’ experiences. We believe this focus, combined with our high-quality customer service, will continue to enhance the Vacation Club experience, driving sales to new owners and additional sales to existing Vacation Club owners.
 ﻿
 Grow our higher-margin, cash generating businesses
 ﻿
 We seek to continue to grow our ancillary businesses, including resort management, title services and loan servicing. We believe these businesses can grow with little additional investment in infrastructure and potentially produce higher-margin revenue.
 ﻿
 Increase sales and operating efficiencies across all customer touch-points
 ﻿
 We actively seek to improve our operational execution across all aspects of our business. In our sales and marketing platform, we utilize a variety of screening methods and data-driven analyses intended to identify and attract high-quality prospects to our sales offices in an effort to increase Volume Per Guest (“VPG”), an important measure of sales efficiency. We also continue to test new and innovative methods to generate sales prospects with a focus on increasing cost efficiency. In connection with our management services and consumer financing activities, we will continue to seek to leverage our size, infrastructure and expertise to increase operating efficiency and profitability. In addition, as we expand, we expect to gain further operational efficiencies by streamlining our support operations, such as call centers, customer service, administration and information technology.
 ﻿
 Maintain operational flexibility while growing our business
 ﻿
 We believe we have built a flexible business model that allows us to capitalize on opportunities and quickly adapt to changing market environments. We intend to continue to pursue growth through a balanced mix of capital-light sales vs. developed VOI sales, sales to new customers vs. sales to existing Vacation Club owners and cash sales vs. financed sales. While we may from time to time pursue opportunities that impact our short-term results, our long-term goal is to achieve sustained growth while maximizing earnings and cash flow.
 ﻿

 Pursue strategic transactions
 ﻿
 As part of our growth strategy, we may seek acquisitions of other VOI companies, resort assets, sales and marketing platforms, management companies and contracts, and other assets, properties and businesses, including where we believe significant synergies and cost savings may be available. We may choose to pursue these acquisitions directly or in partnership with third-party developers or others, including pursuant to arrangements where third-party developers purchase the resort assets and we sell the VOIs in the acquired resort on a commission basis. We have a history of successfully identifying, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses, and we believe our flexible sales and marketing platform enables us to complete these transactions in a variety of economic conditions.
 ﻿
 Industry Overview 
 ﻿
 The vacation ownership, or timeshare, industry is one of the fastest growing segments of the global travel and tourism sector. By purchasing a VOI, the purchaser typically acquires either (i) a fee simple interest in a property (or collection of properties) providing annual usage rights at the owner’s home resort (where the owner’s VOI is deeded), or (ii) an annual or biennial allotment of points that can be redeemed for stays at properties included in the vacation ownership company’s resort network or for other vacation options available through exchange programs. Compared to hotel rooms, vacation ownership units typically offer more spacious floor plans and residential features, such as living rooms, fully equipped kitchens and dining areas. Compared to owning a vacation home in its entirety, the key advantages of vacation ownership products typically include a lower up-front acquisition cost and annual expenses, resort-style features and services and, often, an established infrastructure to exchange usage rights for stays across multiple locations. 
 ﻿
 The vacation ownership industry was historically highly fragmented, with a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators having small resort portfolios of varying quality. We believe that growth in the vacation ownership industry has been driven by increased interest from resort developers and globally-recognized lodging and entertainment brands, increased interest from consumers seeking flexible vacation options, continued product evolution and geographic expansion. Approximately 9.6 million families (approximately 7.1% of U.S. households) own at least one VOI.    ﻿
 The average VOI owner is 40 years old, married, and 79% have either graduated from college or have attended some college.  VOI owners have an average household income of over $86,000 which is much higher than the average household income for the U.S.
 ﻿
 Regulation 
 ﻿
 The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulation. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, zoning, consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations, including those regarding the acquisition, marketing and sale of VOIs, as well as various aspects of our financing operations. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or unfair competition in interstate commerce. In addition, many states have what are known as “Little FTC Acts” that apply to intrastate activity. 
 ﻿
 In addition to the laws applicable to our customer financing and other operations discussed below, we are or may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal laws, rules and regulations. We are also subject to various foreign laws with respect to La Cabana Beach Resort and Casino in Oranjestad, Aruba and Blue Water Resort at Cable Beach in Nassau, Bahamas. The cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations may be significant and while we strive to be in compliance, we may not at all times be successful. Any failure to comply with current or future applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results and operations. 
 ﻿
 Our vacation ownership product is subject to various regulatory requirements, including state and local approvals. In most states we are required to file a detailed offering statement describing our business and all material aspects of the project and sale of VOIs with a designated state authority. In addition, when required by state law, we provide our VOI purchasers with a public offering disclosure statement that contains, among other items, detailed information about the VOI product and the purchaser’s rights and obligations as a VOI owner. Laws in each state where we sell VOIs generally grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified 

 
20

rescission period following the earlier of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us. Most states have other laws that regulate our activities, including real estate licensure requirements, sellers of travel licensure requirements, anti-fraud laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and labor laws. 
 ﻿
 Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the owner of real property is generally liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, the property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the property owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect a property owner’s ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. Other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing material when such material is in poor condition or in the event of construction, demolition, remodeling or renovation. Other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks. Noncompliance with any of these and other environmental, health or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations or development at a property. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to construction defects discovered on the property or repairs made by future owners of such property. Under these laws, we may be required to pay for repairs to the developed property. The development, management and operation of our resorts are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
 ﻿
 Our marketing, sales and customer financing activities are also subject to extensive regulation, which can include, but is not limited to: the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z; the Fair Housing Act; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Regulation AA; the Patriot Act; the Right to Financial Privacy Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; and anti-money laundering laws. The Dodd-Frank Act contains significant changes to the regulation of financial institutions and related entities, including the creation of new federal regulatory agencies, and the granting of additional authorities and responsibilities to existing regulatory agencies to identify and address emerging systemic risks posed by the activities of financial services firms. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) is one such regulatory agency created pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB’s mandate is to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws and to publish rules and forms that facilitate understanding of the financial implications of the transactions consumers enter into. Consistent with this mission, the CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish new disclosure requirements and forms pursuant to Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The practical impact upon us is the requirement to use a new Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Statement in lieu of the separate Good Faith Estimate and Closing Statement. In addition, our term securitization transactions must comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk retention rules. 
 ﻿
 Our management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including our purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with our secondary market arrangements, is subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making and the imposition of maintenance assessments. 
 ﻿
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 6% of our VOI sales were generated by marketing to prospective purchasers obtained through internal and third-party vendors’ outbound telemarketing efforts. We attempt to monitor the actions and legal and regulatory compliance of these third parties, but there are risks associated with our and such third parties’ telemarketing efforts. In recent years, state and federal regulators have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring the adherence to state “do not call” laws. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission have implemented national “do not call” legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe our exposure to adverse impacts from this heightened telemarketing legislation and enforcement may be partially mitigated by the use of “permission based marketing,” whereby we obtain the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future, thereby exempting such calls from the various “do not call” laws. We have also implemented policies and procedures that we believe will help reduce the possibility that individuals who have requested to be placed on a “do 

 
21

not call” list are not contacted, but such policies and procedures may not be effective in ensuring strict regulatory compliance. 
 ﻿
 To date, no material fines or penalties have been imposed on us as a result of our telemarketing operations. However, from time to time, we have been the subject of proceedings for violation of the telemarketing laws and other laws applicable to the marketing and sale of VOIs. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a description of  litigation that was brought against us in January 2019 relating to telemarketing sales activities.
 ﻿
 See “Risk Factors” for a description of additional risks with respect to regulatory compliance. 
 ﻿
 Competition 
 ﻿
 We compete with various high profile and well-established firms, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. Many of the world’s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort properties. Major companies that now operate vacation ownership resorts directly or through subsidiaries include Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, the Walt Disney Company, Hilton Grand Vacations, Wyndham Destinations, and Diamond Resorts International. We also compete with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our products and services from those offered by our competitors. In our fee-based services business, we typically compete with Hilton Grand Vacations and Wyndham Destinations. In addition to competing for sales leads, prospects and fee-based service clients, we compete with other VOI developers for marketing, sales and resort management personnel. 
 ﻿
 Seasonality 
 ﻿
 We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. This seasonality has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Although more potential customers typically visit our sales offices during the quarters ending in June and September, our ultimate recognition of the resulting sales during these periods may be later as a result of the impact of the amount of down payment provided by customers or due to the timing of development and required use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. 
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 5,816 employees, 529 of whom were located at our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, and 5,287 of whom were located in regional field offices throughout the United States and Aruba. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 28 of our employees were covered by two collective bargaining agreements, which address the terms and conditions of their employment, including pay rates, working hours, certain employee benefits and procedures for settlement of labor disputes. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
 ﻿
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 ﻿
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of golden parachute payments, and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 ﻿
 ​
 We have taken advantage of certain of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies and may continue to do so until December 31, 2022 (the end of the fifth fiscal year following the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock) or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, more than $700.0 million 

 
22

in market value of our stock is held by non-affiliates (so long as we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one Annual Report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.
 ﻿
 Subsequent Event
 ﻿
 On March 4, 2019, BBX Capital announced its intention to take Bluegreen private through a short-form merger under Florida law pursuant to which BBX Capital will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen’s common stock not currently owned by BBX Capital. If the proposed merger is completed, Bluegreen will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of BBX Capital and each share of Bluegreen’s common stock outstanding at the effective time of the merger, other than shares beneficially owned by BBX Capital and shareholders who duly exercise and perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Florida law, will be converted into the right to receive $16.00 per share in cash. 
     BBX Capital, indirectly through a wholly owned subsidiary, currently owns approximately 90% of Bluegreen’s outstanding common stock. Under Florida law, because BBX Capital owns more than 80% of the outstanding shares of Bluegreen’s common stock, the merger may be consummated without the approval of, or action by, Bluegreen’s Board of Directors or its other shareholders. Accordingly, Bluegreen’s Board of Directors did not approve or disapprove the merger, and Bluegreen’s shareholders will not be asked to approve or disapprove the merger but will have statutory appraisal rights if the merger is consummated.
     The merger is expected to be completed 30 days after the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC relating to the merger is first mailed to Bluegreen's shareholders, or as soon as practicable thereafter.  However, the merger may be terminated at any time before it becomes effective. There is no assurance that the merger will be consummated on the contemplated terms, or at all.
