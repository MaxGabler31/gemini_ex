Our operating subsidiaries pay service fees to these third-party healthcare service providers based on the number of health products, medical examinations and the services they provide for our customers.

The successful execution of our business plan is subject to risks and uncertainties related to our business and industry, including those relating to our ability to:




● | maintain and enhance the recognition and reputation of our Longduoduo brand;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compete effectively;
--+---------------------


● | manage our growth or execute our strategies effectively;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | provide superior customer experience and offer services at attractive prices to meet customer needs and preferences;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | manage and expand our relationships with suppliers and third-party service providers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | secure and retain the services of qualified personnel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------




We face significant competition from two main types of competitors: the medical examination departments of major public hospitals and private medical examination companies. Some of our current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these larger and better funded competitors.



Our performance will be largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition for such qualified employees is intense. If we do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or in retaining or motivating them, we may be unable to grow effectively.



We rely on our third-party healthcare service providers to provide services to our customers under cooperation arrangements with us. We require and expect these third-party healthcare service providers to possess the licenses and qualifications that are required for their operations and to adhere to certain performance standards both in terms of customer service and the quality of the medical care that they provide. We generally do not have control over the quality of service or medical care that these third-parties provide. They may not at all times possess the permits or qualifications required by laws and regulations or may fail to meet other regulatory requirements for their operations. In addition, they may engage in conduct which our customers find unacceptable, including providing poor service, mishandling sensitive personal healthcare information and committing medical malpractice.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



We face significant competition from two main types of competitors: the medical examination departments of major public hospitals and private medical examination companies. The private medical examination market is further segmented into (i) large national companies; (ii) regional providers; and (iii) numerous local independent medical examination centers located in nearly every city in China.



We believe our primary competitive advantages over our competitors include:




● | strong sales and marketing efforts; and
--+----------------------------------------


● | the innovation of the market business idea and flexible management mechanism.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that we are well-positioned to effectively compete on the basis of the factors listed above. However, some of our current or future competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, better supplier relationships, larger customer bases or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these larger and better funded competitors.
