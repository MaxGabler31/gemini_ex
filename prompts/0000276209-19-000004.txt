ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
The Registrant, Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (referred to as “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) was incorporated in 1974, with The Connecticut Water Company (“Connecticut Water”) as its largest subsidiary which was organized in 1956. Connecticut Water Service, Inc. is a non-operating holding company, whose income is derived from the earnings of its six wholly-owned subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2018.  In 2018, approximately 85% of the Company’s net income, which includes the impact of merger costs, was attributable to water operations carried out within its four regulated water companies, Connecticut Water, The Heritage Village Water Company (“HVWC”), The Avon Water Company (“Avon Water”) and The Maine Water Company (“Maine Water”), together the “Regulated Companies”.  As of December 31, 2018, the Regulated Companies supplied water to 139,574 customers, representing a population of approximately 450,000, in 80 municipalities throughout Connecticut and Maine and approximately 3,000 wastewater customers in Southbury, CT.  The Regulated Companies are subject to state regulation regarding financial issues, rates, and operating issues, and to various other state and federal regulatory agencies concerning water quality and environmental standards.
In addition to its Regulated Companies, the Company owns two active unregulated companies.  In 2018, these unregulated companies, together with real estate transactions and Maine Water’s unregulated operations, contributed the remaining 15% of the Company’s net income through real estate transactions as well as services and rentals.  The two active unregulated companies are Chester Realty, Inc., a real estate company in Connecticut; and New England Water Utility Services, Inc. (“NEWUS”), which provides contract water and sewer operations and other water related services.
Our mission centers on passionate employees delivering life sustaining, high quality water service to families and communities while providing a fair return to our shareholders.

Proposed Merger with SJW Group
On August 5, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Revised Merger Agreement”) with SJW Group, a Delaware corporation (“SJW”), and Hydro Sub, Inc., a Connecticut corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SJW (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW (the “Merger”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Revised Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain cancelled shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $70.00 per share, payable without interest. The Revised Merger Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “First Amended and Restated Merger Agreement”), dated as of May 30, 2018, by and among the Company, SJW and Merger Sub, which amended and restated in its entirety the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”), dated as of March 14, 2018, by and among the Company, SJW and Merger Sub. 
The Board of Directors approved, adopted and declared advisable the Revised Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommended that the Company’s shareholders approve the Revised Merger Agreement following a comprehensive review of the transaction. The Revised Merger Agreement was approved by the Company’s shareholders on November 16, 2018. 
The Merger is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including, among other things, approval of the Revised Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders (which was received on November 16, 2018) and regulatory approvals (including the approval of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (“PURA”) and the Maine Public Utilities Commission (“MPUC”)). The required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “HSR Act”), was terminated early on April 27, 2018. The early termination will expire and the Company and SJW will need to re-file the necessary notifications under the HSR Act if the Merger is not consummated by April 27, 2019. On October 15, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) consented to the joint application for transfer of control filed by the Company and SJW on October 4, 2018 and amended on October 12, 2018, and no further clearance from the FCC is required.
On May 4, 2018, Maine Water filed with MPUC an application for approval of the Merger. On May 7, 2018, the Company and SJW filed with PURA a joint application for approval of the Merger. Following the start on May 31, 2018 of a 45-day go-shop process permitted by the First Amended and Restated Merger Agreement, the Company and SJW withdrew their joint PURA application on June 19, 2018, and filed a new joint application on July 18, 2018 following the end of the go-shop process. On January 9, 2019, the Company and SJW withdrew their current application before PURA and announced that they were continuing to evaluate their regulatory approach, including the possibility of submitting a new application to PURA in connection with the Merger. On January 23, 2019, Maine Water voluntarily requested to withdraw its application before MPUC, aligning the Maine regulatory process with the regulatory process in Connecticut. After a thorough review conducted by the management and boards of the Company and SJW, and with the support of their respective Connecticut regulatory counsel, the Company disclosed on February 21, 2019 that the companies decided to file new applications with PURA and MPUC which are intended to address PURA’s concerns. The Company and SJW expect that the new applications will be filed during the second quarter of 2019. PURA must make a ruling on the merger within 120 days after the filing of an application, unless the Company and SJW agree to an extension of the 120-day timeframe. MPUC must make a ruling on the merger within 60 days after the filing of an application, unless it determines that the necessary investigation cannot be concluded within 60 days, in which event it can extend the review period for up to an additional 120 days.
On July 20, 2018, the California Public Utilities Commission (“CPUC”) formally issued an Order Instituting Investigation (the “Order”) providing that CPUC will investigate whether the Merger is subject to CPUC approval and the Merger’s anticipated impacts within California. CPUC held a public participation hearing on January 31, 2019 in connection with the Order.
Our Regulated Companies
Our Regulated Companies are subject to seasonal fluctuations and weather variations.  The demand for water is generally greater during the warmer months than the cooler months due to customers’ incremental water consumption related to cooling systems and various outdoor uses such as private and public swimming pools and lawn sprinklers.  Demand will vary with rainfall and temperature levels from year to year and season to season, particularly during the warmer months. The financial risk associated with changes in demand was mitigated in the State of Connecticut due to the adoption of the Water Revenue Adjustment (“WRA”) by Connecticut Water in 2013 and by HVWC in 2015. Currently, Avon Water does not utilize the WRA.
In general, the profitability of the water utility industry is largely dependent on the timeliness and adequacy of rates allowed by utility regulatory commissions. In addition, profitability is affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control, 
7

such as costs to comply with security, environmental, and water quality regulations. Inflation and other factors also impact costs for construction, materials and personnel related expenses.
The Company believes that we are presently in compliance with current environmental and water quality regulations, but the regulations are subject to change at any time.  The costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations, which could require us to modify existing filtration facilities and/or construct new ones, or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply, could be substantial.
Regulatory Matters
The rates we charge our water and wastewater customers in Connecticut and Maine are established under the jurisdiction of and are approved by PURA and MPUC, respectively.  It is our policy to seek rate relief as necessary to enable us to achieve an adequate rate of return.  The Regulated Companies’ allowed returns on equity and allowed returns on rate base are as follows:

As of December 31, 2018 | Allowed Return on Equity | | Allowed Return on Rate Base
Connecticut Water | 9.75 | % | | 7.32 | %
HVWC (blended water and wastewater rates) | 10.10 | % | | 7.19 | %
Avon Water | 10.00 | % | | 7.79 | %
Maine Water | 9.50 | % | | 7.96 | %

The PURA establishes rates in Connecticut on a company-wide basis while the MPUC approves Maine Water’s rates on a division-by-division basis. Each of Connecticut Water, HVWC, Avon Water and Maine Water are allowed to add surcharges to customers’ bills in order to recover certain costs associated with approved capital projects in between full rate cases, as well as approved surcharges for the WRA, in Connecticut, as discussed in more detail below. HVWC has not added surcharges to customers’ bills in order to recover certain approved capital projects as of December 31, 2018, however, HVWC, as authorized by PURA, began to utilize the WRA as of May 1, 2015.
On January 3, 2018, PURA reopened the most recent rate case decisions for the Company’s Connecticut Regulated Companies to determine what, if any, adjustments to rates are appropriate to account for revisions to tax laws, including corporate tax rates, contained in the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). On January 23, 2019, PURA issued a decision that determined the appropriate accounting and rate treatments for the reduction in the Federal Corporate Income Tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. The reduction in the Federal Corporate Income Tax impacts two specific areas of corporate income tax that the regulated water utilities must account for: a) the income tax expense included in rates charged to customers; and b), the Excess Accumulated Deferred Income Tax (“EADIT”) liability accrued on the regulated utilities books.
PURA has directed regulated water companies, including Avon and HVWC, to create a regulatory liability as of January 1, 2018 to account for the reduced Federal Corporate Income Tax expense and defer treatment until the companies file their next general rate cases, at which point the companies will propose a method to return the regulatory liability to customers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Avon and HVWC recorded regulatory liabilities in the amounts of $154,000 and $89,000, respectively, in anticipation of the final decision. Additionally, PURA directed Avon and HVWC, to establish a liability account for the EADIT from January 1, 2018, going forward, which will also be returned to customers commencing with the companies’ next rate cases. As discussed below, Connecticut Water has entered into a settlement agreement with the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (“OCC”), which was approved by PURA, which covers treatment of the Tax Act.
On January 11, 2018, the MPUC issued a notice of investigation to determine the impact of the Tax Act on Maine Water. The investigation will allow the MPUC to determine what, if any, adjustments to rates are appropriate to account for revisions to tax laws, including corporate tax rates contained in the Tax Act. In addition to determining the impact of the Tax Act, the MPUC will consider whether to issue an accounting order to establish a regulatory liability as of January 1, 2018 to account for the reduced Federal Corporate Income Tax expense and defer treatment until the divisions file their next general rate case, at which point each division will propose a method to return the regulatory liability to customers. Following discovery, technical conferences were held on April 19, 2018, July 17, 2018, and October 15, 2018. A settlement conference was held on December 6, 2018. The Company expects to reach a settlement with the MPUC in the first quarter of 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Maine Water recorded a regulatory liability in the amount of $167,000, in anticipation of a settlement.

The Heritage Village Water Company Acquisition
As previously reported, on May 10, 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire HVWC, pending a vote of HVWC shareholders, approval by PURA and MPUC and the satisfaction of other various closing conditions, pursuant to the terms of Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 10, 2016 between and among HVWC, the Company, and HAC, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary (the “Merger Agreement”). HVWC serves approximately 4,700 water customers in the Towns of Southbury, Middlebury, and Oxford, Connecticut and approximately 3,000 wastewater customers in the Town of Southbury, Connecticut.
The acquisition was executed through a stock-for-stock merger transaction valued at approximately $16.9 million. Holders of HVWC common stock received shares of the Company’s common stock in a tax-free exchange. In addition, the transaction reflected a total enterprise value of HVWC of approximately $21.5 million, with the $16.9 million paid to shareholders in a stock exchange and the assumption by the Company of approximately $4.6 million of debt held by HVWC at the time of the acquisition.
The Company received regulatory approval from MPUC on September 28, 2016 and from PURA on December 5, 2016, to proceed with the transaction. The shareholders of HVWC voted to approve the acquisition at a special meeting of HVWC’s shareholders held on February 27, 2017.
On February 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of HVWC by completing the merger of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary HAC, Inc. with and into HVWC, with HVWC as the surviving corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Connecticut corporate law. Upon the effective time of the Merger, the holders of HVWC’s 1,620 issued and outstanding shares of common stock became entitled to receive an aggregate of 300,445 shares of the Company’s common stock in a tax-free exchange, which exchange was commenced promptly by the issuance of a letter of transmittal and related materials by Connecticut Water’s exchange agent.
The Avon Water Company Acquisition
As previously reported, on October 12, 2016, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Avon Water, pending a vote of Avon Water shareholders, approval by PURA and the MPUC and the satisfaction of other various closing conditions, pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 11, 2016 as amended on March 29, 2017 between and among Avon Water, the Company, and WC-A I, Inc., the Company’s wholly-owned Connecticut subsidiary (the “Merger Agreement”). Avon Water serves approximately 4,800 customers in the Farmington Valley communities of Avon, Farmington, and Simsbury, Connecticut.
On February 10, 2017, Connecticut Water received regulatory approval from MPUC and on April 12, 2017, Connecticut Water received regulatory approval from PURA to proceed with the transaction. The shareholders of Avon Water voted to approve the acquisition at a special meeting of Avon Water’s shareholders held on June 16, 2017.
Effective July 1, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Avon Water by completing the merger of Connecticut Water’s wholly-owned subsidiary WC-A I, Inc. with and into Avon Water, with Avon Water as the surviving corporation, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and Connecticut corporate law. Upon the effective time of the Merger, the holders of Avon Water’s 122,289 issued and outstanding shares of common stock became entitled to receive the following merger consideration for each share of Avon Water common stock held: (i) a cash payment of $50.11; and (ii) a stock consideration component, consisting of 3.97 shares of the Company’s common stock.
The transaction was completed through a stock-for-stock exchange where Avon Water shareholders received the Company’s common stock valued at approximately $26.9 million, in a tax-free exchange, and a cash payment of $6.1 million for a total payment to shareholders of $33.0 million. The transaction reflects a total enterprise value of approximately $39.1 million, with the $33.0 million paid to shareholders and the assumption by the Company of approximately $6.1 million of debt held by Avon Water at the time of acquisition.
Connecticut Rates
Connecticut Water’s Water Infrastructure Conservation Adjustment (“WICA”) was 0.00%, 9.81% and 7.13% above base rates at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Avon Water’s WICA surcharge was 9.31% and 8.09%. As of December 31, 2018, HVWC has not filed for a WICA surcharge. On December 27, 2018, PURA issued a final decision authorizing Connecticut Water to implement a 2.15% WICA surcharge on customers’ bills effective January 1, 2019, representing approximately $19.5 million in WICA related projects.
On February 6, 2018, Connecticut Water filed a petition with PURA to reopen Connecticut Water’s 2010 rate case (previously reopened in 2013) proceeding for the limited purpose of approving a Settlement Agreement entered into by Connecticut Water 
9

and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (“OCC”) (the “Agreement”). The Agreement contemplates a change in Connecticut Water’s customer rates effective for bills rendered on and after April 1, 2018 made up of the following two components: (1) the revenue requirements associated with a $36.3 million addition to rate base to reflect necessary upgrades to Connecticut Water’s Rockville Water Treatment Plant; and (2) the folding in to base rates of the Company’s present WICA surcharges. In addition, the Agreement provides that:

1. | Upon implementation of new rates under the Agreement, until such time as new rates are adopted in a general rate case, through a temporary modification of the earnings sharing mechanism, Connecticut Water customers will receive one hundred percent of any earnings in excess of levels allowed by law rather than limiting such customer credits to 50% as contemplated by applicable law;


2. | Connecticut Water agrees it will not file for a general increase of Connecticut Water’s base rates unless those rates are to be effective on or after January 1, 2020;


3. | The pending proceeding initiated by PURA in Docket No. 09-12-11RE03, Application of The Connecticut Water Company for Amended Rates – Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act shall be closed; and


4. | Connecticut Water shall continue to make investments in infrastructure replacement consistent with its approved WICA plan. Connecticut Water shall be allowed to continue to pursue recovery of eligible projects through WICA. 

On August 15, 2018, PURA issued a final decision that accepted the conditions of a revised settlement agreement. The primary facets of the revised settlement agreement were the revenue requirements associated with the Rockville Water Treatment Plant, discussed above, and the folding of previously approved WICA surcharges into base rates, which reset Connecticut Water’s WICA to zero and resolution of the Company’s obligations related to the Tax Act. New rates were effective as of April 1, 2018.
Since 2013, Connecticut law has authorized a Water Revenue Adjustment (“WRA”) to reconcile actual water demands with the demands projected in the last general rate case and allows companies to adjust rates as necessary to recover the revenues approved by PURA in the last general rate case. The WRA removes the financial disincentive for water utilities to develop and implement effective water conservation programs. The WRA allows water companies to defer on the balance sheet, as a regulatory asset or liability, for later collection from or crediting to customers the amount by which actual revenues deviate from the revenues allowed in the most recent general rate proceedings. A similar WICA reconciliation adjustment mechanism allows the Connecticut water utilities that have WICA to be made whole, and not more than whole for their allowed WICA revenues during a calendar year. Additionally, projects eligible for WICA surcharges were expanded to include energy conservation projects, improvements required to comply with streamflow regulations, and improvements to acquired systems.
Connecticut Water and HVWC’s allowed revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, as approved by PURA during each company’s last general rate case and including subsequently approved WICA surcharges, were approximately $88.9 million. Through normal billing for the year ended December 31, 2018 operating revenue for Connecticut Water and HVWC would have been approximately $80.7 million had the WRA not been implemented. As a result of the implementation of the WRA, Connecticut Water and HVWC recorded $8.2 million in additional revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, which reflects increased allowed revenues, effective April 1, 2018, resulting from the application of the rate settlement approved by PURA during 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Connecticut Water recorded $4.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in additional revenue related to the WRA. Avon Water does not currently use the WRA mechanism.
Maine Rates
In Maine, the overall, approved cumulative Water Infrastructure Charge (“WISC”) for all of Maine Water’s divisions was 6.8%, 5.6% and 4.7% above base rates as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The WISC rates for the Biddeford and Saco division were reset to zero with the approval of the general rate increase discussed below. In January 2019, Maine Water filed six additional WISC applications which have been approved by the MPUC. These six new filings will add approximately $369,000 in annualized revenues.
On June 29, 2017, Maine Water filed for a rate increase in its Biddeford and Saco division. The rate request was for an approximate $1.6 million, or 25.1%, increase in revenues. The rate request was designed to recover higher operating expenses, depreciation and property taxes since Biddeford and Saco’s last rate increase in 2015. Maine Water and the Maine Office of the Public Advocate reached an agreement that increases annual revenue by $1.56 million. The agreement was approved by the MPUC on December 5, 2017, with new rates effective December 1, 2017.
A water revenue adjustment mechanism law in Maine became available to regulated water utilities in Maine on October 15, 2015.  Maine Water is currently precluded from seeking new rates in the Biddeford and Saco division due to provisions in the settlement agreement with the MPUC.  Maine’s rate-adjustment mechanism could provide revenue stabilization in divisions with declining water consumption and Maine Water expects to request usage of this mechanism in future rate filings when consumption trends support its use.

Maine Water Land Sale
On March 11, 2016, Maine Water entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the Coastal Mountains Land Trust, a Maine nonprofit corporation (the “Land Trust”) pursuant to which Maine Water agreed to sell two conservation easements to the Land Trust on approximately 1,400 acres of land located in the towns of Rockport, Camden and Hope, in Knox County, Maine valued in the aggregate at $3.1 million. The land had a book value of approximately $600,000 at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and is included in “Other Property and Investments” and “Utility Plant”, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The easements and purchase prices are as follows:
1. Ragged Mountain Mirror Lake Conservation Easement: $1,875,000; and
2. Grassy Pond Conservation Easement: $600,000.
The first transaction regarding Mirror Lake was completed on September 27, 2018. As a result of the transaction, Maine Water has recognized $435,000 in net income in the period and has recorded a regulatory liability of $435,000 that will be refunded to customers over a one-year period, beginning January, 2019. In addition to the net income recorded as a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a $100,000 deferred income tax benefit due to the timing difference related to the cash refund to customers. The total net income benefit recorded by the Company for this transaction was $535,000 presented as $625,000 in gain on real estate transactions offset by $90,000 of donation deduction in the Other line item. Maine Water also made a $250,000 contribution to the Land Trust at the closing.
The second transaction regarding Grassy pond is scheduled to close on or before December 31, 2019. The second transaction is structured such that Maine Water will sell a conservation easement valued at $1,200,000 for $600,000. Accordingly, Maine Water expects to claim a $600,000 charitable deduction on the bargain sale. Similarly to the first transaction, net proceeds from the second transaction will be shared equally between the customers of the Camden Rockland division and Maine Water.
Our Water Systems
As of December 31, 2018, our water infrastructure consisted of 77 noncontiguous water systems in the States of Connecticut and Maine.  Our system, in total, consists of approximately 2,300 miles of water main and reservoir storage capacity of 9.4 billion gallons.  The safe, dependable yield from our 249 active wells and 25 surface water supplies is approximately 185 million gallons per day.  Water sources vary among the individual systems, but overall approximately 80% of the total dependable yield comes from surface water supplies and 20% from wells.
For the year-ended December 31, 2018, our Regulated Companies’ 139,574 customers consumed approximately 10.1 billion gallons of water, generating $116,665,000 in operating revenues.  We supply water, and in most cases, fire protection to all or portions of 80 towns throughout Connecticut and Maine.

The Regulated Companies own various small, discrete parcels of land that are no longer required for water supply purposes.  At December 31, 2018, this land totaled over 600 acres.  Over the past several years, we have been disposing of these land parcels through sales and/or donations, primarily to towns and municipalities. For more information, please refer to Segments of Our Business below.
Additional information on land dispositions can be found in Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Commitments and Contingencies”.
Competition
Our Regulated Companies face competition from a few small privately-owned water systems operating within, or adjacent to, our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 297 people.  Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Segments of Our Business
For management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments: Water Operations (our Regulated Companies), Real Estate Transactions (through either our regulated or unregulated companies), and Services and Rentals (our unregulated companies and certain unregulated transactions within Maine Water).
Water Operations – The Water Operations segment is comprised of our core regulated water operations to supply public drinking water and provide wastewater services to our customers.  This segment encompasses all transactions of our Regulated Companies with the exception of certain real estate transactions, including costs associated with acquisitions of Regulated Companies. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 15, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Real Estate Transactions – Our Real Estate Transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings.  These transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies.  Through land donations and sales in previous years, the Company earned tax credits to use in future years.  The Company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold a small parcel of land and adjusted previously adjusted tax reserves related to previously completed land sales/donations resulting in a loss of $54,000. During 2017, the Company sold small parcels of land in Connecticut and Maine. These transactions generated $33,000 in net income in the Real Estate segment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the first phase of the previously discussed sale of conservation easement in Maine. Net income from the Real Estate Transactions segment is shown net in the “Other Income (Deductions), Net of Taxes” portion of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 15, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.

A breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows:

 | Income (Loss) from Real Estate Transactions
 | Regulated | | Unregulated | Total
2018 | $ | 629,000 | | $ | — | $ | 629,000 | 
2017 | $ | 33,000 | | $ | — | $ | 33,000 | 
2016 | $ | (54,000 | ) | $ | — | $ | (54,000 | )

Services and Rentals – Our Services and Rentals segment provides contracted services to water utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies in the State of Connecticut and through Maine Water in the State of Maine.  The types of services provided include contract operations of water facilities and Linebacker®, our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers.  Our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property. Net income from the Services and Rentals segment is shown net in the “Other Income (Deductions), Net of Taxes” portion of the Company’s “Consolidated Statements of Income”. More detailed information, including revenues, costs and income taxes associated with the segment can be found in Note 15, “Segment Reporting” in the Company’s “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”.
Linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the Company to eligible residential customers through NEWUS in Connecticut and Maine Water in Maine covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide drinking water to a customer’s home. For customers who enroll in this program, the Company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line, curb box, curb box cover, meter pit, meter pit cover, meter pit valve plus in-home water main shut off valve before the meter. This was the sixth year that NEWUS has successfully offered expanded coverage to Connecticut Water customers for failure of in-home plumbing, sewer and septic drainage lines and implemented modified terms and conditions with limitations on certain coverages. As of December 31, 2018, NEWUS had approximately 20,000 customers enrolled in its Linebacker protection program and over 35% were enrolled in one of our expanded coverage plans. Depending on the coverage selected, Linebacker prices range between $88 to $190, effective March 1, 2018. Maine Water offers basic service line protection under Linebacker to its customers at a rate of $85. As of December 31, 2018, Maine Water had approximately 2,500 customers enrolled in Linebacker.
Some of the services listed above have limited competition. However, the Company has seen competitors in the service line protection business begin to market to Connecticut Water and Maine Water customers. Additionally, there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water facilities and systems. The Company sought to develop a niche market by attaching our name to service line protection plans and by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition.  The Services and Rentals segment has provided between 5-11% of our overall net income in 2018, 2017, and 2016.  Net income generated by this segment of our business was $1,807,000, $1,167,000 and $1,219,000 for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
