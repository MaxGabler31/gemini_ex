Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.

The words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, will, should and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guaranties of future performance. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions. 
We are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions include those discussed under Risk Factors, Managements Discussion and Analysis and Business. Although we have sought to identify the most significant risks to our business, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, any of such risks may be realized, nor can there be any assurance that we have identified all possible issues which we might face. For all of these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law. We urge readers to review carefully the risk factors described in this Annual Report and in the other documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can read these documents at www.sec.gov.
 Where we say we, us, our, Company or CoConnect, we mean CoConnect, Inc.

Corporate History
 The Company was originally incorporated in Alabama in December 1997. Our original business plan was to take over the assets of businesses involved in reorganizations through bankruptcies.
 In 1997, we acquired Mobile Limited Liability Company as part of the confirmation of our Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. On August 6, 2000, we acquired all of the assets of Digital Wireless Systems, Inc. as part of the consummation of our confirmed Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Lack of funding forced us to abandon plans to revive the operations of both of these companies.
 In 2000, we acquired three operating subsidiaries: Daybreak Auto Recovery, Inc., Rap Group and Voltage Vehicles. In 2002, we rescinded these acquisitions, and in October 2004, we cancelled the common shares that were to be issued for the acquisitions, which shares had been held in escrow. During 2002 and 2003, we had no operations other than to continue our efforts to liquidate certain telecommunications licenses, our only assets, in order to pay creditors who had judgments arising out of the aforementioned bankruptcies.
 In August 2004, we reincorporated from Alabama to Nevada and changed our name to Advanced Wireless Communications, Inc.
 On October 5, 2004, we signed a definitive agreement with Heritage Communications, Inc. (Heritage) and acquired an exclusive license for the marketing and distribution of products over Heritages proprietary high-speed wireless network.
 On January 28, 2005, we executed a share exchange agreement with Heritage and its stockholders. The share exchange agreement closed on February 23, 2005 and superseded the exclusive license with Heritage by making Heritage our wholly owned subsidiary.
 In February 2005, we changed our name to CoConnect, Inc.
 On July 14, 2005, we rescinded the share exchange agreement with Heritage due to material omissions and misrepresentations that had been made by Heritage. As a result of the rescission, we cancelled the 30,000,000 shares of common stock previously issued to the stockholders of Heritage.
 On December 21, 2005, through our newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Phoenix Asset Acquisition Corporation, we purchased selected assets of Phoenix Systems Corp. (Phoenix). The terms of the purchase included the issuance of 8,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 2,000,000 shares were being held in escrow until certain performance measures were achieved, a $50,000 cash payment, and the assumption of approximately $374,000 of Phoenix liabilities and approximately $49,000 in obligations related to real property leases. Effective December 31, 2005, the Phoenix transaction was rescinded by mutual agreement.

On December 12, 2008, a majority of the holders of our common shares voted to authorize a 1-for-12,000 reverse split of our common stock, which became effective on January 12, 2009. As a result of the reverse split, our trading symbol was changed to CCON effective March 10, 2009.
 Change-in-Control Transaction
 On May 1, 2014, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the SPA), PacificWave Partners Limited, a Gibraltar company (PacificWave), acquired 2,307,767 shares of our outstanding common stock from our stockholders of record for $210,000 (approximately $0.09 per share), plus legal fees of $20,000. The 2,307,767 shares represented approximately 83.9% of our then outstanding shares of common stock. At closing, PacificWave also transferred a number of the purchased shares to certain persons and entities providing services in connection with the change-in-control transaction. At the conclusion of this transaction, PacificWave and Mr. Henrik Rouf, its Managing Director and sole owner, became the owners of an aggregate of 120,000 shares of our common stock, which constituted 4.4% of the outstanding shares of common stock at that time. We were not a party to these transactions.
 Additional terms of the SPA provided for the surrender and cancellation of all of the outstanding shares of our Series B preferred stock, totaling 100,000 shares in the aggregate. The SPA also stipulated that each of the selling stockholders waive any outstanding liabilities, claims, damages or obligations, contingent or otherwise, owed by us to the selling stockholders. Accordingly, amounts owed by us to such stockholders totaling approximately $24,000 were recorded as a contribution to additional paid-in capital on May 1, 2014.
 Effective May 1, 2014, our sole officer and director at that time, Mr. York Chandler (who had been previously appointed on December 31, 2013), resigned, and Mr. Bennett J. Yankowitz was appointed as our sole director, President, Secretary and Treasurer.
 In connection with the aforementioned transaction with PacificWave, Mr. Yankowitz purchased 461,000 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $42,000 (approximately $0.09 per share) from PacificWave on May 1, 2014, reflecting approximately 16.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at that time. The purchase price was evidenced by a promissory note due May 1, 2019 with interest at 3% per annum and secured by the purchased shares. We were not a party to this transaction. PacificWave and Mr. Yankowitz did not have any relationship with us prior to the aforementioned change-in-control transaction.
 Mr. Rouf also serves as our Assistant Secretary. On July 15, 2015, we entered into an agreement with PacificWave to provide consulting and investment banking services to us, in particular with respect to raising capital for us and in identifying and evaluating potential acquisition candidates.

Current Business Operations
 We currently have no operations, and have been engaged in efforts to identify an operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction. As our planned principal operations have not yet commenced, our activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need to obtain additional financing, as described below.
 Management is seeking to identify an operating company and engage in a merger or business combination of some kind, or acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in a business that generates sustained revenues. We are considering several potential acquisitions and are investigating various candidates to determine whether they would have the potential to add value for the benefit of our stockholders.
 We do not intend to restrict our consideration to any particular business or industry segment, and we may consider, among other businesses, finance, brokerage, insurance, transportation, communications, services, natural resources, manufacturing, media or technology. Because we have limited resources, the scope and number of suitable candidates to merge with is relatively limited. Because we may participate in a business opportunity with a newly formed firm, a firm that is in the development stage, or a firm that is entering a new phase of growth, we may incur further risk due to the inability of the targets management to have proven its abilities or effectiveness, or the lack of an established market for the targets products or services, or the inability to reach profitability in the next few years.
 Any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to our present stockholders. As it is expected that the closing of such a transaction will result in a change in control of the Company, such transaction is expected to be accounted for as a reverse merger, with the operating company being considered the legal acquiree and accounting acquirer, and the Company being considered the legal acquirer and the accounting acquiree. As a result, at and subsequent to closing of any such transaction, the financial statements of the operating company would become our financial statements for all periods presented.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had no employees. Mr. Yankowitz has served as our sole officer and director since May 1, 2014, and devotes approximately 10% of his time on an annual basis to managing our matters.
