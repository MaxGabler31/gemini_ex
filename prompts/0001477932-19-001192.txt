ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Organizational History
 
Amerinac Holding Corp. (“Amerinac” or the “Company”) was previously known as Precision Aerospace Components Inc. (“Precision”) and Jordan 1 Holdings Company (“Jordan 1”) and was incorporated in Delaware on December 28, 2005. Jordan 1 is the successor to Gasel Transportation Lines, Inc. (“Gasel”), a corporation that was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio on January 27, 1988.
 
Gasel was a trucking company that filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division, in May 2003. On December 12, 2005, a final plan of reorganization was approved by the court and the bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.
 
Subsequent to December 30, 2005, Jordan 1 did not engage in any business activity until July 20, 2006 when it entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the equity of Delaware Fastener Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“DFAC”), pursuant to an exchange agreement with the stockholders of DFAC. Contemporaneously, DFAC acquired the assets, subject to certain liabilities, of Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich Supply”) pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) dated May 24, 2006 among DFAC, Freundlich Supply, and Michael Freundlich. The purchase of the assets was financed by the proceeds from the sale by the Company of its securities pursuant to a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”). As a result of the Exchange Agreement, DFAC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon completion of the foregoing transactions, the Company changed its name to Precision Aerospace Components, Inc. and DFAC changed its name to Freundlich Supply Company, Inc. (“Freundlich”). On March 13, 2009, Precision formed Tiger-Tight Corp., a Delaware corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary to serve as the exclusive North American master distributor of the Tiger-Tight locking washer.
 
On March 25, 2012, Precision formed two-wholly owned subsidiaries, Apace Acquisition I, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Apace Acquisition II, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On May 25, 2012, the Company acquired the assets and certain of the liabilities of Fastener Distribution and Marketing Company, Inc., which was comprised of two fastener distribution companies, Aero-Missile Components, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation and Creative Assembly Systems, Inc., an Ohio corporation. Apace Acquisition I, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Aero-Missile Components, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Aero-Missile Components, Inc. Apace Acquisition II, Inc. acquired all of the assets of Creative Assembly Systems, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to Creative Assembly Systems, Inc.

On January 16, 2015, Precision Group Holding, LLC (“PGH” or “Holdings”) and Capital Partners III L.P (“C3”) refinanced the outstanding debt of the Company and purchased approximately 31,116 newly issued shares of restricted Common Stock of the Company and C3 was granted 3,200 shares of restricted common stock of the Company, collectively representing approximately 86.22% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. On June 6, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved a resolution to increase authorized shares of Common Stock from 100,000,000 shares to 800,000,000 so as to be able to issue the additional shares of Common Stock to PGH and C3. Also on June 6, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved a resolution to deauthorize its Preferred A, B, and C stock. Effective June 30, 2016, the Company issued 174,028 and 85,096 shares of restricted common stock to PGH and C3, respectively, resulting in the collective ownership of 98.1%. On October 18, 2016, the Company completed a 1-for-2500 reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued. Shareholders received $0.02 in consideration for each “pre-split” share of a fractional share. On November 22, 2016, the shareholders of the Company approved a resolution to decrease the number of authorized shares of common stock from 800,000,000, par value $0.001 per share to 1,500,000, par value $0.001 per share.
 
In the first quarter of 2016, Precision’s wholly owned subsidiary, Freundlich, was merged into Aero-Missile Components, Inc. (“Aero-Missile”) and Precision’s wholly owned subsidiary, Tiger-Tight Corp. (“Tiger-Tight”) was merged into Creative Assembly Systems, Inc. (“Creative Assembly” or “CAS”). 
 
On April 28, 2017, the Company and Aero-Missile entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Aero-Missile Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Apollo Aerospace LLC (“Apollo”) pursuant to which Aero-Missile sold substantially all of its assets to Apollo and Apollo assumed certain liabilities of Aero-Missile (the “Asset Sale”) for an aggregate purchase price of $10.5 million paid by Apollo to Aero-Missile. The purchase price was subject to a working capital adjustment and $1.0 million being held in escrow (of which $500,000 was received in April 2018 and $500,000 was received in November 2018) to secure the indemnification obligations of the Company and Aero-Missile. During the third quarter of 2017, it was determined that $22,500 was owed by the Company to Apollo, under the terms of the working capital adjustment. Pursuant to the Aero-Missile Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company and Aero-Missile were required to change their corporate names. On May 1, Aero-Missile changed its name to “PolyAero Inc.” and on June 28, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Amerinac Holding Corp.” 
 
Simultaneous with the sale of Asset Sale, the Company repaid all amounts owing to C3. The total amount repaid was $4 million plus accrued interest of $42,389. In addition, the Company purchased the 96,697 shares of common stock of the Company owned by C3 for an aggregate purchase price of $900,000 that was mutually agreed to by the Company and C3.

On April 28, 2017, the balance of the proceeds of the Asset Sale, totaling $4,557,611, were used to partially pay down the principal balance of the WBCC Revolving Loan. Although the WBCC Revolving Loan was senior to the amounts owed to C3, WBCC consented to the early repayment of these loans in full. 
 
All financial results of Aero-Missile are classified as discontinued operations for the purposes of this annual report.
 
On July 12, 2017, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Prime Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Prime Metals & Alloys, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (“Prime Metals”) pursuant to which Prime Metals Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company subsidiary of Amerinac (“PMAL”) would purchase all of the assets of Prime Metals for an aggregate purchase price of $9.6 million pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to an order of the Bankruptcy Court, the Company paid a deposit of $0.5 million to be held in escrow. The deposit was credited to the purchase price at Closing. On March 2, 2017, Prime Metals filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of title of the United States Code (as amended, the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (the “Bankruptcy Court”) at case no. 17-70164-JAD.
 
On August 17, 2017, PMAL purchased substantially all of the assets of Prime Metals for $9.6 million in cash pursuant to the Prime Asset Purchase Agreement. To finance the purchase of the assets, on August 17, 2017, PMAL entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with SummitBridge National Investments V LLC (“Summit”) pursuant to which Summit made Loans to PMAL: (1) a Term Loan in the amount of $4,500,000 (“Summit Term Loan A”) and (2) a Term Loan in the amount of $3,500,000 (“Summit Term Loan B”) (collectively, the “Summit Loans”). In addition, in consideration for Summit making the Summit Loans, PMAL issued to SBN V PMA LLC, an affiliate of Summit (“SBN”), membership interests in PMAL equal to 25% of the equity ownership of PMAL (the “SBN Membership Interests”).
 
The Company guaranteed payment of the Summit Loans pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement made by the Company as of the Effective Date.
 
The Credit Agreement also contained customary covenants, representations and warranties of the parties, including, among others (1) the grant by PMAL to Summit of a security interest on all of the assets of PMAL, (2) a pledge with respect to the equity interests in PMAL owned by the Company, and (3) an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty by the Company of the performance by PMAL of the obligations under the Credit Agreement. In addition, until all amounts under the Summit Loans were paid in full, PMAL agreed to comply with certain financial covenants that require PMAL to meet pre-established financial ratios.
 
On July 17, 2017, the Company completed the closing of a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with approximately 17 accredited investors (the “Investors”), pursuant to which the Company sold to the Investors a total of 75,500 shares of restricted common stock (the “Shares”) of the Company at a purchase price of $40.00 per share, and total consideration of $3.02 million.

On September 28, 2017, the Company sold an additional 15,750 Shares at a purchase price of $40.00 per share, and total consideration of $630,000 to 5 Investors.
 
Effective May 8, 2018, PGH made a pro-rata, in-kind distribution of 196,743 Shares of common stock of the Company to its members for no consideration and ceased to be a shareholder of the Company.
 
On August 31, 2018 (the “Refinancing Date”), PMAL entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with Berkshire Bank (“Berkshire Bank”) establishing: 1) a new revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $6.0 million (the “Berkshire Revolving Loan”), 2) a term loan in the amount of $3.5 million (“Berkshire Term Loan A”) and 3) a term loan in the amount of $1.5 million (“Berkshire Term Loan B”). Borrowings under the Berkshire Revolving Loan may be used to finance working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Berkshire Revolving Loan had a borrowing base of approximately $2.3 million on December 31, 2018 of which the Company had drawn $1,092,058.
 
On August 31, 2018, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, PMAL used an amount of $7,678,814 under the Loan and Security Agreement to fully repay the Summit Loans. Pursuant to the terms of the Summit Loans and because PMAL repaid the Summit Loans within thirty-six (36) months of the origination of the Summit Loans, the SBN Membership Interests were reduced from 25% to 20% of PMAL as of September 1, 2018.

Industry Overview and Competition
 
The fastener distribution industry is highly fragmented. No one company holds a dominant position. This is primarily caused by the varied uses of fasteners and the size of the industry. Amerinac competes with the numerous fastener distributors which serve as authorized stocking distributors for one or more of the manufacturers in the Company’s supplier base. Amerinac believes that the depth of its inventory represents a competitive advantage. As a stocking distributor, the Company has employed a business model of maintaining levels of inventory on hand or on order with its suppliers that can satisfy its customers’ projected needs. The demanding quality, inspection, tracking and re-inspection requirements, part certifications and customer qualifications imposed on distributors of industrial fasteners by major consumers create a barrier to entry.
 
In addition to competing against other distributors, the company believes it faces competition from end users creating their own supply chain management.
 
The company believes its competitive attributes are as follows:
 

· | The Company’s quality system is certified to Rev. C, AS9120:2009 and ISO 9001:2008 quality measures. Since quality is an important measure of industrial suppliers, the Company strives to maintain its quality system to the highest standards in the industry. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | As an authorized stocking distributor for the premier domestic manufacturers, the Company is able to maintain relationships with customers not generally available to the industry. Many manufacturers in the past several years have consolidated their network of authorized distributors.

 
The steel foundry industry is a diverse industry. This is primarily caused by the varied sizes and shapes of metal produced, as well as, the numerous grades and quality of steel required for the end use applications. PMAL competes with the numerous mills in the United States and internationally. PMAL’s customers sell products into automotive, aerospace, medical device, as well as other industries. PMAL believes that its nimble and flexible production capabilities, and consistent high level of quality, provide competitive advantages. PMAL believes that the fixed costs needed for new entrants to the steel foundry market create very significant barriers to entry. 
 
Suppliers
 
No supplier represented more than 10% of product distributed for the year ending December 31, 2018. AVK represented approximately 14.3% of product distributed for the year ending December 31, 2017. Amounts owing to AVK outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 represented 11.8% and 17% of accounts payable, respectively. For nearly all suppliers, the Company looks to have secondary supply outlets. However, manufacturing issues with any supplier could cause temporary disruptions to the Company.
