Item 1. Business.
General Description of Business. Arcosa, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Arcosa,” “Company,” “we,” or “our”) headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading brands serving construction, engineered structures, and transportation markets in North America. Our individual businesses have built reputations for quality, service, and operational excellence over decades. Arcosa serves a broad spectrum of infrastructure-related markets and is strategically focused on driving organic and disciplined acquisition growth to capitalize on the fragmented nature of many of the industries in which we operate. With Arcosa’s current platform of businesses and additional growth opportunities, we are well-aligned with key market trends, such as the replacement and growth of aging transportation infrastructure, the continued shift to renewable power generation, and the expansion of new transmission, distribution, and telecommunications infrastructure. Our businesses support critical infrastructure sectors, pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency standards. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, our plants have continued to operate throughout the crisis, and we have seen better than anticipated demand in some sectors.
Arcosa is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated in 2018 in connection with the separation (the “Separation”) of Arcosa from Trinity Industries, Inc. (“Trinity” or “Former Parent”) on November 1, 2018 as an independent, publicly-traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 500 N. Akard Street, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75201. Our telephone number is 972-942-6500, and our Internet website address is www.arcosa.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments thereto, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Information on our Investor Relations page and on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other securities filings unless specifically incorporated herein by reference. 
Long-Term Vision. We are united in our shared purpose to fulfill the four pillars of our long-term vision.
Overview. Arcosa's three segments are made up of leading businesses that serve critical infrastructure markets:
Our Segments. The Company reports operating results in three principal business segments. For additional information regarding revenues, operating profit, and identifiable assets by segment, please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Construction Products.
Products
Through wholly owned subsidiaries, our Construction Products segment produces and sells natural and recycled aggregates, specialty materials, and construction site support equipment, including trench shields and shoring products. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to aggregates and specialty materials.
•Natural Aggregates: We are an established producer and distributor of natural aggregates serving both public infrastructure and private construction markets and operate in Texas, our largest geographic exposure, and 8 other states. We manage the business from the four regions of Texas (including Arkansas and Oklahoma), the Ohio River Valley, the Gulf Coast, and the West. We operate primarily from open pit quarries and have one underground mine. Our natural aggregates products include sand, gravel, limestone, stabilized material, and various other products used in the production of ready mixed concrete, cement, and other precast concrete products, roads, municipal and private water, sewer, and drainage projects, oil and gas well pads, wind farms, as well as various other building products. 
During 2021, we expanded our natural aggregates platform through two large acquisitions. In April 2021, we completed the acquisition of StonePoint Ultimate Holding, LLC and affiliated entities (collectively “StonePoint”), a top 25 U.S. construction aggregates company, which expanded our footprint in Texas and the Gulf Coast and provided entry into new geographic markets in Tennessee and the Ohio River Valley. In August 2021, we completed the acquisition of Southwest Rock Products, LLC and affiliated entities (collectively “Southwest Rock”), a leading Arizona pure-play aggregates producer, which provided scaled entry into the Phoenix metropolitan area.
•Recycled Aggregates: Recycled aggregates are a complement to our natural aggregates platform and are produced by crushing concrete reclaimed from demolished highways, buildings, and other structures. The raw product material is processed to remove steel, rebar, shingles, and other debris, and screened to appropriate sizes for use as a road base, erosion control for building foundations, and as a backfill for utility trenches. Recycled aggregates currently supply a small percentage of total aggregates supplied nationwide. We believe the supply of recycled aggregates will continue to grow in use due to resource scarcity and associated environment, social, and governance (“ESG”) benefits, reduced disposal and acceptance of concrete in landfills, and energy savings from less processing and transportation costs. Recycled aggregates are a substitute to natural aggregates, primarily for hard rock uses.
We added recycled aggregates to our portfolio in January 2020 with the acquisition of Cherry Industries, Inc. and affiliated entities (collectively "Cherry"), a leading producer of natural and recycled aggregates with multiple stationary crushing locations and portable on-site crushing capabilities across the Houston, Texas market. In October 2020, we further expanded our recycled aggregates footprint with the acquisition of Strata Materials, LLC (“Strata”), a leading provider of natural and recycled aggregates in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas market. In April 2021, we completed a small bolt-on acquisition which further expanded our recycled aggregates business in Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.
•Specialty Materials: Our specialty materials, including lightweight aggregates, select natural aggregates, and milled or processed specialty building products and agricultural products, are produced and distributed nationwide. We currently operate in ten states and British Columbia, with several of our production facilities operating at the quarries that produce the raw material inputs, which include shale, clay, limestone, and gypsum. Lightweight aggregates are select shales or clays that are expanded and hardened by high temperatures in a rotary kiln and possess a bulk density that can be less than half that of natural aggregates. Product applications include structural lightweight concrete, lightweight masonry block, and road surface treatments. Our specialty building products and agricultural products are processed at several production facilities across the U.S., mostly using our natural aggregates as a component of raw material supply. Product applications include plasters, prills, agricultural supplements and fertilizers, paints, flooring, glass, ingredients for food and feed, cement, energy infrastructure, and other products.
•Construction Site Support: We hold a strong market position in the manufacture of trench shields and shoring products for the U.S. construction industry. Trench shields and shoring products are used for water and sewer construction, utility installations, manhole work, oil and gas pipeline construction, and other underground applications. Additionally, we participate in certain regional rental markets for trench shoring equipment.
Markets
Over a multi-year horizon, we believe that approximately half of our current portfolio of construction materials are used in infrastructure projects. The other half of our construction materials demand is split across residential, non-residential, and specialty/other end markets.
•Infrastructure Construction: Infrastructure construction includes construction spending by federal, state, and local governments for roads, highways, bridges, airports, and other public infrastructure, as well as private spending on road and utility construction. Public infrastructure spending is typically supported by federal and state legislation and programs. On December 4, 2015, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act ("FAST Act") was signed into law. The FAST Act authorized $305 billion of public infrastructure funding from 2016 to 2020. It was subsequently extended to provide an additional $13.6 billion in 2021. On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act ("IIJA") was signed into law, which provides approximately $350 billion for federal highway programs from 2022 through 2026 by extending many of the programs in the FAST Act at higher funding levels, as well as supplemental funding for roads, bridges, and other major projects. Most of this funding is apportioned to states, based on formulas specified in the IIJA and provides funding through a wide range of competitive grant programs. On December 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration announced it would provide funding of $52.5 billion to states in 2022, representing a 20% increase compared to 2021.
•Residential Construction: Residential construction includes single family homes and multi-family units such as apartments and condominiums. Demand for residential construction is influenced primarily by population growth, new household formation, and mortgage interest rates.
•Non-Residential Construction: Non-residential construction includes a wide variety of privately financed construction including manufacturing and distribution facilities, industrial complexes, office buildings, and large retailers and wholesalers. Demand for non-residential construction is driven primarily by population and economic growth, in addition to segment-specific factors such as the growth of e-commerce, changes in retail patterns, changes in office occupancy trends, and numerous other factors.
•Specialty/Other: Our products are used in various other end markets including energy-related activities such as drilling pads, roads and major downstream projects, agriculture/horticulture, and industrial uses.
In 2021, we had shipments of approximately 34 million tons of aggregates and specialty materials, including approximately 4 million tons of recycled aggregates. Texas is our largest geographic market, representing approximately 50% of the segment's revenues in 2021. We primarily serve the Texas Triangle formed by the Dallas-Fort Worth metro at its northern point in North Texas; the Houston metro at its southeastern edge on the Gulf Coast; and Austin-San Antonio at its western tip in Central Texas. The outlook for construction spending in Texas is favorable, supported by increased spending on highways in the near-term, with current fiscal year planned Texas Department of Transportation lettings up 7% to approximately $10.2 billion, and a robust long-term outlook supported by the state’s 10-year Unified Transportation Program identifying approximately $75 billion of infrastructure projects. Population and household formation growth have contributed to a strong residential housing market, with housing permits, an indication of future construction activity, up 17% in Texas in 2021 compared to the previous year. Non-residential construction activity, while currently negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain delays, generally follows a strong residential construction cycle on a lagged basis. 
Customers and Competitors
For natural and recycled aggregates and specialty materials, our customers include concrete producers; commercial, residential, highway, and general contractors; manufacturers of masonry and building products; and state and local governments.
Shipments of natural and recycled aggregates from an individual quarry or stationary crushing location are generally limited in geographic scope because the cost of transportation to customers is high relative to the value of the product itself. Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets and, in certain locations, offer portable crushing services at a job site for re-use onsite. Proximity of our active quarries, stationary crushing locations, and strategic reserves to demand centers serve as barriers to entry.
The U.S. aggregates industry is a highly fragmented industry with more than 5,000 producers nationwide. We compete, in most cases, with natural and recycled aggregates producers in the regions where we operate. Many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to extend their current market positions or enter new markets.
Our specialty materials products enjoy higher barriers to entry than our natural aggregates due to specific mineral properties, specialized manufacturing, or additional processing. Due to the added value in processing, specialty materials have a much wider, multi-state distribution area due to their higher value relative to their distribution costs as compared to natural and recycled aggregates. We compete with specialty materials producers nationwide.
For trench shields and shoring products, our customers are equipment rental dealers and commercial, residential, and industrial contractors. We compete with shoring products manufacturers nationwide.
Raw Material and Suppliers
The primary raw material for our natural aggregates and specialty materials comes from quarries. Natural aggregates and specialty minerals can be found throughout the U.S. We have a proven and successful record of accomplishment of securing long-term reserve positions for both current and future mine locations through our employment of exploration teams and the use of professional third parties. Our reserves are critical to our raw material supply and long-term success. We currently estimate that we have 1.2 billion tons of proven and probable natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves strategically located in favorable markets that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. For further discussion of our natural aggregates and specialty materials reserves, please refer to Item 2. “Properties.”
Recycled aggregates are not dependent on reserves and the primary raw material is demolished concrete. We source raw material both internally and externally primarily from demolition and road removal projects. The demolished concrete feedstock is reported as inventory and passes through raw material, work in process, and finished goods inventory as we process it into recycled aggregates. We control a portion of our raw material needs through demolition services that we provide and source the remainder in competitive markets from third parties. Due to increasing landfill scarcity in certain markets, landfills restrict the acceptance of demolished concrete, increasing the availability of raw product at our crushing locations. Our operating permits which allow recycling activities and the strategic location of our stationary crushing sites are competitive advantages.
Engineered Structures.
Products
Through wholly owned subsidiaries, our Engineered Structures segment primarily manufactures and sells steel structures for infrastructure businesses, including utility structures for electricity transmission and distribution, structural wind towers, traffic structures, and telecommunication structures. These products share similar manufacturing competencies and steel sourcing requirements and can be manufactured across our North American footprint. This segment also manufactures storage and distribution tanks. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to our Engineered Structures products.
•Utility Structures: We are a well-established manufacturer in the U.S. and Mexico of engineered steel utility structures, including tapered steel and lattice structures, for electricity transmission and distribution. To a lesser extent, we also manufacture pre-stressed concrete poles for low voltage utility, lighting, transportation, and telecommunications markets. We acquired static cast concrete pole manufacturing competency through an acquisition in June 2020, and we believe there are opportunities to organically grow this business.
•Wind Towers: We are one of the leading manufacturers of structural wind towers in the U.S. and Mexico with plants strategically located in wind-rich regions of North America.
•Traffic Structures: We manufacture steel traffic structures for use on the U.S. highway and road system. We have two manufacturing plants serving Florida and adjacent states. Our products include overhead steel sign structures, tolling gantry structures, mast and sign arms, and other custom solutions.
•Telecommunication Structures: We manufacture telecom structures, including self-supporting lattice towers, monopole towers, and guyed towers. We have one manufacturing plant in Oklahoma and have the capability to manufacture telecom structures in our other Engineered Structures plants.
•Storage Tanks: We are one of the primary manufacturers in North America of pressurized and non-pressurized steel tanks that store and transport a wide variety of products, including propane, anhydrous ammonia, and natural gas liquids. We also manufacture fertilizer storage containers for agricultural markets, including bulk storage, farm storage, and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia.
Markets
Our Engineered Structures segment serves a broad spectrum of infrastructure markets, including electricity transmission and distribution, wind power generation, highway road construction, wireless communication, and the storage and transportation of gas and liquid products for use in residential, commercial, energy, agricultural, and industrial end markets. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from significant upgrades in the electrical grid to support enhanced reliability, policy changes encouraging more generation from renewable energy sources, the expansion of new transmission, distribution, and telecommunication infrastructure, and the replacement and growth of the U.S. highway and road system.
Our utility structures business is well-positioned to benefit from significant investment in utility infrastructure. There is strong demand for transmission and distribution structures across the U.S. as much of the utility infrastructure has aged and needs replacement. Global concerns regarding emissions have increased consumer demand for electricity. Upgrades to utility structures are needed to support larger equipment that are required to withstand growing load demand and to allow for connectivity of the grid to renewable energy sources. The IIJA, enacted in November 2021, provides $73 billion in additional federal funding to support the investment needed in the U.S. power grid.
Demand for new wind energy projects in the U.S. has been supported by the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) that was first introduced in 1992, providing a tax credit for electricity produced at each qualifying wind project. Since inception, the PTC has undergone numerous extensions and received varying levels of legislative support, contributing to volatility in the demand for new wind energy installations. In 2015, the PTC was extended for a multi-year term, with a time-based phase out of the amount of credit, dropping from 100% to 40% for new wind projects commencing construction before the end of 2016 through 2019. In subsequent years, the PTC was further extended and revised to include qualifying wind projects on which construction began in 2020 and 2021 at a 60% credit. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service generally allows four years from the start of construction of the wind project to its in-service date for the project to be eligible for the credit. As a result, under the most recent extension, the PTC supports new onshore wind projects commencing as late as 2021 and completed by 2025. Generally, orders for wind towers supporting new projects are placed approximately six to nine months ahead of project completion. Although the PTC has not been extended or renewed for new wind projects commencing in 2022 or beyond, various proposals in the U.S. Congress include renewal or expansion of the PTC. Together with the increased cost competitiveness of wind energy, state renewable fuel mandates, and increasing business acceptance of long-term decarbonization goals, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from these wind energy incentives.
We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from healthy public infrastructure spending in Florida and adjacent states and have opportunities to grow organically into new geographies as well. Additionally, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from continued spending on the buildout of 5G and other wireless networks in North America. We anticipate that the IIJA will be supportive for these businesses as well due to the increased level of highway spending and the provision for $65 billion in additional federal funding for broadband infrastructure.
Customers and Competitors
Through our recognized brands in our utility structures business, we have developed strong relationships with our primary customers, public and private utilities. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers on the basis of product quality, engineering expertise, customer service, and on-time delivery of the product. Sales to our customers, particularly certain large utility customers, are often made through alliance contracts that can extend several years. We also sell into the competitive-bid market, whereby the lowest bidder is awarded the contract, provided all other qualifying criteria are met. 
Within our wind towers business, our primary customers are wind turbine producers. We compete with both domestic and foreign producers of towers. Revenues from General Electric Company (“GE”) included in our Engineered Structures segment constituted 9.5%, 15.3%, and 18.2% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 
Our traffic structures business primarily sells to U.S. state Departments of Transportation and highway contractors typically in a competitive-bid market.
Our telecom structures business sells to wireless communication carriers and third-party tower lessors and developers. 
Our storage tanks support oil, gas, and chemical markets and are used by industrial plants, utilities, residences, and small businesses in suburban and rural areas. 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Engineered Structures segment is steel. During 2021, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. After rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2020, market steel prices during 2021 continued to increase throughout the year, reaching historic highs. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts such as flanges for wind towers. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industries to meet current production levels and our existing contracts and other relationships with multiple suppliers will meet our current production forecasts.
Transportation Products.
Products
Through wholly owned subsidiaries, our Transportation Products segment manufactures and sells inland barges, fiberglass barge covers, winches, marine hardware, and steel components for railcars and other transportation and industrial equipment. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for revenues attributable to inland barges and steel components products.
•Inland Barges: We have a leading position in the U.S. market for the manufacture of inland barges and fiberglass barge covers. We manufacture a variety of hopper barges, tank barges, deck barges, and fiberglass covers, and provide a full line of deck hardware to the marine industry, including hatches, castings, and winches for towboats and dock facilities. Dry cargo barges transport various commodities, such as grain, coal, and aggregates. Tank barges transport liquids, including refined products, chemicals, and a variety of petroleum products. Deck barges are used for transportation of heavy, oversized cargo and construction support. Our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges.
•Steel Components: We are a recognized manufacturer of steel components for railcars and other transportation equipment. We manufacture axles, circular forgings, and coupling devices for freight, tank, locomotive, and passenger rail transportation equipment, as well as other industrial uses, and provide cast components for use in the industrial and mining sectors.
Markets
Our Transportation Products segment consists of established companies that supply manufactured steel products to the transportation industry. 
Our inland barge business serves numerous end-markets through a base of established transportation customers who support the transportation of staple commodities such as grain, coal, aggregates, chemicals, fertilizers, petrochemicals, and refined products. The dry and liquid barge replacement cycles are expected to remain fundamentally strong, despite recent declines, as investments in the aging barge fleet over the last 5 to 6 years have been below long-term average replacement rates (with the exception of 2019 for liquid barges). Approximately 35% of the hopper fleet and 25% of the tank fleet are more than 20 years old. The replacement of these fleets is expected to drive healthy demand based on an assumed 25 to 30-year useful life. In the dry barge industry, scrapping has exceeded new builds every year since 2016 suggesting a strong deferred replacement cycle that we expect will be supported by a recovery in agriculture once plate steel prices normalize after increasing sharply in late fourth quarter 2020 through 2021. The liquid barge industry is poised to benefit from expected growth in the U.S. petrochemical industry and difficulty in new pipeline permitting and construction.
Our steel component business primarily serves the North American railcar industry, both the new car and maintenance markets, as well as various mining and industrial markets. Our steel components business has faced challenging market conditions as new railcar production has been in decline over the past few years. However, this market is showing signs of recovery as new railcar deliveries are expected to increase in 2022.
Customers and Competitors
Our barge manufacturing facilities are located along the U.S. inland river systems, which allows for rapid delivery to our customers. Our inland barge customers are primarily commercial marine transportation companies, lessors, and industrial shippers. While we compete with several other manufacturers in the U.S., we hold a majority share of the inland barge manufacturing market. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the expected fleet replacement cycle in both dry and liquid barges.
Our customers for our steel components businesses are primarily freight and passenger railcar manufacturers, rail maintenance and repair facilities, railroads, steel mills, and mining equipment manufacturers. We compete with both domestic and foreign manufacturers.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
The principal material used in our Transportation Products segment is steel. During 2021, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. After rising sharply in the fourth quarter of 2020, market steel prices during 2021 continued to increase throughout the year, reaching historic highs. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profit for the year. Arcosa’s manufacturing operations also use component parts, such as pumps, engines, and hardware for tank barges. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industries to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships with multiple suppliers will meet our current production forecasts.

Employee Health and Safety.
Arcosa is committed to safety across our operations. Our highest priority is the health and safety of our employees. We strive to continuously improve our procedures, processes, and management systems with regard to employee health and safety. These efforts are achieved by promoting safe work practices among employees and contractors and maintaining property and equipment in safe operating conditions. In furtherance of Arcosa’s commitment to improving our safety performance, the Company achieved improvements in certain safety metrics during 2021.
 In 2019, we launched a reenergized safety initiative, ARC 100, to build a positive and proactively engaged culture of safety excellence. ARC 100 is inspired by the voices of frontline employees, driven by cross-functional teams, and actively supported by visible commitment from senior leaders. During 2021, Arcosa experienced progress in reducing safety incidents as a result of a continued focus on building a strong safety culture through its ARC 100 safety initiative.
The outbreak and continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of focusing on the health and wellness of our employees. As an essential business, we have followed the federal, state, and local guidelines governing our facilities and shared best practices across the organization, with the goal of protecting our employees. In 2021, Arcosa continued to monitor and implement safeguards, guidelines, and best practices for COVID-19 mitigation procedures.
Diversity and Inclusion.
Arcosa values diversity and inclusion within its workforce and is committed to a work environment which promotes professionalism and inclusiveness. One of Arcosa’s core values is “We Win Together”. This belief drives our commitment to a workplace free from discrimination where collaboration, dedication, and unity align to drive favorable results for all stakeholders. We are making strides to advance diversity in our workforce and leadership team, with notable action in 2021:
•Elected Kimberly Lubel and Julie Piggott to serve on the Company's Board of Directors
•Named Gail Peck Chief Financial Officer
•Established WE~AR: Women of Arcosa as Arcosa's first Employee Resource Group
•Completed our employee Cultural Climate Engagement Survey to better understand the needs of our workforce
•Provided Blind Spots Training to employees to foster a culture of inclusion and diversity
Talent Attraction and Management.
Arcosa believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees. As part of the Company’s effort to attract and motivate employees, Arcosa offers competitive compensation and benefits, including healthcare and retirement benefits, parental and family leave, and holiday and paid time off.
Arcosa fosters employee development through a variety of leadership and training programs, tuition reimbursement at education institutions, professional society memberships, and relevant conference and symposia attendance. 
Seasonality. Results in our Construction Products segment are affected by seasonal fluctuations with the second and third quarters historically being the quarters with the highest revenues.
Intellectual Property. Arcosa owns several patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and licenses to intellectual property owned by others. Although Arcosa’s intellectual property rights are important to Arcosa’s success, we do not regard our business as being dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, or license. For a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business and Operations.”
Governmental Regulation.
Construction Products. Arcosa’s Construction Products segment is subject to regulation by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), the Health-Safety and Reclamation Code of Ministry of Mines for British Columbia, and various state agencies, and certain specialty materials are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
Engineered Structures. Arcosa’s storage tanks are subject to the regulations by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) and the U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), both of which are part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”), and various state agencies. These agencies promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining, in part, to the manufacture of tanks that are used in the storage, transportation and transport arrangement, and distribution of regulated and non-regulated substances.
Transportation Products. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Customs Service, the Maritime Administration of the USDOT, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents, and recommend improved safety standards. 
Our steel components businesses that serve the railcar industry are regulated by governmental agencies such as the USDOT and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration, and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads. All such agencies and authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. In addition to the regulations described above, our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and, within our Construction Products segment, MSHA. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against Arcosa for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
International Regulations. We ship raw materials to Mexico and manufacture products in Mexico that are sold in the U.S. or elsewhere, which are subject to customs and other regulations. In addition, we are subject to other governmental regulations and authorities in Mexico and other countries where we conduct business that regulate products manufactured, sold, or used in those countries. 
Environmental, Health, and Safety. We are subject to federal, state, and international environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S., Mexico, and each country in which we operate, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials, and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing, or nearby activities.
We cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding reserves for environmental matters.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
