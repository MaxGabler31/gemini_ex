ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We are a Nevada corporation incorporated on August 30, 2006, under the name Gateway Certifications, Inc.  On November 16, 2009, our corporate name was changed to American Jianye Greentech Holdings, Ltd. On February 13, 2014, our corporate name was changed to AJ Greentech Holdings, Ltd. and on July 17, 2017, our corporate name was changed to Sino United Worldwide Consolidated Ltd.
 
From November 2009 until October, 2013, through our China subsidiaries, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of alcohol base clean fuel which are designed to use less fossil fuel and have less pollution than traditional fuel.  
 
From October 2013 until September, 2017, through our Taiwan subsidiary, we were engaged in design, marketing and distributing of hardware and software technologies, including new cell phone apps, as well as solutions and technology in fleet management, the driving record management system (DMS) that provide total solution and management mechanism for vehicles and driver behavior control and analysis, which increase driving safety and efficiency.
 
On September 30, 2017, pursuant to agreements with one of the Company’s directors, Li-An Chu, the Company transferred the 100% ownership in its wholly owned Taiwan Subsidiary, Jinchih International Limited (“Jinchih”), to Li-An Chu in exchange for cancellation of debt of $379,254 and cancellation of total 25,503,333 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by a group of stockholders, including Li-An Chu. As a result of these transactions, Jinchih is no longer a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as of September 30, 2017, and we were no longer engaged in the DMS technology business.  We transferred the stock of Jinchih because we felt that, it not our best interest to continue DMS technology business as a result of our decreasing revenue, continued losses and inability to raise capital for our business.
 
The results of operations of Jinchih for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 were included in the loss from discontinued operation in the statements of comprehensive loss.
 The Company, led by Chairman Tee-Keat Ong, is developing new businesses in various fields through careful review and critical selection of new growth businesses as part of his strategic agendas. We are going to accelerate our product strategy by integrating technology, sales and solution marketing to ensure sustainable competitive advantage.
 
We are going to strengthen our core competencies in high technology and blockchain related businesses, such as the revolutionary sound wave technology with industrial applications, blockchain technology, fintech services, professional consultancy for ICO’s, blockchain educational programs, venture capital in ICO, crypto exchange, AI and other high potential critical blockchain projects.
