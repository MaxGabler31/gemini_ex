Item 1. Business
Company Background
 
MJ Harvest, Inc. was incorporated in Nevada in 2002. Our current business model is focused on building a vertically integrated cannabis company specializing in manufacturing operations, brand aggregation, and distribution of products utilizing ingredients derived from cannabis. Our current operations are centered in Colorado and California, and through a minority investment in PPK Investment Group, Inc. (“PPK”), an Oklahoma corporation, we have extended our market reach to Oklahoma, South Dakota and Arizona. We are currently working with our Oklahoma affiliate to further expand our business into Florida, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York. Our business model is constantly evolving to take into account the scope of our market presence, the brands included in our brand portfolio, and the relationships we have with our brands and our minority owned affiliates.
 
On August 8, 2022, we entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization dated August 8, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”) with Cannabis Sativa, Inc. (“CBDS”), to be effective on the first business day following approval of the Merger by the shareholders of MJHI and CBDS. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of MJHI with and into CBDS, with CBDS as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). The following listing summarizes material terms of the Merger Agreement.

On October 8, 2021, we entered into to two brand development agreements with WDSY, LLC (“WDSY”) and Blip Holdings, LLC (“BLIP”) for expansion of the “WEEDSY” and “BLVK” brands into Oklahoma and South Dakota. Under the agreements, PPK will manufacture and distribute these brands in Oklahoma and South Dakota and will pay the respective companies 10% royalties on all sales of the branded products in those territories. We also acquired a 10% interest in WDSY in exchange for 377,358 shares of our common stock and a 10% interest in BLIP in exchange for 188,679 shares of our common stock. Additional shares may be due to WDSY and BLIP based on lookback valuations of both companies. The lookback valuations will be based on trailing twelve months sales for WDSY and trailing three-month sales for BLIP on the second anniversary of each agreement, or sooner if the agreements are terminated before the second anniversaries.
 
As of May 31, 2022, the Company owned 25% of PPK and has the option to expand the investment in PPK to 100%. PPK continues to expand its market in the industry, with further explanation in Joint Venture with Tribal Partners. On May 19, 2021, PPK entered into a cannabis joint venture agreement with the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe of South Dakota (“FSST”). Under the joint venture agreement, PPK opened extraction and manufacturing facilities in a building located on the FSST Reservation and manufactures products for FSST utilizing biomass grown in FSST’s existing and expanding grow operations. FSST markets their products under the Native Nations Brand. PPK currently markets its products under the Country Cannabis brand. The joint venture agreement provides that PPK and FSST will now cross market the other’s brands in their respective states. This provided an opportunity for FSST to expand its Native Nations Brand to Oklahoma and for PPK to expand its Country Cannabis Brand into South Dakota. The joint venture also provides both PPK and FSST with additional capabilities, work force, and other synergies that management believes will benefit both entities. MJHI currently participates as a minority investor in PPK and expects its involvement to increase as its PPK investment commitment grows and more capital is provided to PPK and the joint venture.
 
With our acquisitions in Colorado and California and our investments in PPK, WDSY and BLIP, our long-term focus has shifted to expand our operations to include vertically integrated cannabis growing operations in Colorado, California, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, and we are actively looking at markets in Arizona, Florida New Jersey, and New York as potential areas for expansion. The timing for development of these expanded operations will depend on availability of growth capital.
 
In addition to the tribal opportunities, we have focused much of our growth efforts on acquiring interests in, and licensing agreements with, multiple other brands of cannabis products. Currently, we offer Country Cannabis (the PPK brand), Weedsy, BLVK, and Chronic brands (our “Brand Portfolio”), and we are in active negotiations to acquire interests in, and licenses with, several other brands. This focus on brand aggregation is a cornerstone of our expansion plans. We believe that our wholesale customers, consisting primarily of dispensaries, will be more receptive to our product offerings if we offer a wide range of products and price points while building our reputation as a quality manufacturer and distributor.

Prior to 2020, we were focused on building a portfolio of best-in-class agricultural and horticultural products to benefit farmers and hobbyists in their hemp and cannabis growing operations. Our first product line consisted of the Debudder Lid and EDGE products. The Debudder is used to strip buds off stems for a variety of plants, including hemp and cannabis. The patented Debudder line is wholly owned and marketed by the Company through our e-commerce sites. In 2020, we expanded our online product offerings to include the Kalix and NPK product lines, which offer customers access to plant nutrient products. While our focus has shifted toward cannabis products, we continue to offer the Debudder and the plant nutrient products through our online marketing platforms.
 
We are actively seeking to acquire and/or license additional brands, acquire and/or establish additional manufacturing and distribution operations, and acquire growing operations in the coming periods. We also continue to seek out additional agricultural and horticultural implements to add to our product offerings through distribution agreements, licensing, and acquisition. In this aspect of our business, we look for agricultural implements, durable goods, and services that will benefit smaller growers of hemp and cannabis by making their growing operations more efficient. As we increase the depth of our vertical integration, we will utilize the products from our agricultural and horticultural implements division in our operations. This will allow us to perform first-hand verification of the efficacy of the products and testimonials on our experiences with the products we offer. We also believe the customer contact and feedback from small and mid-sized growers will provide a source of prospective acquisition targets and the cannabis industry matures and consolidates in our states of operation. 
 
Strategy and Objectives
 
With our investment into PPK, PPK’s cannabis joint venture relationship with FSST, and our focus on brand aggregation, MJHI intends to take advantage of significant business development opportunities. The following business divisions are either in process, under development, or are being evaluated in an effort to assemble an enterprise covering all aspects of seed to sale operations in the cannabis and hemp-based CBD sectors.
Vertically Integrated Cannabis Operations.
 
Through our investment in PPK and our intention to increase the investment over time to make PPK a wholly owned subsidiary, we will operate as a vertically integrated cannabis company encompassing grow operations, harvesting, processing, extraction, manufacturing, distribution, and wholesale sales of a full line of products containing THC and CBD. In addition to the FSST joint venture, the Company also signed agreements with International Business Group to produce and distribute the Chronic brand of products, WDSY LLC to produce and distribute the Weedsy brand of products, and with BLIP Holdings, LLC to produce and distribute the BLVK brand of products. The agreements include a right of first refusal to offer the Chronic brand in other markets as MJHI and PPK expand their market reach. Management believes the addition of brands to the MJHI and PPK distribution system will serve to further increase the market reach of MJHI and PPK.

As a result of our brand development efforts, we became aware of an opportunity to acquire a commercial kitchen operation in Tulsa, Oklahoma with an additional distribution facility in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Working with PPK, we entered into an asset acquisition agreement with AOK Ventures, Inc. to acquire the commercial kitchen operations, including a sublease on the Oklahoma City distribution facility. The acquisition was structured with PPK acquiring the assets of AOK and with the Company providing a portion of the funding for the acquisition in exchange for a 15% increase in ownership of PPK, bringing the Company’s total ownership of PPK to 25% from the original investment of 10%. The assets acquired include exclusive distribution rights to distribute the Sublime brand of products in Oklahoma with additional opportunities to expand in other states on similar terms.
 
Joint Venture for Manufacturing and Distribution with Tribal Partner
 
With our 25% of investment in PPK referenced above we felt the expanded explanation of PPK’s joint venture was worth noting. FSST is one of 574 Native American Indian tribes recognized by the United States Government. The Flandreau Santee Sioux Reservation is situated on over 5,000 acres of land located along and near the Big Sioux River in Moody County, South Dakota. The reservation facilities include the Royal River Entertainment Complex, which is the only legal casino in South Dakota with 430 gaming devices, a 300-seat entertainment and conference center, a 120-room hotel, an adjacent RV park, plus a full-service restaurant, buffet, snack bar and lounge.
  FSST has been active in tribal cannabis since 2015 and has a state-of-the-art cultivation facility through which it has resumed cannabis cultivation after the legalization of cannabis in South Dakota in November 2020. The cultivation facility currently houses about 65 strains of cannabis and the Tribe has renovated an existing building to include a lab, kitchen, packaging, and a dispensary with drive-up service. FSST also has developed a full-line of 2018 Farm Bill Compliant hemp products which it sells under its trade name “Native Nations Cannabis.”
 
Federal recognition of the sovereign status of Native American Indian tribes under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (the “Act”) allows tribes such as the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe to manage their own affairs, including their assets, land, and mineral rights. The Act and the ensuing legislation were intended to create a sound economic foundation for the inhabitants of the reservations. Two of the main benefits of federal recognition are exemption from payment of federal taxes and exemption from many federal and state licensing requirements applicable to non-tribal companies. As a result of these advantages, many tribes have pursued business opportunities in the gaming and tobacco industries. Now, with the growing legalization of marijuana for medicinal and adult use, we believe marijuana provides a new growth area for tribes. FSST is the first tribe to expand into the marijuana industry in South Dakota. PPK and FSST have created a unique business model that is now being offered to other tribal entities in a coordinated program to grow the Native Nations brand throughout sovereign lands.
 
PPK and its Chief Executive Officer, Clinton Pyatt, have now entered into an agreement with FSST to offer the tribal program to other tribes. In each instance where a tribe agrees to follow the FSST/PPK model, PPK will serve as the manufacturer on the tribal lands in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement on retail sales revenues generated out of the tribal relationship. This also facilitates expansion of brand sales to new areas as ne tribal relationships are forged. MJHI is working closely with PPK to include the MJHI Brand Portfolio in the new tribal arrangements.

Indoor Grow Operations
 
The Company is evaluating several indoor grow operations for acquisition and/or joint venture operations but has not entered into any binding agreements or arrangements. Management believes that securing indoor grow operations will allow the Company’s operating divisions to access a consistent supply of biomass in the quality demanded by the Company’s customers. Management also believes that the acquisition of an existing indoor grow facility would allow the Company to rapidly generate operating cash flows as the biomass is processed by the Company’s own extraction and manufacturing concerns. As indicated above, PPK and FSST both have their own grow facilities in Oklahoma and South Dakota, respectively, which we believe positions us to apply best practices learned from our and their own operations to newly acquired locations. The Company, PPK, and FSST intend to continue to evaluate indoor grow facilities in locations where they are licensed to grow or manufacture products and in new markets where licenses to cultivate and process marijuana can be obtained at reasonable cost.
 
The Company is cognizant of the critical processes that must be addressed to effectively monitor and produce a quality product. Steps considered critical include cultivation monitoring, maintenance and monitoring of plant nutrients, irrigation, and lighting systems during the growing cycles, monitoring of production processes, and knowledge of the market demand for products that customers want and for which they will pay a reasonable price. Management believes all of these aspects of the business could be very efficiently driven by software applications. The Company is currently evaluating several competent software alternatives to address these critical processes and the Company expects to develop procedures and practices to obtain a competitive advantage over less sophisticated producers.
 
Disrupting Cannabis Distributor
 
Once the products are produced, the next critical phase of our strategic vision is in distribution of the products to customers where and when demanded. This is another area where management believes inventory control, data analysis to determine product demand, and delivery systems focused on getting products into the hands of the customers at the lowest delivery cost possible could be driven by software applications. The Company is currently evaluating inventory control systems, consumer data collection systems, and delivery methods to allow efficient distribution of the products to the consumer.
 
Traditionally, retail distribution is done through brick-and-mortar dispensaries. With the growing reach of Lyft and Uber, and similar business models, last mile delivery is a growth industry. We believe that software applications may also be applied to this aspect of the marijuana industry, and we are evaluating solutions that could disrupt the traditional brick-and-mortar dispensary distribution model at lower cost.

Farm Implements and Nutrient Products
 
Our goal is to become a preferred provider of agricultural and horticultural products to hemp and marijuana growers and processors. We are targeting small and medium sized commercial growers as well as the hobby farmers prevalent in many areas with recently legalized hemp and marijuana industries. We intend to continue our expansion by building distribution relationships with manufacturers of products that fit in our catalog, and by acquiring rights to manufacture and sell compatible products when those opportunities occur. In the longer term, we intend to open physical warehouse and retail locations on the east and west coasts of the United States and eventually in a central U.S. location in order to optimize logistics for our product sales and distribution efforts. As we build our product lines, we intend to become a one-stop shop for the hemp and marijuana growers looking for ways to improve yield and reduce costs of harvest and processing.
Business Concentration.
 
In the period ended May 31, 2022, our business in the Debudder product line was concentrated with 96% of our debudder sales going to four customers. We expect significant changes in the sources of our revenues in the coming periods and the business concentrations for the period ended May 31, 2022, may not reflect future results.
Competition
 
With our expansion into the vertically integrated cannabis space through our investment in PPK, we will be subject to competition for a wide range of industry participants, and we expect competition to intensify in the coming periods. We are currently evaluating our sources of direct competition in the California, Colorado, Oklahoma, and South Dakota markets where MJHI and PPK are currently operating and will report on competition experienced as we develop our history of selling products in these regions.
 
In our sector of farm implements and nutrient products, the direct competition for distribution of the “picks and shovels” needed by the small growers is significantly less congested. There are some retail offshoots from brick-and-mortar businesses like hydroponics shops that offer a range of tools and implements similar to the Company’s product offerings, and these businesses are likely to compete directly with the Company’s offerings. To date we are not aware of any large nationally recognized distributors of like products, and we are attempting to position ourselves as a player at the national level through online sales. There are significant hurdles to accomplishing this objective, most significantly, availability of capital to build and maintain the online information needed for a comprehensive “one-stop-shop” offering. If we are unable to find the necessary capital to build our product lines and our online presence, we are likely to face increasing competition as other players enter the market. This could have a negative impact on our ability to grow our revenues and compete effectively in the future.
 
10

 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our competitive advantages are derived from our ability to pursue opportunities when and where we find them without getting bogged down in the bureaucracy that a larger and more diverse business might face. As a small publicly traded company, we are able to move quickly, rapidly negotiate and document licensing and distribution agreements, and when appropriate, acquisitions.
 
With the acquisition of our interest in PPK and the Country Cannabis Brand, and our desire to increase our ownership of PPK to a majority position (up to 100%), we are also now seeking competitive advantages in our market areas by expanding the brand pool available to MJHI and PPK for distribution through our growing sales force. By adding brands, including Chronic, Sublime, Weedsy and BLVK, MJHI and PPK are providing additional products to offer dispensaries as a one stop shop. We expect that this will generate increased order size per sales visit and a reduction of selling cost per product across our entire distribution network.
 
Marketing and Distribution
 
Our business model now includes marketing of products to wholesale customers and actively seeking new business opportunities for expansion.
 
A significant part of our current business model involves manufacture and distribution of products to wholesale customers, consisting primarily of dispensaries. In order to effectively sell to these wholesale customers, MJHI and PPK have and are growing our sales force for each location/area, broken down primarily by each state in which we operate. This allows our sales teams to become familiar with the laws and regulations governing cannabis sales in their state of operation and allows each team to get to know the markets, customers, and demographics of the users. Our Brand Portfolio gives each dispensary the ability to tailor its orders to meet the demands of its retail customers in terms of product type, price point, and brand recognition. We believe there is value in calling on our customers and face-to-face visits, but we also maintain an online store and information site to provide customers with that avenue or shopping if desired.
 
In order to keep a steady stream of acquisition prospects and brands, we are actively searching for business opportunities in the cannabis industry. Our searches are done through word of mouth, attendance at trade shows and industry events, and by monitoring the activities in our states of operations. When we identify an interesting prospect, our CEO reaches out personally to the management team of the prospect to see if there is a basis for furthering discussions. Our management team has a long history in the industry and large networks of contacts which provide leads on business prospects. Collectively, we believe we will be able to capitalize on these various connections to build a broad-based business selling products to our customers in the cannabis space.
 
Historically, our product offerings have been limited to the debudder product line and additional soil enhancement products that we distribute for other manufacturers. We will continue to develop these capabilities as resources allow. Our primary marketing method for the existing products is through our online shopping site. and through a small number of distributors that offer the debudder products to their customers. We do not expect the debudder to be a significant contributor to revenues or profits in the foreseeable future, but we intend to continue our efforts to grow the business.
  11

 
Manufacturing
 
Vertically Integrated Cannabis Operations. Through our agreements with Dragon Originals in Colorado and Satellite DIP LLC in California, we are now actively engaged in manufacturing, packaging and distribution of cannabis products in Cathedral City, California and in Denver Colorado through a sub operation agreement with PPK. Our close relationship with PPK has allowed us to supplement our manufacturing knowledge and experience with the expertise gained by PPK through many years of hands-on manufacturing, product development, quality control and packaging of similar products. Both the Colorado and California locations were start-ups requiring equipment set-up, training, process creation, and adjustments of manufacturing systems. Both locations are now producing high quality products for sale and our manufacturing processes continue to improve as our workforces becomes more seasoned and as our familiarity with the manufacturing equipment increases. We expect to continue building our integrated systems in conjunction with PPK and are focused on adopting best manufacturing practices where feasible.
 
Farm Implements and Nutrient Products. We are not currently manufacturing any products in our own facilities. We rely on third party manufacturers for our production runs, and currently have relationships with third party companies for the manufacturing our products, primarily with Chinese companies. We are monitoring the China tariff situation closely and will take appropriate steps to find new contract manufacturing capabilities in other countries should the China tariffs cause a significant impact on our business. Management believes that alternative manufacturers are available, both in the United States and in other industrialized nations, but it is likely that such other sources of manufacturing would only be available at increased cost. Given current gross margins on the debudder line, an increase in costs may impact the long-term viability of the debudder product line. The molds used to manufacture our products were built by Eco Molding Co., Limited in Guandong, China. We own the molds, but it is our understanding that the molds may not be transferred out of China. Consequently, if an alternate manufacturer outside of China becomes necessary, we may be forced to incur the cost of a new mold, which could further affect the viability of the debudder product line. We do not currently have any outstanding contracts with Eco Molding for production of our product and have historically operated on the basis of purchase orders. Our last order for product was for 10,000 units of the Debudder Edge product. We received our final shipment of these units during the year, and they are currently held in inventory for sale to customers. At current inventory and sales levels, we expect that another product order will be necessary in the latter half of 2023.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property consists of business trade secrets regarding methods of operation, product formulations, and business practices. This category is applicable across all sectors of our business, is not protected by patent or other intellectual property laws, and is held in confidence by our employees by agreement.
 
12

 
In the farm implements sector, we have two design patents, and several foreign patents covering our debudder products. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued our patents on October 8, 2019. Design Patent D862180 covers the original Debudder Bucket Lid, and Design Patent D862281 covers the Debudder Edge.
 
Our business strategy will continue to focus on intellectual property protections when appropriate. As we research additional products to include in our product catalogue, we include an analysis of the level of protection that is available for such product as an element of our decision to pursue licensing or distribution of that product. Our preference is to license or distribute products that have intellectual property protections, either because of patent pending or patented status, or as a result of trade secrets.
 
We also own the domains for mjhi.com, mjharvestinc.com, and procannagro.com. We utilize mjhi.com as our primary domain, website address, and e-mail server address. Procannagro.com is our online shopping site and web-based sales tool. Mjharvestinc.com is being phased out in favor of mjhi.com but will likely be retained to protect against confusion caused by third party use if we were to abandon the domain and it became available for others.
 
Government Regulation
 
The United States federal government regulates drugs in large part through the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. Marijuana, which is a form of cannabis, is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. As a Schedule I controlled substance, the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, considers marijuana to have a high potential for abuse with no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States (except as disclosed below for epilepsy and related syndromes) and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. According to the U.S. federal government, cannabis having a concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, greater than 0.3% is marijuana. Cannabis with a THC content below 0.3% is classified as hemp.
 
The scheduling of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance is inconsistent with what we believe to be widely accepted medical uses for marijuana by physicians, researchers, patients, and others. Moreover, as of July 29, 2022, and despite the clear conflict with U.S. federal law, 37 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical use, while 19 of those states and the District of Columbia have legalized the adult-use of cannabis for recreational purposes.
 
As further evidence of the growing conflict between the U.S. federal treatment of cannabis and the societal acceptance of cannabis, the FDA on June 25, 2018, approved Epidiolex. Epidiolex is an oral solution with an active ingredient derived from the cannabis plant for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older. This is the first FDA-approved drug that contains a purified substance derived from the cannabis plant. In this case, the substance is cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical component of marijuana that does not contain the psychoactive properties of THC.
 
13

 
Marijuana is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. State laws regulating marijuana are in conflict with the CSA, which makes marijuana use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the United States authorize medical or adult-use marijuana production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under United States federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of marijuana and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal. We are compliant with the applicable state and local laws in states where we do business, but strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve us of liability under United States federal law nor provide a defense to any federal criminal action that may be brought against us.
 
In 2013, as more and more states began to legalize medical and/or adult-use marijuana, the federal government attempted to provide clarity on the incongruity between federal law and these state-legal regulatory frameworks. Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of DOJ memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013, which we refer to as the Cole Memorandum.
 
The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a standard with which marijuana-related businesses must comply. The Cole Memorandum put forth eight prosecution priorities:
 

1. | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------


2. | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Preventing the state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
On January 4, 2018, former United States Attorney General Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum by issuing a new memorandum to all United States Attorneys, which we refer to as the Sessions Memo. Rather than establishing national enforcement priorities particular to marijuana-related crimes in jurisdictions where certain marijuana activity was legal under state law, the Sessions Memo simply rescinded the Cole Memorandum and instructed that “[i]n deciding which marijuana activities to prosecute... with the [DOJ’s] finite resources, prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions.” Namely, these include the seriousness of the offense, history of criminal activity, deterrent effect of prosecution, the interests of victims, and other principles.
  14

 

Merrick Garland was confirmed to serve as Attorney General in the Biden administration. US Attorney General Merrick Garland currently has no plans to reinstate the Cole Memo or pass new legislation.
 
Garland stated in April 2022 that cannabis prosecutions are “not an efficient use of resources given the opioid and methamphetamine epidemic that we have,” indicating that the Biden Administration has no intention of repealing Sessions’ memo. While he has made it increasingly clear that he and his administration have no plans of federally prosecuting cannabis users, decriminalization has come to a stagnant point in federal policy, although efforts at federal legalization continue.
 
While the Cole Memorandum will be informally adhered to and treated as precedence, there are no confirmed efforts to recodify the DOJ’s official legal stance on cannabis law. Both Republicans and Democrats are currently pushing for comprehensive federal reform. Bipartisan congressional groups have even put forth a bill aiming to amend current legislation and model cannabis regulation after existing alcohol regulations. 
 
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 
We are not aware of other specific governmental regulations that impact our business. We do, however, utilize Chinese vendors for manufacturing a significant portion of the products we sell. To the extent that tariffs are imposed on imported goods manufactured in China, our pricing structure and acceptance in the marketplace may be affected. We currently stock our products through distributors in foreign countries when appropriate and ship direct from our manufacturer to the foreign distributor when such can be done at a cost savings. We intend to continue to explore ways that we can hold our costs down on the products we sell in order to minimize price sensitivity concerns with our customers.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We are not aware of any environmental laws that would limit our ability to conduct our current sales and distribution activities in their present form. As we expand our operations to participate more directly in the cannabis and hemp industries, and become a vertically integrated grower, harvester, processor, manufacturer, and distributor of cannabis and hemp products, we will likely be subject to environmental laws, including water usage, recycling, waste disposal, and similar regulations that will vary depending on the location of our facilities. We intend to address the impact of such environmental regulations when we have a specific use case to evaluate.

General Development of our Business
 
Our long-term plan is to increase our ownership position in PPK, grow our cannabis manufacturing and distribution businesses in Colorado and California, and acquire additional cannabis extraction, manufacturing and distribution facilities and grow operations where we can develop additional products, build our brands, research the effectiveness of such products in real world settings, and provide concrete examples of the effectiveness of the products to our customers. This step will also allow us to expand operations into biomass production, processing, and sale of products containing THC and CBD.
 
We also intend to focus on expansion of our cannabis operations into new states and regions through our relationship with PPK and PPK’s ability to expand through tribal relationships under the auspices of FSST.
 
We can offer no assurances that we will be able to accomplish any portion of our long-range vision.
 
Employees
 
Prior to the Colorado and California acquisitions, all of our day-to-day tasks were outsourced to consultants and independent contractors who provided services to us as needed and as directed by our Chief Executive Officer. With the Colorado and California acquisitions, as of September 23, 2022, we have fifteen total employees of whom are full-time, and all of whom work in our California facility. We have outsourced operations of our Colorado location to PPK and PPK employs five workers at that location. We also have five contractors regularly providing services to the Company.
 
Day to day operations are managed by our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and their activities are monitored by our Board of Directors. As business activities require and capital resources permit, we intend to hire employees to fulfill our Company’s needs.
 
Facilities
 
The Company has manufacturing facilities located at 4093 Jackson Street, Denver, CO 80216 and, as of July 2022, 68350 Commercial Road, Cathedral City, CA 92234. Both locations are leased and are considered adequate for the commercial manufacturing operations conducted there. Neither location has equipment that is owned or leased by us that is material to our manufacturing operations as of yearend. We do not maintain any principal executive offices for the Company.

In addition, each of our officers and directors and regularly retained contractors operate out of home or virtual offices. We are able to meet remotely as needed. In our farm implement and plant nutrients business segment, our physical products are placed at third-party fulfillment centers and are shipped direct to our customers by the fulfillment centers or drop shipped directly from the manufactures of the products we distribute.
 
COVID-19
 
The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses have and could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts to the Company, including our ability to operate. As of September 23, 2022, there were no material adverse impacts to our operations due to COVID-19.
 
The economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 could also adversely impact the impairment risks for certain long-lived assets. Management evaluated these impairment considerations and determined that no such impairments occurred as of May 31, 2022.
