Customers may pay us a monthly fee, based on a subscription plan which may be waived or refunded for certain customers, for which we provide them access to our platform. We have been, and in the future potentially could be, compensated directly by the USPS and/or other carriers for shipping labels printed that meet certain requirements. For an update on certain historical arrangements, see "Risk Factors--Risks Related to our Industry--The discontinuation of certain financial compensation arrangements with the USPS will have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results, unless we are successful in replacing the lost revenue and profit with similar compensation from the USPS or other potential partners, of which there is no assurance." We may earn revenue from customers that have access to our platform when they purchase postage or print shipping labels. We may earn revenue that may take the form of some or all of the spread between the rate a customer pays and the rate the carrier or integration partner receives, either charged directly or paid by our partners. We may earn other types of revenue shares or other compensation from specific customers that have access to our platform or through integration partners.

(1) | Our solutions allow customers to easily access more than 450 domestic and international carriers from a single user interface;


(2) | Our solutions support all of a customer’s selling channels from a single user interface including multiple marketplaces, shopping carts, their own websites and e-commerce platforms;


(3) | Our solutions allow customers to organize their daily shipping tasks such as search, filter and combining orders into a single unified list;

(6) | Our solutions provide a complete record of all packages sent with the ability to retrieve delivery status information quickly and easily;


(7) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to generate a single bar-coded form that represents multiple packages in a single shipment so that the USPS can scan the single form to accept all of the packages at once and the customer gets a record that all the packages were accepted by the USPS; and


(8) | Our solutions allow customers to send USPS packages with the value of the postage hidden, which is a useful feature for e-commerce shippers that may not want the recipient to see actual shipping cost information.

Our shipping customers save money in a number of ways including: 

(1) | Our solutions allow customers to receive discounts for most USPS packages;


(2) | Our multi-carrier solutions allow customers to optimize between carriers by selecting the lowest cost option based on package size, weight, destination distance and delivery times;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Small Businesses and Large Enterprises
Our small business and large enterprise customers can also save money in a number of ways including: 

(1) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to receive discounts on single piece First Class letter postage rates compared to USPS post offices and other retail USPS locations;


(2) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to receive a discounted rate for most USPS packages compared to USPS.com or retail postal rates;


(3) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to calculate the exact amount of postage that is required for a mail piece or package depending on mail class, mail form, weight and distance to the destination which allows our customers to avoid overpaying for postage;

(5) | Our USPS solutions provide customers with advanced reporting and administrative controls that improve the tracking and control of postage spend allowing customers to proactively manage and reduce their postage spend. The advanced reporting and controls capability is particularly relevant to our large enterprise customers who are managing postage across multiple locations; and

Our small business and large enterprise customers can also save time in a number of ways including: 

(1) | Our USPS solutions allow small business customers to mail or ship from their home, office, warehouse or business 24 hours a day, 7 days a week avoiding the time that would ordinarily be spent on a trip to the post office or other retail shipping locations;


(2) | Our USPS solutions allow customers to generate mass mailings quickly and easily by printing the address and postage together in a single step process. In addition, printing the address and postage together saves customers time on a single mail piece or package by combining a two-step process into a one-step process that produces more professional looking mail;


(3) | Our solutions integrate with most small business productivity applications such as word processors, financial applications and address books so our customers can save time by utilizing these integrations to print postage through their existing applications; and

The electronic reporting provides greater visibility into postage activity compared to other USPS solutions such as post offices and traditional meters. The advanced reporting and controls capability is particularly relevant to our large enterprise customers who are managing postage spend across multiple locations.

2019 Business Strategy
Mailing and Shipping Business
Our 2019 Mailing and Shipping business strategy includes the initiatives and plans listed below. These initiatives and plans are subject to change without notice based on our analysis of market and business conditions, and constitute “forward-looking statements,” and accordingly are subject to the cautionary statements, qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements we discuss at the beginning of Part I of this Report.
(1) Leverage our portfolio of mailing and shipping solutions to drive growth. 
With the acquisitions of Endicia, MetaPack, ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks, we now have a full and diverse suite of solutions across these brands, and we believe that we have a complete product and robust solution that will meet the needs of our current and of our target domestic and international customers. Our customers’ needs vary based on their specific situations including: (1) specific technology or operating system support such as Windows versus Mac and web-based versus client-based solutions; (2) breadth and depth of product features; (3) product ease-of-use which is often traded off versus product capability and complexity; (4) ease and speed for processing large volumes of packages in the fewest number of steps; (5) breadth and depth of integrations with partner solutions such as e-Commerce tools, shopping carts, and online marketplaces; and (6) number of private carriers supported (e.g., DHL, FedEx, UPS, regional carriers, international carriers, etc.). Our goal is to be able to meet the needs of as many customers as possible so that we can maximize our customer acquisition, maximize our average annual revenue per paid customer (ARPU), reduce our monthly customer cancellation rates, or churn, and increase overall customer usage. 
 (2) Invest for growth in the shipping part of our business.
Our shipping customers include e-commerce merchants, warehouses, fulfillment houses, large retailers and other types of shippers. E-commerce shipping is the fastest growing part of the mailing and shipping industry. According to quarterly U.S. Census Bureau Retail E-Commerce Sales reports, U.S. e-commerce sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 grew approximately 15% over e-commerce sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. According to the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics, 2017 e-commerce sales by businesses in the UK non-financial sector with 10 employees or more grew 16% over 2016 sales. Accordingly, a large percentage of our company investments are being made to target e-commerce shippers. For 2019 and beyond we expect to continue making these large investments in order to attract these types of shippers to our solutions. Shipping customers are more expensive to acquire than small business customers but yield higher longer-term returns on investment with their typical characteristics including higher ARPU and lower churn when compared to other small businesses that predominately use our services to send mail. 
(3) Expand the features and functionality of our solutions, particularly in the shipping part of our business.
We plan to continue to enhance our technology and solutions for our target customers that include e-commerce merchants, warehouses, fulfillment houses, large retailers and other types of shippers. We plan to enhance and add new features and functionality that will improve the value proposition of our solutions for shippers. We plan to add new integrations for easier data export and import from the tools that customers use and add new carrier and partner integrations. We plan to continue to build our support for new products such as inventory management, customer management and mobile solutions. We also plan to continue offering services such as our international shipping program, which bundles international shipping with valuable customer benefits such as free package pickup, free insurance, upgraded delivery speeds, enhanced tracking, simpler customs procedures, and other benefits.
(4) Increase our sales and marketing investment.
Based on recent analysis and trends, we expect to get a strong return on our investment from our mailing and shipping customers because they have a high expected lifetime value relative to the expected cost of acquiring those customers. Accordingly, we plan to increase our total sales and marketing expense in 2019 versus 2018. We plan to continue increasing our investment in direct sales, direct mail, traditional media, radio, television, search engine marketing, search engine optimization as well as refining our customer acquisition process through affiliates, partners, telemarketing and other areas.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(5) Enhance our enterprise solutions sales and marketing efforts. 
Our solutions targeted at enterprise customers continue to have a stronger customer value proposition compared to postage meters and our customers continue to be attracted to our enterprise solution versus a postage meter. We believe this customer preference is based on our lower total cost of ownership and the greater visibility into individual employee activity available from our centralized front-end reporting tool that has capabilities that are not available with a postage meter, such as real time data, improved web-based postage management tools, and enhanced web-based financial and administrative controls for central decision makers. For 2019 we plan to increase, optimize and refine our enterprise customer lead generation and sales and marketing efforts. 
Customized Postage
In 2019 we plan to continue marketing customized postage, but with limited spending and expectations. In recent years, we reduced our consumer-focused marketing spending in order to lower our customer acquisition costs and improve our expected returns and profitability in the customized postage business. We plan to continue our programs of focused direct-to-website marketing spending with a goal of keeping the overall cost per acquisition at a level that provides an attractive financial return. We also plan to continue our efforts to generate high volume business orders which have become a larger part of our customized postage business in recent years. 
Competition
We compete with all of the alternate ways that consumers and businesses may access the services of the USPS, including retail mailing and shipping locations, USPS online products, USPS software solutions, traditional postage meters, and other USPS-approved PC Postage products. We also compete with other multi-carrier products, e-commerce products with shipping capabilities, shipping technology products available from private carriers, package manifesting systems, and large enterprise software solutions with shipping functionality such as transportation management, warehouse management, or enterprise resource planning systems. 
Retail Mailing and Shipping Locations
The majority of our small business customers use our USPS solutions as an alternative to visiting USPS or other retail locations. The USPS owns and operates approximately 31,000 retail post offices across the United States. Many of the USPS retail post offices also feature a USPS kiosk for self-serve mailing and shipping services with more convenient access and over extended access hours. The USPS authorizes thousands of additional contract post offices, community post offices and village post offices which allow third parties to operate post offices that are not owned by the USPS, such as those available in Hallmark stores. We also compete for mailing and shipping customers with alternatives such as postage stamps and prepaid USPS shipping labels available at grocery stores and at discount chains such as Costco. We also compete with USPS mailing and shipping services available at small business mailing and shipping centers such as UPS Stores or FedEx Offices stores, and those available inside office supply stores. Further, we have not been approved to offer our customers “Forever” postage rates, which are rates that do not ever expire and do not require extra postage following a postage rate increase. 
We believe customers choose our products over retail mailing and shipping services because of the convenience of our solution, the breadth of features we offer, the quality of our support organization and ability to mail or ship from their home or business without making a trip to retail locations. We believe customers choose retail locations over our solutions because of the additional fees that we typically charge, the convenience of utilizing a retail location, and/or the preference for a Forever postage label.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USPS Online Products
We compete with online services available at USPS.com. Users of USPS.com are able to print shipping labels using similar tools that we offer. But the services and features available at USPS.com are provided without service fees, creating a disadvantage for us because we typically charge service fees in our business model. The services at USPS.com also integrate well with other USPS online services such as package tracking, post office locators, and other USPS services. Additionally, USPS.com accepts PayPal for payment of postage but we are not approved to do so. USPS.com also features a mobile application for more convenient customer access to USPS services.
USPS services are also integrated directly into web shipping solutions available through Amazon.com, eBay, and PayPal. Sellers operating within these marketplaces may purchase USPS shipping labels in a convenient manner as part of the standard checkout flow. In all of these online marketplaces, customers can print postage for shipping without paying a monthly service fee like we typically charge. These solutions also feature USPS package rate discounts that are similar to ours, and in some cases superior to the discounts we are approved to offer customers. For postage payment, these web shipping solutions use the USPS’s electronic verification system (eVS), the USPS’s solution branded ePostage or another approved USPS PC postage vendor. 
We believe customers choose our solutions over USPS online products because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our support organization. We believe customers choose USPS online products to meet their shipping needs over our solutions because of the additional fees that we may charge and/or the convenience of using one of these online products. 
USPS Software Solutions
We compete with USPS private-labeled downloadable software and API (application program interface) solutions which are offered under the brand names Click-N-Ship Business Pro and USPS Web Tools. These solutions are targeted at higher volume business users or partners and include enhanced features for higher volume customers compared to those available at USPS.com. For postage payment, these solutions utilize the USPS’s electronic verification system (eVS), or utilize the USPS’s solution branded ePostage, which are two similar systems for providing access to USPS shipping without needing PC Postage. eVS and ePostage offer more convenient solutions to higher-volume shippers with certain advantages over our PC Postage products such as: (1) labels can be printed “offline” without requiring an internet connection; (2) labels are not charged to a customer’s account until they are inserted into the mail stream; (3) eVS/ePostage labels do not expire and can be used at any time; (4) eVS/ePostage labels do not need to be saved and submitted for refunds; and (5) eVS/ePostage labels are able to support certain USPS returns products. However, we do offer our own eVS products that have some of the same capabilities. Additionally, all USPS software solutions are made available to customers with no additional monthly or transaction fees, and they may also be offered with discounts on the postage rates that are superior to the discounts that we are able to provide to our customers.
We believe customers choose our solutions over USPS software solutions because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose USPS software solutions over our solutions because of the additional fees that we may charge, the convenience of using one of these software products, and/or the package rates which are offered to the customer and which may be superior to the package rates we offer.
Traditional Postage Meters
We compete with traditional postage meters offered by FP Mailing Solutions, Hasler, Neopost, and Pitney Bowes in the U.S. market. Postage meters offer customers a simple user interface and often work better in a higher volume mail preparation process since postage meters can add postage after an envelope has already been stuffed and sealed, and can automatically weigh an envelope and add the appropriate postage. Additionally, more expensive postage meters can add postage to envelopes at rates that are faster than postage can be added using our USPS solutions since we are limited by the speed of an office printer.
We believe that customers choose our mailing and shipping services over traditional postage meters because of our lower total cost of ownership and/or the greater visibility and financial controls we provide and which are not readily available with postage meters. We believe customers choose postage meters over our solutions because of the ease of use, speed, and/or convenience of those products.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Other USPS-Approved Vendors
We compete with EasyPost and Pitney Bowes which, in addition to Stamps.com and Endicia, are USPS-approved PC Postage providers. We also compete with Shippo which is an approved USPS ePostage provider.
Pitney Bowes is the current leader in the U.S. traditional postage meter business and offers software and web-based PC Postage services and integrations similar to our mailing and shipping services and integrations under the brand names pbSmartPostageTM and SendProTM. Pitney Bowes also offers shipping APIs that customers and partners can integrate with Pitney Bowes solutions to obtain shipping labels. Pitney Bowes shipping APIs facilitate the web shipping solutions available through eBay and PayPal where sellers operating within those marketplaces may purchase USPS shipping labels in a convenient manner.
We believe that our customers choose our mailing and shipping solutions over those of other PC Postage providers because of our superior user interface, our larger breadth of features, our extensive partner integrations and our quality of customer service and support. For example, (1) we are the only mailing and shipping service that is tightly integrated into the native capabilities of Microsoft Office for use with Office’s mailing capabilities such as mail merge and envelope printing; (2) we support more address books than any other PC Postage software; and (3) we are the only company that offers customers the additional choice of our Themed and Photo NetStamps labels. Based on USPS data and our estimates, we believe we have the highest number of PC Postage customers of any PC Postage provider.
Private Carrier Technology Solutions
We compete with private carriers who offer their own shipping technology solutions such as FedEx Ship Manager, FedEx.com, UPS WorldShip, and UPS.com. These private carrier solutions are provided at no cost to the customer and in many cases also include free implementation, free hardware such as printers or scales, and free consumables and other supplies. When customers evaluate carriers’ technology solutions, among other factors, they consider the cost and complexity of the technology product needed to access a particular carrier’s services. 
We believe customers choose our solutions over private carrier technology solutions in order to utilize the package services of the USPS, to access multiple carriers from a single interface and because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features that we offer, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose private carrier technology solutions over our solutions when they decide to utilize one of the private carriers instead of the USPS, as well as because of the additional free implementation, hardware or supplies the carrier offers, the quality of the carrier’s sales and support organization, and/or the technical capabilities of the private carrier’s solution. In some cases a customer may use both our USPS solution and a private carrier technology solution to meet their different needs.
Multi-Carrier E-commerce Solutions
MetaPack, ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks provide multi-carrier solutions targeted at shippers such as warehouses, fulfillment houses, e-commerce shippers, large retailers, and other types of high volume shippers enabling the use of more than just the USPS for their business. In this area of our business, we compete with alternative means available to those categories of customer, including: other similar multi-carrier solutions (some of which are offered for free for lower volume users); warehouse and transportation management systems that offer multi-carrier shipping capabilities; package manifesting systems; e-commerce shopping carts that offer multi-carrier shipping solutions; and inventory management solutions or listing management solutions that offer multi-carrier solutions. 
We believe customers choose our multi-carrier e-commerce products over alternative solutions because of the capabilities and performance of our products, the breadth of features we offer, the value of our product, and the quality of our sales and support organization. We believe customers choose other multi-carrier e-commerce solutions over our solutions because of the higher fees that we may charge, the convenience of utilizing an integrated multi- carrier shipping solution as part of an overall e-commerce product, and the breadth and depth of features available in a larger enterprise solution that also includes multi-carrier shipping.

According to the statistics provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Businesses, and the Internal Revenue Service, respectively, there were approximately 6 million small businesses with 1 – 99 employees and approximately 26 million sole proprietorships in 2016. Our mailing and shipping solutions target the home office, home business, small office and small business customers. We believe that some portion of the approximately 32 million small businesses and sole proprietorships are potential customers for our solutions. 
Mailing & Shipping 
According to the USPS Fiscal 2018 Final Revenue, Pieces, and Weight by Classes of Mail and Special Services Report, the total USPS revenue was $70.8 billion during its fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Of this amount approximately $51.6 billion was represented by mail classes that are supported using our current solutions (First Class Mail, First Class Packages, International Mail, Media Mail, Parcel Select, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, and special services including Certified Mail, Return Receipt, USPS tracking and package insurance). The $51.6 billion in supported mail classes is comprised of (1) $26.0 billion in First Class mail; (2) $20.7 billion in shipping and package services; (3) $1.5 billion in international mail; (4) $0.9 billion in special services; and (5) $2.5 billion in ancillary and other mail services. We believe that some portion of the $51.6 billion in supported mail classes was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions. 
Our multi-carrier shipping solutions MetaPack, ShippingEasy, ShipStation and ShipWorks also address the potential market represented by the private carriers. According to data derived from the UPS 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, UPS earned $43.6 billion of U.S. Domestic Package segment revenue on 4.4 billion packages shipped and $14.4 billion of International Package segment revenue on 810.9 million packages shipped. According to data derived from the FedEx 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the FedEx Q2 Fiscal 2019 Statistics Report, FedEx earned $12.8 billion of U.S. FedEx Express segment package revenue on 695.9 million packages shipped, $15.2 billion on International FedEx Express segment package revenue on 830.5 million packages shipped, and $18.4 billion on FedEx Ground segment revenue on 2.1 billion packages shipped. When taken together, we estimate that the top 3 U.S. carriers (UPS, FedEx and the USPS) have domestic and international package revenue of approximately $125.1 billion. According to data derived from Deutsche Post DHL Group’s 2017 Annual Report, we estimate there is approximately $1.9 billion represented by DHL Express International shipments originating in the U.S. and $11.6 billion originating outside the U.S. We believe some portion of the approximately $138.6 billion package revenue was generated by users who are potential customers for our solutions. 
E-commerce
According to quarterly U.S. Census Bureau Retail E-Commerce Sales reports, U.S. e-commerce sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 were estimated at $497 billion, an increase of 15.0% over e-commerce sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. E-commerce sales accounted for 9.4% of total U.S. retail sales in the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 which was up from 8.6% of total retail sales in the twelve months ended September 30, 2017. According to the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics, 2017 e-commerce sales by businesses in the UK non-financial sector with 10 employees or more were estimated at £560 billion, growing 16% over 2016 sales estimated at £484 billion. We believe the growth in e-commerce sales drives growth in the number of e-commerce packages shipped and that e-commerce merchants are potential customers of our solutions. 
The PC Postage Certification and Regulatory Approval Process
Our technology must meet strict U.S. government security standards. Our PC Postage products complete extensive USPS testing and evaluation in the areas of operational reliability, financial integrity and security to become certified for commercial distribution. The USPS certification process to become an USPS-approved PC Postage vendor is a standardized extensive process. The process includes testing and reviews by the USPS and an independent test laboratory, and certification of meeting Federal Information Processing Standards. While the USPS has no published timeline or estimated time to complete the process, it took the existing approved vendors years to complete. Stamps.com was approved in 1999 and Endicia was approved in 2000.

Our Technology
Our systems are located in multiple geographically disparate high-security data centers as well as secure connected cloud infrastructure platforms. These systems create the data used to generate information-based indicia and third party certified labels. They also process postage purchases using proprietary secure technology that meets USPS security requirements. Our services currently include Windows and Mac based client applications, web-based applications, and API Integrations that support a variety of label and envelope options along with a wide range of printers. In addition, our applications employ an internally developed user authentication mechanism for additional security.
Our transaction processing servers are a combination of secure, commercially available and internally developed technologies that are designed to provide secure and reliable transactions. Our implementation of security system hardware meets government standards for security and data integrity. The performance and scalability of our PC Postage system is designed to allow many users to simultaneously process postage transactions through our system. Our database servers are designed and built with industry-leading database technologies.
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, trade name, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our rights in our products, services, know-how and information.

Geographical and Revenue Information
Geographical Information
In 2016 and 2017, primarily as a result of our Endicia acquisition, we had international revenue and assets that were less than 1% of total revenue and assets, with the remainder in the United States. In 2018, we expanded our international operations with our acquisition of MetaPack Ltd. on August 15, 2018, at which time we became subject to increased economic, political, regulatory, currency exchange, foreign tax and other risks arising from such foreign operations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business,” for a more detailed description of certain risks attendant to our foreign operations.
Revenue Information
During 2016, 2017 and 2018, we did not recognize revenue from any one customer that represented 10% or more of our total revenues.
See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Results of Operations for years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016,” for the percentage of total revenue contributed by categories of similar products or services that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenue. Our product and insurance revenues are subject to seasonal variations with the first and fourth calendar quarters being typically seasonally stronger and the second and third calendar quarters being typically seasonally slower. Our service revenue is subject to seasonal variation driven by our growth in packages shipped where the fourth calendar quarter is typically seasonally stronger due to the holiday shipping season and to a lesser extent, by customer acquisition which is typically seasonally stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters and typically seasonally slower in the second and third calendar quarters. Our customized postage revenue is typically seasonally stronger in the fourth calendar quarter due to the holidays but can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on high volume business orders.
