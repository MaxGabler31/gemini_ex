The new excel V+, expanded treatment capabilities and provided dermatologists and aesthetic providers a higher level of precision and versatility for vascular and pigmented lesions. The excel V+ continues to boast 50% more power than its predecessor (excel V) and provides a greater range of parameters for faster, more customizable treatments. excel V+ is a solid-state laser platform combining the 532 nanometers (“nm”) green laser with 1064 nm Nd:YAG technology to provide a single, compact and efficient system that treats the entire range of cosmetic vascular and benign pigmented lesion conditions. The excel V+ device includes Cutera’s signature laser genesis treatment, and introduced the ‘green genesis’ treatment – a micro-pulsed 532 treatment. 
•truSculpt iD – In July 2018, the Company introduced a hands-free version of the Company’s truSculpt platform, the truSculpt iD, for the non-surgical body sculpting market. It includes consumable cycles that need to be ordered by the practitioner after a set number of treatments are performed, resulting in recurring revenue. This product is a high-powered radio frequency (“RF”) system designed for circumferential reduction, lipolysis, and deep tissue heating and can treat all body and skin types. The truSculpt iD delivers targeted energy at 2 MHz, causing subcutaneous adipose tissue lipolysis. The Company received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for lipolysis of abdominal fat in 2018. Prior truSculpt platforms include the truSculpt 3D, a 2 MHz device for tissue heating and circumferential reduction of fat in the abdomen and flank, and the original truSculpt platform launched in August 2012 and delivered treatments at 1 MHz. In December 2016, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the truSculpt platform for the temporary reduction in circumference of the abdomen. The truSculpt 3D includes a consumable handpiece that needs to be “refilled” after a set number of treatments are performed, resulting in recurring revenue.
•Secret RF – In January 2018, the Company introduced a new fractional RF microneedling device that delivers heat into the deeper layers of the skin using controlled RF energy. The targeted energy revitalizes the tissue, via hemostasis, and coagulation of the tissue, minimizing downtime. Each time a procedure is performed, the physician must use a new handpiece tip. The sale of the replacement tip results in recurring revenue. The Company is the distributor of Secret RF.
•enlighten – In December 2014, the Company introduced the enlighten laser platform with a dual wavelength (1064 nm + 532 nm). In December 2016, the Company introduced a three wavelength model (1064 nm + 532 nm + 670 nm), enlighten III. The enlighten system is a dual pulse duration (750 picoseconds, or “ps,” and two nanoseconds, or “ns”) laser system cleared for multi-colored tattoo removal and the treatment of benign pigmented lesions and acne scars. In 2018, the Company introduced an expanded performance enlighten III, and in April 2018, the Company introduced enlighten SR, a lighter version of enlighten with reduced optical performance.

The Market for Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures
The Company believes several factors are contributing to the global growth of aesthetic treatment procedures and aesthetic laser equipment sales, including:
Table of Contents

•Growing Improvement in Economic Environment, Aesthetic Accessibility, and Expanded Practitioner Base – The improvements in overall global economic conditions since the financial crisis of 2007-2008 have created an increased demand for aesthetic procedures, which has resulted in an expanding practitioner base to satisfy the demand. An expanding practitioner base paired with digital and mobile advancements has led to a broader range of accessibility options for potential patients.
•Aging Demographics of Industrialized Countries – The aging population of industrialized countries, the amount of discretionary income available to the “baby boomer” demographic segment ─ ages 57 to 75 as of 2021 ─ and their desire to retain a youthful appearance contribute to the increased demand for aesthetic procedures. With millennials entering their 40's the demand and preference for non-invasive aesthetic treatments are also rising. Millennials who are currently entering their 30's, including those in their 30's, have been earlier adopters of aesthetic treatments in comparison to older generations.
•Broader Range of Safe and Effective Treatments – Technical developments and an increase in treatable conditions due to new product introductions, have led to safe, effective, easy-to-use, and low-cost treatments with fewer side effects, resulting in broader adoption of aesthetic procedures by practitioners. In addition, technical advancements enable practitioners to offer a broader range of treatments. These technical developments reduce treatment and recovery times, leading to greater patient demand.
•Broader Base of Customers – Managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions motivate physicians to establish or expand their elective aesthetic practices with procedures paid for directly by patients. As a result, in addition to core practitioners such as dermatologists and plastic surgeons, many other practitioners, such as gynecologists, family practitioners, primary care physicians, physicians performing aesthetic treatments in non-medical offices, and other qualified practitioners (“non-core practitioners”) expanded their practices to offer aesthetic procedures.
•Reductions in Cost per Procedure – Due partly to increased competition in the aesthetic market, the cost per procedure has decreased in the past few years. This attracts a broader base of customers and patients seeking aesthetic procedures.
•Wide Acceptance of Aesthetic Procedures and Increased Focus on Body Image and Appearance – According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery survey in 2019, both surgical and non-surgical procedures increased compared to 2015. Surgical procedures increased by 6.2%, while non-surgical procedures increased by 13.3% over this four-year period.
Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures for Improving the Body and/or Skin’s Appearance and Their Limitations
Many alternative therapies are available for improving a person’s appearance by treating specific structures within the skin. These procedures utilize injections or abrasive agents to reach different depths of the dermis and the epidermis. In addition, non-invasive and minimally invasive treatments have been developed that employ laser and other energy-based technologies to achieve similar therapeutic results. Some of these common aesthetic procedures and their limitations are described below.
Non-Invasive Body Contouring – Treatments for non-invasive body sculpting can be done utilizing a variety of technologies, including radio frequency, laser, cooling, and ultrasound. Procedures address the reduction of unwanted fat on the abdomen, flanks, arms, thighs, submentum, and back and can require one or more treatments. Systems with the ability to induce non-invasive lipolysis (breakdown of fat) offer a more permanent solution with an average fat reduction of more than 20%. Common side effects of this approach may include paradoxical hyperplasia with cooling devices, and nodules which typically resolve over time and the risk of burning the treatment area with radiofrequency devices. In June 2019, the Company introduced the truSculpt flex, a bio-electrical muscle stimulation device designed to strengthen, firm, and tone the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs. In 2021 the Company introduced truSculpt flex+, a treatment mode that decreased the treatment time from approximately 45 minutes to 15 minutes.
Tattoo removal – The most effective way to remove tattoos on the body is to utilize laser systems that deliver very short pulse durations with high peak power in order to break up the ink particles that comprise tattoos.
The global tattoo removal market was valued at $122.8 million in 2019 and is projected to reach $219.0 million by 2026. According to market research, people tend to remove their tattoos due to career choices, social conditions, personal situations, and more, which have been the key drivers for the tattoo removal market. Despite the effectiveness of lasers for tattoo removal, common complaints concerning laser tattoo removal include a low rate of complete clearance (sometimes no better than 50% after several treatments) as well as the high number of treatments for satisfactory clearance (often 10 or more treatments spaced four to eight weeks apart). However, the latest generation of tattoo removal lasers produce picosecond pulse durations, (a trillionth of a second) and thereby, can meaningfully improve tattoo clearance and reduce the total number of treatments. The Company introduced the enlighten system, a dual pulse duration laser system, that was cleared for multi-colored tattoo removal.
Hair Removal – Techniques for hair removal include waxing, depilatories, tweezing, shaving, electrolysis, laser as well as other energy-based hair removal modalities. The only techniques that provide a long-lasting solution are electrolysis, laser, and other 
Table of Contents

energy-based technology such as Intense Pulsed Light (“IPL”). Electrolysis is usually painful, time-consuming and expensive for large areas, but is the most common method for removing light-colored hair. During electrolysis, an electrologist inserts a needle directly into a hair follicle and activates an electric current in the needle. Since electrolysis only treats one hair follicle at a time, the treatment of an area as small as an upper lip may require numerous visits and many hours of treatment. In addition, electrolysis can cause blemishes and infection related to needle use. In comparison, lasers can quickly treat large areas with a high degree of safety and efficacy. In 2003, the Company introduced the xeo system platform utilized for hair removal, which combines intense pulse light technology with laser applications in a single system. In 2014, the Company introduced the excel HR platform, a premium hair removal solution for all skin types, combining the Company’s proven long-pulse 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser and a high-power 755 nm Alexandrite laser with sapphire contact cooling.
Skin Revitalization – Skin revitalization treatments include a broad range of popular alternatives, including Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion, radio frequency treatment and laser and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients hope to improve overall skin tone and texture, reduce pore size, tighten skin and remove other signs of aging, including mottled pigmentation, diffuse redness and wrinkles. All of these procedures are temporary solutions and must be repeated within several weeks or months to sustain their effect, thereby increasing the cost and inconvenience to patients. For example, the body absorbs Botox and collagen, and patients require supplemental injections every three to six months to maintain the benefits of these treatments.
Other skin revitalization treatments, such as chemical peels and microdermabrasion, can have undesirable side effects. Chemical peels use acidic or caustic solutions to peel away the epidermis, and microdermabrasion generally utilizes sand crystals to resurface the skin. These techniques can lead to stinging, redness, irritation and scabbing. In addition, more serious complications, such as changes in skin color, can result from deeper chemical peels.
With many modalities available today for skin revitalization and resurfacing, the Company has developed a range of clinically proven solutions uniquely paired with a patient’s lifestyle and skin concerns, such as Secret PRO, which utilizes fractional CO2 for skin resurfacing and radio frequency microneedling for deep dermal remodeling and Secret RF, a novel fractional RF microneedling system for tissue coagulation and hemostasis designed to stimulate and remodel collagen and address the common signs of aging.
RF Microneedling – Also known as collagen induction therapy, microneedling is a minimally invasive revitalization treatment that involves using fine needles to create hundreds of tiny, invisible puncture wounds in the top layer of the skin, which stimulates the body's natural wound healing processes, resulting in cell turnover and increased collagen and elastin production via hemostasis and tissue coagulation. In January 2018, the Company introduced Secret RF product, a RF fractional microneedling system. In 2020, the Company released the Secret PRO, which included the dual modality treatment options of RF microneedling and CO2 laser.
Leg and Facial Veins – Current aesthetic treatment methods for leg and facial veins include sclerotherapy, as well as laser and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients seek to eliminate visible veins, and improve overall skin appearance. Sclerotherapy requires a skilled practitioner to inject a saline or detergent-based solution into the target vein, which breaks down the vessel causing it to collapse and be absorbed into the body. The need to correctly position the needle on the inside of the vein makes it difficult to treat smaller veins, which limits the treatment of facial vessels and small leg veins. In 2019, the Company introduced the excel V+, a high-performance, vascular and benign pigmented lesion treatment platform designed specifically for the core-market of dermatologists and plastic surgeons, which treats the entire range of cosmetic vascular and benign pigmented lesion conditions.
Laser and other energy-based non-surgical treatments for hair removal, veins, skin revitalization and body contouring are discussed in the following section.
Laser and Other Energy-Based Aesthetic Treatments
Laser and other energy-based aesthetic treatments can achieve therapeutic results by affecting structures within the skin. The development of safe and effective aesthetic treatments has resulted in a well-established market for these procedures.
Practitioners can use laser and other energy-based technologies to selectively target hair follicles, veins, melanin as well as other chromophores within the epidermis and dermis, without damaging surrounding tissue. Practitioners can also use these technologies to safely remove portions of the epidermis and deliver heat to the dermis as a means of generating new collagen growth. Ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by removing the outer layers of the skin. Ablative skin resurfacing procedures are considered invasive or minimally invasive, depending on how much of the epidermis is removed during a treatment. Non-ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by treating the underlying structure of the skin.
Safe and effective laser and energy-based treatments require an appropriate combination of four parameters:
7


Table of Contents

•Energy Level – the amount of light or radio frequency emitted to heat a target;
•Pulse Duration – the time interval over which the energy is delivered;
•Spot Size or Electrode Size – the diameter of the energy beam, which affects treatment depth and area; and
•Wavelength or Frequency – the position in the electromagnetic spectrum which impacts the absorption and the effective depth of the energy delivered.
For example, in the case of hair removal, by utilizing the correct combination of these parameters, a practitioner can use a laser or other light source to selectively target melanin within the hair follicle to absorb the laser energy and destroy the follicle, without damaging other delicate structures in the surrounding tissue.
Technology and Design of the Company’s Systems
The Company’s enlighten, excel, Secret PRO, Secret RF, truSculpt and xeo platforms provide the long-lasting benefits of laser and other energy- based aesthetic treatments. The Company’s technology allows for a wide variety of applications in a single system. Key features of the Company’s solutions include:
•Multiple Applications Available in a Single System – Many of the Company’s platforms feature multiple-applications that enable practitioners to perform a variety of aesthetic procedures using a single device. These procedures include hair removal, vascular treatments and skin revitalization, which address discoloration, fine lines, and uneven texture. Because practitioners can use the Company’s systems for multiple indications, the investment in a unit is spread across a greater number of patients and procedures, and the acquisition cost may be more rapidly recovered.
•Technology and Design Leadership – The Company’s innovative laser technology combines multiple wavelengths, adjustable energy levels, variable spot sizes and a wide range of pulse durations, allowing practitioners to customize treatments for each patient and condition. The Company’s proprietary pulsed light hand pieces for the treatment of discoloration, hair removal and vascular treatments optimize the wavelength used for treatments and incorporate a monitoring system to increase safety. The Company’s Titan hand piece utilizes a novel light source not previously used for aesthetic treatments. The Company’s Pearl and Pearl Fractional hand pieces, with proprietary YSGG technology, represent the first application of the 2790 nm wavelength for minimally invasive cosmetic dermatology.
•Upgradeable Platform – The Company’s xeo, excel V and trusculpt flex products allow the Company’s customers to upgrade their system to the Company’s newest technologies or add new applications to their system, each of which provide the Company with a source of incremental revenue. The Company believes that product upgradeability allows customers to take advantage of the Company’s latest product offerings and provide additional treatment options to their patients, thereby expanding the opportunities for their aesthetic practices.
•Treatments for Broad Range of Skin Types and Conditions – For hair removal, the Company’s products are safe and effective on patients of all skin types, including harder-to-treat patients with dark or tanned skin. In addition, the wide parameter range of the Company’s systems allows practitioners to effectively treat patients with both fine and coarse hair. Practitioners may use the Company’s products to treat spider veins on the leg; to treat facial veins; and perform skin revitalization procedures for discoloration, texture, fine lines and wrinkles on any type of skin. The ability to customize treatment parameters based on skin type enables practitioners to offer safe and effective therapies to a broad base of their patients.
•Ease of Use – The Company designs its products to be easy to use. The Company’s proprietary hand pieces are lightweight and ergonomic, minimize user fatigue, and facilitate clear views of the treatment area, reducing the possibility of unintended damage and increasing the speed of application. The Company’s control console contains an intuitive user interface with simple, independently adjustable controls from which to select a wide range of treatment parameters to suit each patient’s profile. For instance, the clinical navigation user interface on the xeo platform provides recommended clinical treatment parameter ranges based on patient criteria entered. The Company’s Pearl and Pearl Fractional hand pieces include a scanner with multiple scan patterns to allow simple and fast treatments of the face. Finally, the Company’s truSculpt iD embodies the best of many of the above features. Unlike other body sculpting treatments on the market that require certain body types, or pinchable fat, truSculpt iD is “body agnostic” with the ability to customize treatments to the patient's needs and body type. In addition, the Company’s proprietary algorithms and navigation enable the practitioner to treat a 300cm2 area in only 15 minutes.

Applications and Procedures
The Company’s products are designed to allow the practitioner to select an appropriate combination of energy level, spot size and pulse duration for each treatment. The ability to manipulate the combinations of these parameters allows the Company’s customers to treat the broadest range of conditions available with a single energy-based system.
Non-Invasive Body Contouring – The Company’s truSculpt technology allows practitioners to apply a hand piece directly to the skin and deliver high-powered RF energy that results in the deep and uniform heating of the subcutaneous fat tissue at sustained therapeutic temperatures. This heating can cause selective destruction of fat cells, which are eliminated from the treatment area through the body’s natural wound healing processes. The treatment takes approximately 15 minutes and two or more treatments may be required to obtain the desired aesthetic results. The Company’s CE Mark allows the Company to market truSculpt in the EU, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for fat reduction, body shaping, body contouring and circumferential reduction. In the U.S., truSculpt has 510(k) clearance for topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for the treatment of selected medical conditions, such as relief of pain and muscle spasms and increase in local circulation. Additionally, the 2 MHz setting for the 40 cm2 hand piece is indicated for reduction in circumference of the abdomen and non-invasive lipolysis (breakdown of fat) of the abdomen. The truSculpt massage device is intended to provide a temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite.
Tattoo Removal – The Company’s enlighten systems, delivering picosecond or dual picosecond and nanosecond pulse durations are used for tattoo removal, the treatment of benign pigmented lesions, and a laser skin toning procedure that the Company refers to as PICO Genesis.
Hair Removal – The Company has two platforms, excel HR and xeo, which address hair removal for all skin types as well as hair thicknesses. The Company’s xeo platform allows practitioners to select between the 1064 nm mode for darker, course hair, and the ProWave LX hand piece designed to address finer, vellus hair. Contact cooling is present on both hand pieces for epidermal protection. excel HR employs both a 1064 nm Nd:YAG as well as a 755 nm Alexandrite for hair removal. Like the xeo, the 1064 nm wavelength addresses darker, course hair while the 755 nm wavelength is used for finer, lighter hair. Both wavelengths are transmitted through the same CoolView hand piece with spot sizes up to 18 mm for the 755 nm wavelength and up to 18 mm for the 1064 nm wavelength. The CoolView hand piece employs sapphire as a means of contact cooling – epidermal protection. Both platforms are cleared for treating all skin types.

Vascular Lesions – Both the Company’s xeo as well as excel V and excel V+ platforms are capable of treating a wide range of aesthetic vein conditions, including spider and reticular veins, and small facial veins. xeo employs the LimeLight hand piece for addressing small veins as well as vascular lesions while the Nd:YAG is appropriate for deeper, larger vessels. LimeLight is a fixed spot size IPL while the Nd:YAG has adjustable spot sizes up to 10mm. The excel V and excel V+ devices are is a dual wavelength laser – 1064 nm and 532 nm – with adjustable spot sizes ranging from 2 mm to 12 mm for excel V and 1 mm - 16 mm for the excel V+. The 532 nm and 1064 wavelength can be used to treat over 20 conditions ranging from small veins and vessels to a variety of vascular lesions. For both of these devices, patients receive on average between one and six treatments, with six weeks or longer between treatments.
Skin Revitalization – The Company’s xeo, excel V, excel HR and enlighten platforms, utilizing an Nd:YAG laser, allow the Company’s customers to perform non-invasive and minimally-invasive treatments that reduce redness, dyschromia, fine lines, improve skin texture, and treat other aesthetic conditions. When using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser to improve skin texture and treat fine lines, cooling is not applied and the hand piece is held directly above the skin. A large number of pulses are directed at the treatment site, repeatedly covering an area, such as the cheek. By delivering many pulses of laser light to a treatment area, a gentle heating of the dermis occurs and collagen growth is stimulated to rejuvenate the skin and reduce wrinkles. Patients typically receive four to six treatments for this procedure. The treatment typically takes less than a half hour with a spacing of two to four weeks between treatments. Skin revitalization was expanded with introduction of 'green genesis', a micro-pulsed 532 nm treatment on the excelV+.
Texture, Lines and Wrinkles – The xeo platform can address fine lines and wrinkles using the Pearl and Pearl Fractional hand pieces. When treating fine lines, texture and wrinkles with a Pearl hand piece, the hand piece is held at a controlled distance from the skin and the scanner delivers a preset pattern of spots to the treatment area. Cooling is not applied to the epidermis during the treatment. The energy delivered by the hand piece ablates a portion of the epidermis while leaving a coagulated portion that will gently peel off over the course of a few days. Heat is also delivered into the dermis, which can result in the production of new collagen. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
Additionally, the Company’s Secret RF and Secret PRO platforms feature Radio Frequency microneedling device that employs fractionated RF energy (2 MHz) delivered at different pre-programmed depths in the dermis to produce new collagen. The Secret devices come with four treatment tips: a 25-pin tip, both insulated and semi-insulated, and a semi-insulated 64-pin tip. The treatment has minimal side effects, negligible downtime and results in improved skin tone and texture as well as improvement in acne scars.
Dyschromia – The Company’s pulsed-light technologies allow the Company’s customers to safely and effectively treat red and brown dyschromia (skin discoloration), benign pigmented lesions, and rosacea. The practitioner delivers a narrow spectrum of light to the surface of the skin through the Company’s LimeLight hand pieces. These hand pieces include one of the Company’s proprietary wavelength filters, which reduce the energy level required for therapeutic effect and minimize the risk of skin injury.
The 532 nm wavelength green laser option of the excel V and enlighten systems, as well as the 755 nm infrared wavelength of the excel HR, can be used to treat benign pigmented lesions in substantially the same way.
In treating benign pigmented lesions, the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the pulse is triggered. The cells forming the pigmented lesion absorb the light energy, darken and then flake off over the course of two to three weeks. Several treatments may be required to completely remove the lesion. The treatment takes a few minutes per area treated and there are typically three to four weeks between treatments.
Practitioners can also treat dyschromia and other skin conditions with the Company’s Pearl hand piece. During these treatments, the heat delivered by the Pearl hand piece will remove the outer layer of the epidermis while coagulating a portion of the epidermis. That coagulated portion will gently peel off over the course of a few days, revealing a new layer of skin underneath. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
Skin Quality – The Company’s Titan technology allows the Company’s customers to use deep dermal heating to tighten lax skin. The practitioner delivers a spectrum of light to the skin through the Company’s Titan hand piece. This hand piece includes the Company’s proprietary light source and wavelength filter which tailors the delivered spectrum of light to provide heating at the desired depth in the skin.
In treating compromised skin, the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the light pulse is triggered. A sustained pulse causes significant heating in the dermis. This heating can cause immediate collagen contraction while also stimulating

long-term collagen regrowth. Several treatments may be required to obtain the desired degree of tightening of the skin. The treatment of a full face can take over an hour and there are typically four weeks between treatments.
The Company’s CE Mark allows the Company to market the Titan in the EU, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for the treatment of wrinkles through skin tightening. However, in the U.S. the Company has a 510(k) clearance only for deep dermal heating.
Sales and Marketing
The Company markets, sells, and services the Company’s products through direct sales and service employees in North America (including Canada), Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. International sales and services outside of these direct markets are made through a network of distributors in over 42 countries, as well as a direct international sales force. The Company internally manages its U.S. and Canadian sales organization as one North American sales region.
The Company also sells certain items like hand piece refills, cycle refills, consumable tips, and marketing brochures through the Company’s web site www.mycutera.com.
Customers generally demand quality, performance, ease of use and high productivity in relation to the cost of ownership. The Company responds to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets it serves. Specifically, the Company believes it introduces new products and applications that are innovative, address the specific aesthetic procedures in demand, and are upgradeable on its customers’ existing systems. In addition, the Company provides attractive upgrade pricing to new product families. To increase market penetration, the Company also markets to non-core practitioners in addition to the Company’s core specialties of plastic surgeons and dermatologists.
The Company seeks to establish strong ongoing relationships with its customers through the upgradeability of the Company’s products, sales of extended service contracts, hand piece refills and replacement disposable tips, ongoing training and support, and by distributing skincare products in Japan. The Company primarily targets its marketing efforts to practitioners through office visits, workshops, trade shows, webinars and trade journals. The Company also markets to potential patients through brochures, workshops and its website. In addition, the Company offers clinical forums with recognized expert panelists to promote advanced treatment techniques using the Company’s products to further enhance customer loyalty and uncover new sales opportunities.
Competition
The industry in which the Company operates is subject to intense competition. The Company’s products compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as electrolysis, Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion and sclerotherapy. The products also compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by other public companies, such as Abbvie (acquired Allergan and its division Zeltiq), Bausch Health (formerly Valeant Pharmaceuticals), Vieve, Soliton, InMode and Lutronic, as well as private companies, including Sisram, Candela (formerly Syneron Candela, acquired in 2017 by an affiliate of private equity funds advised by Apax Partners), Sciton, BTL Industries and several others. In late 2019, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice entered into an agreement under which its managed funds acquired Cynosure, LLC, a leader in medical aesthetics systems and technologies, from Hologic, Inc. Cynosure develops, manufactures, and markets medical aesthetic treatment systems for dermatologists, plastic surgeons, medical spas and other healthcare practitioners, with sales and distribution worldwide. In early 2020, the affiliated private equity funds of Baring Private Equity Asia completed the acquisition of Lumenis, a provider of specialty energy-based medical devices across the fields of aesthetics, urology, ophthalmology, ENT and gynecology, with an international presence. 
Competition among providers of laser and other energy-based devices for the aesthetic market is characterized by extensive research and development efforts, and innovative technology. While the Company attempts to protect its products through patents and other intellectual property rights, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that would compete directly with the Company. There are many companies, both public and private, that are developing devices that use both energy-based and alternative technologies. Some of these competitors have greater resources than the Company does or product applications for certain sub-markets in which the Company does not participate. Additional competitors may enter the market, and the Company is likely to compete with new companies in the future. To compete effectively, the Company has to demonstrate that the Company’s products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments by differentiating the Company’s products on the basis of performance, brand name, service and price. The Company has encountered, and expects to continue to encounter, potential customers who, due to existing relationships with the Company’s competitors, are committed to, or prefer, the products offered by these competitors. Competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced margins for the Company’s products.

The Company also sells skincare products in Japan under the exclusive distribution agreement with ZO which granted the Company the exclusive right to promote, market, sell, and distribute the products produced by ZO in Japan. ZO’s skincare products compete against other Physician-dispensed skincare brands developed and marketed by other companies, such as Environ, Navision and Revision Skincare, among others.
Research and Development
The Company focuses its research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with its mission. The Company consistently strives to understand its customers’ expectations for total excellence. The Company accomplishes this by its commitment to continuous improvement in design, manufacturing, and service, which the Company believes provides for superior products and services to ensure on going customer satisfaction, trust and loyalty. The Company seeks to comply with all applicable domestic and international regulations to maintain the highest quality.
The Company’s research and development activities are conducted by employees with a broad base of experience in lasers, optoelectronics, software, and other related disciplines. The Company develops working relationships with outside contract engineering and design consultants, giving the Company’s team additional technical and creative breadth. The Company works closely with thought leaders and customers, to understand unmet needs and emerging applications in aesthetic medicine.
Acquisitions, Investments, and Distribution Agreements
The Company’s strategy of providing a broad range of therapeutic capabilities requires a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the aesthetic device industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas make it challenging for the Company to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through research and development efforts, the Company has considered, and expects to continue to consider, acquisitions, investments, and distribution agreements to provide access to new products and technologies in both new and existing markets.
The Company expects to further the Company’s strategic objectives and strengthen its existing businesses by making future acquisitions and investments, or by entering into new distribution agreements in areas that the Company believes it can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies, as well as distribution relationships, are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any acquisition will be successful or will not materially adversely affect the Company’s consolidated operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Manufacturing
The Company manufactures its products with components and subassemblies supplied by vendors and assembles and tests each of its products at the Brisbane, California facility, and at third party contract manufacturers’ facilities. Quality control, cost reduction and inventory management are top priorities of the manufacturing operations.
The Company purchases certain components, subassemblies, and assembled systems from a limited number of suppliers. All Secret RF systems are manufactured by Ilooda Co. Ltd, who also manages all related regulatory activities. The Company has flexibility with its suppliers to adjust the number of components and subassemblies as well as the delivery schedules. The forecasts are based on historical demands and sales projections. Lead times for components and subassemblies may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components or subassemblies, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. The potential for disruption of supply is reduced by maintaining sufficient inventories and identifying additional suppliers. The time required to qualify new suppliers for some components, or to redesign them, could cause delays in the Company’s manufacturing. To date, the Company has not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of its components or subassemblies.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and non-disclosure, confidentiality, and invention assignment agreements to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights. As of January 19, 2022, the Company had 28 issued and unexpired U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, and four pending international applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The Company intends to file for additional patents and trademarks to continue to strengthen the Company’s intellectual property rights. Patents typically have a 20-year term from the application filing date. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect the Company’s technology or to provide the Company with a competitive advantage.
Table of Contents

The Company has also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for the Company’s products and maintain certain details about the Company’s processes, products, and strategies as trade secrets. In the U.S. and several foreign countries, the Company registers its Company name and certain of its product names as trademarks, including Cutera, AcuTip, CoolGlide, CoolGlide excel, enlighten, excel V+, LimeLight, myQ, Pearl, PICO Genesis, ProWave 770, truSculpt, truSculpt iD, truSculpt flex, Secret PRO, SecretRF, and xeo. The Company may have common law rights in other product names, including excel V, Solera, Titan and excel HR. The Company intends to file for additional trademarks to continue to strengthen the Company’s intellectual property rights.
The Company relies on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, technical consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. The Company also requires them to agree to disclose and assign to the Company all inventions conceived in connection with the relationship. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to the Company’s trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Risk Factors - Intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for some or all of the Company’s products, which may permit third parties to compete against the Company more effectively, and the Company may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact the Company’s future business and financial performance.”
Government Regulation
United States
The Company’s products are medical devices subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and counterpart agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require the Company to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of medical devices. In the U.S., FDA regulations govern the following activities that the Company performs and will continue to perform to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
•product design and development;
•product testing;
•product manufacturing;
•product safety;
•product labeling;
•product storage;
•record keeping;
•pre-market clearance or approval;
•advertising and promotion;
•production;
•product sales and distribution; and
•complaint handling.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device the Company wishes to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either prior 510(k) clearance, or de novo approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II. For Class II, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring more rigorous pre-market approval. All of the Company’s current products are Class II devices.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
When 510(k) clearance is required, the Company must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the Company’s proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of Pre-Market Approval, or "PMA", applications. 
Table of Contents

By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny 510(k), pre-market notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take significantly longer, as FDA may require additional information. Laser devices used for aesthetic procedures, such as hair removal, have generally qualified for clearance under 510(k) procedures.

Product Modifications
Pursuant to FDA regulations, after a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, labeling and biocompatibility, requires a new clearance. The FDA requires manufacturers to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. To date, the Company has modified aspects of the Company’s products after receiving regulatory clearance and determined that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. If the FDA disagrees with the Company’s determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require the Company to seek 510(k) clearance.
Clinical Trials
When FDA approval of a Class II device requires human clinical trials, only approval from the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) is required to proceed with the planned and IRB approved clinical trial/study.
The Company is required to manufacture the Company’s products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and the international quality management standard for medical systems ISO 13485:2016. The QSR and ISO 13485 cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of the Company’s products. Since 2017, the Company has been enrolled in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”). The MDSAP allows a single audit of a medical device manufacturer’s Quality Management System (“QMS”), which satisfies the requirements of five regulatory jurisdictions (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) - Australia, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) - Japan, and Agência Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitária (“ANVISA”) - Brazil); and for the EU under Europäische Norm (“EN”) International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 13485:2016 and Medical Device Directive (MDD)/EU Medical Device Regulation MDR”).
MDSAP re-certification occurs every three years with a surveillance audit taking place annually. Major findings during these audits or an increase in field reportable events could trigger regulatory enforcement action including by the FDA. The Company’s manufacturing facility is ISO 13485 certified. The Company had a successful MDSAP re-certification audit in January 2021. There were no significant findings or observations as a result of this audit. However, the Company’s failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of the Company’s manufacturing operations and the recall of the Company’s products, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. In the event that one of the Company’s suppliers fails to maintain compliance with specified quality requirements, the Company may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. The Company has opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable the Company to market the Company’s products in the U.S., the member states of the EU, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
•Quality system regulations, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses;
•Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
•Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. The Company is subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services (or “CDHS”), to determine the Company’s compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, which may include the manufacturing facilities of the Company’s subcontractors. In the past, the Company’s current manufacturing facility has been inspected by the FDA and the CDHS. The FDA and the CDHS noted observations, but there were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements. The Company’s responses to those observations have been accepted by the FDA and CDHS.
The Company is also regulated under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The regulations also require laser manufacturers to file 
Table of Contents

new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•Warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•Repair, replacement, recall or seizure of the Company’s products;
•Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•Refusing the Company’s requests for 510(k) clearance of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
•Withdrawing 510(k) clearance that have already been granted; and
•Criminal prosecution and penalties.
The FDA also has the authority to require the Company to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that it has manufactured or distributed. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
The Company is also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use and quality assurance. The Company believes that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
International
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be different than that required for FDA clearance. And the clearance or approval requirements may be different from those in the U.S.
In Japan, the Company is actively seeking approvals for products to supplement the Company’s existing approvals for enlighten, excel V, excel HR , LimeLight, ProWave, Solera, Titan, truSculpt iD and xeo.
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE mark. From January 1, 2021 the UK Conformity Assessed (UKCA) mark replaced the CE mark as the new product comfomity marking requirement in England, Wales, and Scotland. Medical devices will have until July 1, 2023 to comply. The CE mark continues to be required for goods sold in Northern Ireland. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements and allow the marketing of medical devices that meet EU requirements. The EU has adopted numerous directives and European Standardization Committees have promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA and countries which have entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. An assessment by a Notified Body in one member state of the EEA, or one country which has entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13845 certification are voluntary harmonized standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Marking. In February 2000, the Company’s facility was awarded the ISO 9001 and EN 46001 certification.
In January 2018, the Company conducted the Company’s recertification audit to the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 under the MDSAP for the five regulatory jurisdictions signatory to MDSAP (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, TGA - Australia, PMDA - Japan, and ANVISA - Brazil); and for the EU under EN ISO 13485:2016 and MDD 93/42/EEC. In January 2021, the Company passed the recertification audit re-confirming compliance with ISO13485:2016 and MDSAP. The MDSAP and EU certification can be used to demonstrate compliance with GMP/QSR/QMS requirements for all five regulatory jurisdictions, replacing routine audits from each regulatory jurisdiction. For cause audits can still occur.

Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
The Company’s worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S., if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to the Company outside the U.S., all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the sections entitled “Risk Factors – the Company’s failure to comply with rules relating to bribery, foreign corrupt practices and privacy and security laws may subject the Company to penalties and adversely impact the Company’s reputation and business operations.”

Various laws worldwide protect the confidentiality of certain patient health and other consumer information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict, enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new laws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate the Company’s clinical research and commercial activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of data. The Company will continue its efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt the Company’s business processes to those standards.
In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys new general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal court to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. The Company potentially operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that the Company receives may include protected health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of its business. While the Company has not been named in any such actions, if a substantial breach or loss of data from the Company’s records were to occur, the Company could become a target of such litigation.
In the EU, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). While many of the principles of the GDPR reflect those of the Data Protection Directive, for example in relation to the requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, there are a number of changes. In particular: (1) pro-active compliance measures are introduced, such as the requirement to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment and to appoint a Data Protection Officer where health data is processed on a “large scale;” and (2) the administrative fines that can be levied are significantly increased, the maximum being the higher of €20 million, or 4%, of the total worldwide annual turnover of the group in the previous financial year. The Company will continue its efforts to comply with the GDPR requirements and to adapt the Company’s business processes to those requirements.
Environmental Health and Safety Laws
The Company is also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, the Company’s manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of the Company’s knowledge at this time, the Company does not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
