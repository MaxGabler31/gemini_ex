Marketing and Sales

At this early stage of our operation, our officer and director is expected to handle all marketing and sales efforts. We do not have any specific marketing channels in place at this point to be able to market our services to potential customers. But, in the next twelve months, we hope to attend trade shows, advertise by word of mouth and possible reach out to local businesses to sell our products.

Referrals from current customers that were pleased with our level of product will be our most efficient form of marketing.

Competition

We know that there are a number of obstacles to entering the market of leather purses and wallets and the competition is rather high. There are several companies (Guangzhou Paparazzi Leather Co., Ltd, Evergreen leather) that offer comparative items and we will have to compete with them. We see the main competitive advantage of our competitors in the established customer base and marketing outlets. Our main advantage will be individual approach to every client. We will make our product with quality leather fabric without using leatherette. We expect to be able to compete by providing good quality products at reasonable prices.

Insurance

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.
