ITEM 1.         BUSINESS
Our Business
 
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company that discovers novel, oral, small-molecule medicines. We focus on oral treatments for rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and an enzyme plays the key role in the biological pathway of the disease. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts that are commercially available or that are in active development are summarized in the table below and are discussed in further detail under “Products and Product Candidates” in this “Part I⸻Item 1⸻Business” section of this report.

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to create stockholder value both by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists and by efficiently commercializing these drugs in the United States and certain other regions upon regulatory approval. By focusing on rare disease markets, we believe that we can more effectively control the costs of, and our strategic allocation of financial resources toward, post-approval commercialization.
 
We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. We are unique in our approach to treat orphan diseases with orally-administered, small molecules, identified by utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are:
 

● | Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad intellectual property protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to efficiently progress our product candidates through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we typically strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval or diseases where high unmet needs allow for frequent interactions with regulators. In addition, as we determine such relationships to be appropriate or desirable, we control certain fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties, including the U.S. Government. For example, our galidesivir research program is currently being developed under U.S. Government contracts. By contracting with the U.S. Government and outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk.

● | Commercializing our Product Candidates Globally. A core part of our strategy is to commercialize our rare disease products globally. We have established commercial teams in the United States and Europe for the commercialization of ORLADEYO, and we are continuing to build the structure and expertise to commercialize our products in markets where we believe we can do this efficiently and effectively. We have also established relationships with licensing and distribution partners in certain markets, including Japan, and will continue to seek such relationships where we determine this to be an effective approach.

Products and Product Candidates
 
ORLADEYO (Berotralstat)
 
ORLADEYO is an oral, once-daily therapy discovered and developed by BioCryst for the prevention of hereditary angioedema (“HAE”) attacks. HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition with a prevalence of between 1 in 33,000 to 1 in 67,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, ORLADEYO suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients.
 
ORLADEYO was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2020 for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Our specialty pharmacy provider for ORLADEYO in the U.S. began shipping ORLADEYO to patients with a prescription in the U.S. in December 2020. Through EMPOWER Patient Services, administered by our specialty pharmacy provider, we aim to streamline access to therapy by providing each HAE patient and their healthcare provider with a single point of contact for access to ORLADEYO. A dedicated care coordinator supports access for each patient with comprehensive financial support tools and reimbursement support.
 
ORLADEYO also received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) in Japan in January 2021 for prophylactic treatment of HAE in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older. ORLADEYO is the first and only prophylactic HAE medication approved in Japan. On April 14, 2021, we announced that the Japanese National Health Insurance System (“NHI”) approved the addition of ORLADEYO to the NHI drug price list on April 21, 2021. Torii, our collaborative partner commercializing ORLADEYO in Japan, launched ORLADEYO in Japan on April 23, 2021. The NHI price listing triggered a $15 million milestone payment from Torii to us. In addition, under our agreement with Torii, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20% to 40% of net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a description of our relationship with Torii. OrphanPacific, Inc., our representative partner in Japan, holds the marketing authorization for ORLADEYO in Japan.

On April 30, 2021, we announced that the European Commission (“EC”) approved ORLADEYO for routine prevention of recurrent attacks of HAE in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older. The EC approval is applicable to all European Union (“EU”) member states plus Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. ORLADEYO is the first oral, once-daily prophylactic therapy for the prevention of HAE attacks approved in Europe. On June 3, 2021, we announced the launch of ORLADEYO in Germany. Appropriate HAE patients aged 12 years and older in France currently have access to ORLADEYO through an Autorisation Temporaire d’Utilisation de cohort, or Temporary Authorization for Use, granted by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety in March 2021.  In addition, we have also launched ORLADEYO in Norway and Sweden.
 
On May 12, 2021, we announced that the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks in HAE patients 12 years and older. We announced on September 15, 2021 that the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) recommended ORLADEYO for preventing recurrent attacks of HAE in eligible patients 12 years and older if they have at least two attacks per month. With this recommendation, HAE patients in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will have access to the first oral, once-daily therapy for routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks.
 
On June 16, 2021, we announced that the Israeli Ministry of Health has accepted the regulatory submission of ORLADEYO for the prevention of recurrent attacks in patients with HAE 12 years and older and that the Israeli Ministry of Health has granted an accelerated review. In addition, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement granting Neopharm Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Israel, the exclusive rights to commercialize ORLADEYO in Israel.
 
On August 25, 2021, we announced that the new drug submission for ORLADEYO was accepted for review by Health Canada for the prevention of recurrent attacks in patients with HAE 12 years and older. We also announced that Swissmedic accepted the Company’s marketing authorization application for ORLADEYO review.
 
On September 9, 2021, we announced that the Ministry of Health and Prevention (“MOHAP”) in the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”) granted marketing authorization for ORLADEYO for the prevention of recurrent attacks in patients with HAE 12 years and older. To support commercialization efforts in the UAE, we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with NewBridge Pharmaceuticals, which also covers the Gulf Cooperation Council and Iraq.
 
On January 10, 2022, we announced that ORLADEYO is now covered by all major payors and national and regional pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S.
 
On December 7, 2020, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “2020 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with RPI 2019 Intermediate Finance Trust (“RPI”), pursuant to which we sold to RPI the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company for a purchase price of $125 million in cash. On November 19, 2021, we entered into a second Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “2021 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement” and together with the 2020 RPI Royalty Purchase Agreement, (the “RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements”) with RPI, pursuant to which we sold to RPI the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company for a purchase price of $150 million in cash. On November 19, 2021, we also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “OMERS Royalty Purchase Agreement”) and collectively with the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements, the “Royalty Purchase Agreements”) with OCM IP Healthcare Holdings Limited, an affiliate of OMERS Capital Markets (“OMERS”), pursuant to which we sold to OMERS the right to receive certain royalty payments from the Company for a purchase price of $150 million in cash. The transactions contemplated under the Royalty Purchase Agreements are referred to herein as the “Royalty Sales.” Under the Royalty Purchase Agreements, RPI and OMERS are entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales of ORLADEYO in the U.S. and certain key European markets (collectively, the “Key Territories”), and other markets where we sell ORLADEYO directly or through distributors (collectively, the “Direct Sales”). In addition, RPI and OMERS are entitled to receive a tiered revenue share on amounts generally received by us on account of ORLADEYO sublicense revenue or net sales by licensees outside of the Key Territories. See “Note 8⸻Royalty Monetizations⸻ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the Royalty Purchase Agreements.
 
We built out our U.S. commercial infrastructure in 2020 to support the launch of ORLADEYO in the U.S. in December 2020 and are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support launches in Europe and elsewhere. Based on proprietary analyses of HAE prevalence and market research studies with HAE patients, physicians, and payors in the U.S. and Europe, and our first full year of commercialization of  ORLADEYO in the U.S. in 2021, we anticipate the commercial market for ORLADEYO has the potential to reach a global peak of more than $1 billion in annual sales. We expect at least 70 to 80 percent of our revenue at peak to come from the U.S. These expectations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different. There can be no assurance that our commercialization methods and strategies will succeed, or that the market for ORLADEYO will develop in line with our current expectations. See “Risk Factors⸻Risks Relating to Our Business⸻Risks Relating to Drug Development and Commercialization⸻There can be no assurance that our commercialization efforts, methods, and strategies for our products or technologies will succeed, and our future revenue generation is uncertain” in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of these risks.

Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
The complement system is part of the body’s natural immune system and is responsible for helping the body eliminate microbes (including viral and bacterial infections) and damaged cells. It is comprised of proteins that are primarily produced in the liver and circulate in the blood. Once activated, the complement system stimulates inflammation, phagocytosis and cell lysis. Excessive or uncontrolled activation of the complement system can cause severe, and potentially fatal, immune and inflammatory disorders. The complement system comprises biological cascades of amplifying enzyme cleavages involving more than 30 proteins and protein fragments, and may be activated through three pathways: the classical pathway (initiated by antibody-antigen complexes), the lectin pathway (initiated by lectin binding) and the alternative pathway (initiated by microbial surfaces). The alternative pathway also provides a critical amplification loop for all three pathways, regardless of the initiating mechanism. Factor D is an essential enzyme in the alternative pathway, thus making Factor D an attractive target to address complement-mediated diseases. Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by dysregulation of the complement system.
 
BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D, discovered by the Company and currently in clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. Based on the safety and proof-of-concept (“PoC”) data generated to date in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), the program has advanced to pivotal studies of oral BCX9930 (500 mg twice-daily) in PNH and to a proof-of-concept trial of oral BCX9930 (500 mg twice-daily) in three renal complement-mediated diseases, C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), IgA nephropathy (IgAN), and primary membranous nephropathy (PMN). We are working closely with regulators and key opinion leaders in hematology and nephrology to map the advanced development strategy across a broad set of indications. Our goal is to develop oral BCX9930 as a monotherapy for complement-mediated diseases.
 
We have completed a proof-of-concept trial in patients with PNH, including both treatment-naïve and those patients with an inadequate response to C5 inhibitors.  Patients on BCX9930 have been allowed to roll over with continued follow-up into a long-term safety trial.  We continue to monitor the patients who continue in the long-term safety trial.
 
On November 29, 2021, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the REDEEM-2 pivotal trial with BCX9930 in patients with PNH. REDEEM-2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of BCX9930 (500 mg twice-daily) as monotherapy versus placebo in PNH patients not currently receiving complement inhibitor therapy. In part 1 of this trial, patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive BCX9930 or placebo under double-blind conditions for 12 weeks. All patients will receive BCX9930 in part 2 (weeks 13-52) to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of BCX9930, with patients randomized to placebo in part 1 switching to BCX9930 at the week 12 visit. The primary endpoint of REDEEM-2 is change from baseline in hemoglobin, as assessed at week 12.
 
On January 7, 2022, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the REDEEM-1 pivotal trial with BCX9930 in patients with PNH. REDEEM-1 is a randomized, open-label, active comparator-controlled comparison of the efficacy and safety of BCX9930 (500 mg twice-daily) monotherapy in PNH patients with an inadequate response to a C5 inhibitor. In part 1 of this trial, patients who have not had an adequate response to a C5 inhibitor will be randomized 2:1 to discontinue their C5 inhibitor and receive BCX9930 as monotherapy or to continue receiving their C5 inhibitor for 24 weeks. All patients will receive BCX9930 in part 2 (weeks 25-52) to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of BCX9930. Patients who are randomized to C5 inhibitor therapy in part 1 will discontinue that therapy at the week 24 visit and start BCX9930 for part 2. The primary endpoint of REDEEM-1 is change from baseline in hemoglobin, as assessed at weeks 12 to 24.
 
On February 22, 2022, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in the RENEW proof-of-concept basket study with BCX9930 in patients with C3 glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, and primary membranous nephropathy.  RENEW is an open-label, multicenter, proof-of-concept study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and therapeutic potential of BCX9930 (twice-daily) administered for 24 weeks in patients with either C3G, IgAN, or PMN.  All patients will be enrolled into one of three parallel study cohorts, based on confirmation of diagnosis and disease activity in a recent kidney biopsy, and will receive BCX9930 for the 24-week treatment period.  The primary endpoint of RENEW is percent change from baseline in 24-hour urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR), as assessed at week 24.
 
BCX9930 has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations from the FDA for the treatment of PNH. Orphan drug designation qualifies BCX9930 for various development incentives, including tax credits for certain clinical costs, a waiver of the new drug application fee, and a designated period of market exclusivity following approval. According to the FDA, the purpose of the Fast Track designation is to get important new drugs to patients earlier by facilitating the development, and expediting the review, of drugs to treat serious conditions and meet an unmet medical need.
 
Under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements, RPI will be entitled to receive tiered, sales-based royalties on net product sales, if any, of BCX9930 and another earlier stage Factor D inhibitor, as well has tiered, profit share amounts of up to 3.0% from certain other permitted sales in certain markets. See “Note 8⸻Royalty Monetizations⸻ORLADEYO and Factor D Inhibitors” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about our obligations under the RPI Royalty Purchase Agreements.

Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (“FOP”)
 
FOP is an ultra-rare disease that affects approximately 1 in 2 million people worldwide. It is a severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (“HO”). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. In patients with FOP, minor trauma can result in rapid development of painful inflammatory masses. These progress over several weeks resulting in the replacement of the affected soft tissue by permanent bone masses. There is no cure for this condition, and there are no approved treatments for FOP in the U.S.
 
In 2018, we announced the advancement of a program exploring activin receptor-like kinase-2 (“ALK2”) inhibitors for treatment of FOP. ALK2 enzyme is a part of the normal signaling pathway for bone formation and responds to binding its specific ligands (bone morphogenic proteins, or BMPs), by stimulating normal bone growth and renewal in healthy children and adults. Specific activating mutations of the ALK2 gene are seen in all cases of FOP. An activating mutation in ALK2 is necessary for the disease to occur, making the ALK2 kinase an ideal drug target for treatment of FOP with an ALK2 kinase inhibitor.
 
The goal of our ALK2 inhibitor program is to discover and develop orally administered kinase inhibitor drug candidates that are able to slow or prevent HO. In a phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, our lead compound, BCX9250, was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.
 
Peramivir Injection (RAPIVAB, RAPIACTA, PERAMIFLU)
 
RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) was developed under a $234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“BARDA/HHS”). In January 2010, our partner, Shionogi, received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It is approved in Japan for the treatment of adults, children, and infants with uncomplicated seasonal influenza and those patients at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In August 2010, our partner, Green Cross, received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food & Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A & B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. See “Collaborations and In-License Relationships” below for a discussion of these licensing arrangements.
 
Peramivir was also approved in the United States in 2014, Taiwan in 2016, Canada in 2017, and Australia in 2018. A Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) was approved in the United States in February 2021, extending RAPIVAB’s availability for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza to pediatric patients six months and older. Prior to this approval, peramivir had been indicated in the United States for pediatric patients two years and older. In the United States, peramivir is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients who have been symptomatic for no more than two days.
 
In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period to supply the Strategic National Stockpile for use in a public health emergency. We delivered 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract in 2019 for a total price of approximately $13.9 million. We delivered another 9,980 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract in 2021 for a total price of approximately $6.9 million. On September 1, 2021, we announced that HHS exercised its option to purchase an additional 10,000 doses of RAPIVAB under this contract for a total price of approximately $6.9 million. As a result, we expect to deliver at least one shipment of 10,000 doses within the contract in 2022.
 
Galidesivir (BCX4430)
 
Galidesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral (“BSAV”) that has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Marburg, Yellow Fever, Ebola, and Zika viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack.
 
The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The primary focus of the program is treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses. Our galidesivir research program is currently being developed under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the HHS (“NIAID/HHS”) and BARDA/HHS.
 
NIAID/HHS funding has supported galidesivir’s development as a treatment for Marburg virus, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus. Since September 2013, NIAID/HHS has supported the development of galidesivir as a therapeutic for Ebola and Marburg viruses. As of the date hereof, all options under our initial contract with NIAID/HHS have been awarded. The total amount under the initial contract, as amended, is $47.3 million, inclusive of the $1.4 million added to the contract in September 2021 to pay for certain additional costs, including additional manufacturing development costs and overhead. This is the commencement of the closing out of the initial contract.
 
    8 

  

The contract we entered into with NIAID/HHS in August 2020 for the manufacture and evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of galidesivir, with potential aggregate funding of up to $43.9 million if all contract options are exercised, remains ongoing. NIAID/HHS made an initial award of $6.3 million under this contract in 2020.
 
Since March 2015, BARDA/HHS has supported the development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for filoviruses. The total BARDA/HHS contract value to advance the program through toxicology studies and manufacturing work to support a new drug application is $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of the date hereof, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.
 
Collaborations and In-License Relationships
 
Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Torii”)
 
On November 5, 2019, we entered into a Commercialization and License Agreement with Torii (the “Torii Agreement”), granting Torii the exclusive right to commercialize ORLADEYO for the prevention of HAE attacks in Japan. Under the Torii Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $22.0 million. We received an additional milestone payment of $15.0 million in the second quarter of 2021 upon receipt from the NHI of a reimbursement price approval for ORLADEYO.
 
Under the Torii Agreement, we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 20% to 40% of annual net sales of ORLADEYO in Japan during each calendar year. Torii’s royalty payment obligations are subject to customary reductions in certain circumstances, but may not be reduced by more than 50% of the amount that otherwise would have been payable to us in the applicable calendar quarter. Torii’s royalty payment obligations commenced upon the first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan and expire upon the later of (i) the tenth anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of ORLADEYO in Japan, (ii) the expiration of our patents covering ORLADEYO, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for ORLADEYO in Japan. We are responsible for supplying Torii with its required amounts of ORLADEYO. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Torii Agreement are overseen by a joint steering committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from each party to coordinate the development and commercialization of ORLADEYO in Japan.
 
Under the Torii Agreement, we granted Torii a right of first negotiation (“ROFN”) to commercialize ORLADEYO in Japan for the acute treatment of HAE attacks if we develop ORLADEYO for such indication and to commercialize any additional kallikrein inhibitor that we may develop in the future for use in HAE in Japan. Under both ROFNs, if the parties do not agree to terms with respect to a definitive amendment to the Torii Agreement or new agreement, as applicable, the terms of the amendment or agreement would be set by a third-party arbitrator.
 
Shionogi & Co., Ltd. (“Shionogi”)
 
In February 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Shionogi Agreement”), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. Under the terms of the Shionogi Agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14.0 million upfront payment. The license provided for development milestone payments (up to $21.0 million), which have all been paid, and for commercial milestone payments (up to $95.0 million) in addition to double-digit (between 10% and 20%) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir, in accordance with the terms of the Shionogi Agreement.
 
In December 2017, we, on behalf of JPR Royalty Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioCryst (“Royalty Sub”), instituted arbitration proceedings against Shionogi in order to resolve a dispute with Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement regarding the achievement of sales milestones and escalating royalties. The arbitration proceedings concluded with the decision that no sales milestones had been achieved and that royalties would remain the same. The costs associated with the arbitration proceedings are recoverable from the assets of Royalty Sub in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and servicing agreement relating to the PhaRMA Notes (each as defined below under “Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable”).
 
Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate the Shionogi Agreement in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham (“UAB”) and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi.

On March 9, 2011, we completed a $30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement. Pursuant to the transaction, Royalty Sub issued $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0% Notes due 2020 (the “PhaRMA Notes”) in a private placement to institutional investors. The PhaRMA Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the “Indenture”), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We received net proceeds of $22.7 million from this transaction.
 
As part of the transaction, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement, dated as of March 9, 2011, with Royalty Sub, whereby we transferred to Royalty Sub, among other things, (i) our rights to receive commercial royalty and milestone payments from Shionogi under the Shionogi Agreement and (ii) the right to receive payments under a Japanese yen/US dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement, which was put into place by us in connection with the transaction and expired in November 2020. Royalty payments are paid by Shionogi in Japanese yen, and milestone payments are paid in U.S. dollars. Our collaboration with Shionogi was not impacted by this transaction.
 
Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are payable from, and are secured by the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, which were transferred by us to Royalty Sub. The PhaRMA Notes bear interest at 14.0% per annum, payable annually in arrears on September 1st of each year (the “Payment Date”). We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes.
 
Royalty Sub’s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of our equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. We may, but are not obligated to, make capital contributions to a capital account that may be used to redeem, or on up to one occasion pay any interest shortfall on, the PhaRMA Notes.
 
In September 2014, Royalty Sub was unable to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding payment date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014. This inability constituted an event of default under the terms of the Indenture. Accordingly, we classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet since that time. The PhaRMA Notes matured on December 1, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes of $30.0 million, together with all accrued and unpaid interest of $20.6 million, was due in full. The failure by Royalty Sub to repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the PhaRMA Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, at the December 1, 2020 final maturity date, constituted an additional event of default under the PhaRMA Notes. As a result of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and our equity interests in Royalty Sub, and they may exercise other remedies available to them under the Indenture in respect of the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments, if any, that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we might otherwise be adversely affected. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential foreclosure, we believe the primary impact to us would be the loss of future royalty payments, if any, from Shionogi and the legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. As a result, we do not currently expect the continuing events of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that we will not otherwise be adversely affected as a result of the continuing events of default under the PhaRMA Notes.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the PhaRMA Notes remained in default. We wrote off the balance due under the PhaRMA Notes to other income as a debt extinguishment as of December 31, 2021. See “Note 8−Royalty Monetizations−RAPIACTA−Non-Recourse Notes Payable−Debt Extinguishment” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the write-off.
 
The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. The Indenture includes customary representations and warranties of Royalty Sub, affirmative and negative covenants of Royalty Sub, events of default and related remedies, and provisions regarding the duties of the Trustee, indemnification of the Trustee, and other matters typical for indentures used in structured financings of this type.
 
Green Cross Corporation (“Green Cross”)
 
In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea and we are entitled to share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products, and other information would be transferred to us.
 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Industrial Research, Ltd. (“AECOM” and “IRL,” respectively)
 
In June 2000, we licensed a series of potent inhibitors of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (“PNP”) from AECOM and IRL (together, the “Licensors”). The lead product candidate from this collaboration is forodesine. We have obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute it, or any other, product candidates that might arise from research on these inhibitors. We have the option to expand our license agreement with the Licensors to include other inventions in the field made by the investigators or employees of the Licensors. Under this agreement, as amended and restated, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop these drugs and to pay certain milestone payments for each licensed product (which range in the aggregate from $1.4 million to almost $4.0 million per indication) for future development, single digit royalties on net sales of any resulting product made by us, and to share a portion of future payments received from other third-party partners, if any. In addition, we have agreed to pay annual license fees, which can range from $150,000 to $500,000, that are creditable against actual royalties and other payments due to the Licensors. The Licensors have also granted us an exclusive worldwide license of galidesivir for any antiviral use.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) 
 
We currently have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. Under the terms of these agreements, UAB performed specific research for us in return for research payments and license fees. UAB has granted us certain rights to any discoveries in these areas resulting from research developed by UAB or jointly developed with us. We have agreed to pay single digit royalties on sales of any resulting product and to share in future payments received from other third-party partners. We have completed the research under the UAB agreements. These two agreements have initial 25-year terms, are automatically renewable for five-year terms throughout the life of the last patent and are terminable by us upon three months’ notice and by UAB under certain circumstances. Upon termination, both parties shall cease using the other parties’ proprietary and confidential information and materials, the parties shall jointly own joint inventions, and UAB shall resume full ownership of all UAB licensed products. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts received.
 
Government Contracts
 
RAPIVAB (Peramivir Injection)
 
In September 2018, HHS awarded us a $34.7 million contract for the procurement of up to 50,000 doses of RAPIVAB over a five-year period, including an initial base order of 10,000 doses. In each of September 2019, 2020, and 2021, HHS exercised its options to purchase an additional 10,000 doses of RAPIVAB. We delivered a total of 20,000 doses of RAPIVAB and recorded approximately $13.9 million of product sales in 2019. In 2021, we delivered another shipment of 9,980 doses within the contract, totaling approximately $6.9 million in product sales. We expect to deliver at least one shipment of 10,000 doses within the contract in 2022, totaling approximately $6.9 million in product sales. The RAPIVAB purchases by HHS will supply the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s largest supply of life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for use in a public health emergency.
Galidesivir
 
In March 2015, BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of galidesivir as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract has a potential value of $39.1 million if all contract options are exercised. As of the date of this report, a total of $20.6 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.
 
In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of galidesivir as a treatment for Marburg, and subsequently, Yellow Fever and Ebola virus disease. All options under this contract have been awarded, and the total value of the contract, as amended, is $47.3 million, inclusive of the $1.4 million added to the contract in September 2021 to pay for certain additional costs, including additional manufacturing development costs and overhead. This contract is in the process of being closed out.
 
In August 2020, NIAID/HHS awarded us a new $43.9 million contract for the manufacture and evaluation of the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of galidesivir. NIAID/HHS made an initial award of $6.3 million under this new contract.
 
The contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of peramivir and galidesivir plus a fixed fee, or profit. BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are also terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.
 
Patents and Proprietary Information
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes, and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology, and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology, and products and product candidates.
 
    11 

  

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we have been issued approximately 28 U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2039 and that relate to our kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP inhibitor compounds, and complement-mediated disease program compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, totaling three additional U.S. patents that expire between 2023 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 25 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to kallikrein inhibitor compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV compounds, PNP inhibitor compounds, FOP program compounds, and complement-mediated disease program compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories.
 
Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries, and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive commercial and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, many have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials, and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations who conduct research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals, and commence commercial marketing and sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage.
 
In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.
 
HAE
 
HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 33,000 to 67,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor (“C1-INH”), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40% primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are several licensed therapies for HAE, including the following:
 
    12 

  


● | C1-INH replacement therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert®) and as a prophylactic therapy (Haegarda® and Cinryze®). These therapies are dosed subcutaneously and intravenously. Recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest®) is also available as an acute therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Kallikrein Inhibitors ⸻ Kalbitor® (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is dosed subcutaneously by healthcare providers to treat acute HAE attacks. Takhzyro® (lanadelumab-flyo) is a monoclonal antibody approved for prophylaxis of HAE attacks and can be self-administered as a subcutaneous injection.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bradykinin receptor antagonist ⸻ Firazyr® (icatibant) and generic icatibant are indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other medications ⸻ Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in liver damage, virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended for patients on chronic androgen therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are aware of a number of HAE therapies in clinical development that, if approved, may compete with ORLADEYO. These include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase | Role in Therapy 
----------+--------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------------+----------------------
KalVista | KVD-900 | Kallikrein inhibitor | Oral | III | Acute treatment

CSL | Garadacimab | Anti-factor XII mAb | IV/Subcutaneous | III | Prophylaxis 
Ionis | Donidalorsen | Antisense inhibitor of prekallikrein | Subcutaneous | III | Prophylaxis 

 
Complement-Mediated Diseases
 
Several rare diseases are known to be mediated by defects of the complement system, including PNH, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (“aHUS”), complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”), and myasthenia gravis. Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease’s Soliris® (eculizumab) is a C5 inhibitor approved for PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Soliris had global sales of over $1.9 billion in 2021. Alexion also received FDA approval for Ultomiris® (ravulizumab), a longer-acting C5 inhibitor, as a treatment for PNH in late 2018 and aHUS in late 2019. Global sales for Ultomiris were $688 million in 2021. Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Empaveli® is a C3 inhibitor approved for PNH in the U.S. and Europe in 2021.
 
In addition to BCX9930, we are aware of a number of complement pathway-based products in development, which include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase
-------------+-----------------------+---------------------+-------------------------+------------
Apellis | Empaveli | C3 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | Approved 
Akari | Nomacopan | C5 Inhibitor | Subcutaneous | III

FOP
 
FOP is a rare, severely disabling condition characterized by HO. HO can occur in muscles, tendons, and soft tissue. FOP patients progressively become bound by this irregular ossification, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP in the U.S.
 
In addition to BCX9250, we are aware of a number of FOP therapies in clinical development, which include:
 

Company | Asset | Mechanism of Action | Route of Administration | Trial Phase
----------+--------------+--------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------------
Ipsen | Palovarotene | Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Gamma Agonist | Oral | NDA 
 | IPN60130 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | II 
Regeneron | Garetosmab | Anti-activin A | IV | III 
Incyte | INCB00928 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | II 
Keros | KER-047 | ALK-2 Inhibitor | Oral | I/II 

Antivirals
 
The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements, and reimbursement. A number of products are currently available in the U.S. and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.’s (“Roche”) TAMIFLU® (oseltamivir), generic oseltamivir, GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (“GSK”) RELENZA®, Genentech and Shiongi’s XOFLUZA® and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.’s INAVIR®. In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation’s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan.
 
Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants, and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors.
 
Galidesivir is a product candidate in our BSAV research program and is currently being developed under contracts with NIAID/HHS and BARDA/HHS. The objective of our BSAV program is to develop galidesivir as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The U.S. Government is investing in a number of programs intended to address gaps in its medical countermeasure plan.
 
Research and Development
 
We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies, including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry, and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early-stage clinical trials.
Compliance
 
We conduct our business in an ethical, fair, honest, and lawful manner. We act responsibly, respectfully, and with integrity in our relationships with patients, health care professionals, collaborators, governments, regulatory entities, stockholders, suppliers, and vendors.
 
In order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief People Officer oversee compliance training, education, auditing, and monitoring; enforce disciplinary guidelines for any infractions of our corporate polices; implement new policies and procedures; respond to any detected issues; and undertake corrective action procedures. Our controls address compliance with laws and regulations that govern public pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, the following: federal and state law, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; Nasdaq listing requirements; the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the SEC, the FDA, and HHS; and applicable laws and regulations administered by foreign regulatory authorities, including those of the EU, the U.K., and Japan. Our standard operating procedures are designed to provide a framework for corporate governance in accordance with ethical standards and best legal practices.
 
Government Regulation
 
The FDA regulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., and our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulations prior to commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations are a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including:
 
    14 

  


● | delays;
--+--------


● | warning letters;
--+-----------------


● | fines;
--+-------


● | product recalls or seizures;
--+-----------------------------


● | injunctions;
--+-------------


● | penalties;
--+-----------


● | refusal of the FDA to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | total or partial suspension of production;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | civil penalties;
--+-----------------


● | withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecutions.
--+-----------------------

 
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred, and significant time may be devoted to clinical development.
 
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or approval of new indications for our existing products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
 
FDA Regulation
 
Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an investigation new drug application (“IND”), including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial.
 
Clinical trials to support a new drug application (“NDA”) are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.
 
Phase 1 — During phase 1, which involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses.
 
Phase 2 — Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 
Phase 3 (pivotal) — If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies, or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials be conducted.
 
Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors, including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in the study depends on:
 

● | willingness of investigators to participate in a study;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the willingness of patients to participate; and
--+------------------------------------------------


● | the patients meeting the eligibility criteria.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines.
 
After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application “filed” at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 6 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 10 months. The FDA may refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regard to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee.
 
    15 

  

Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an “action letter” on the application. The action letter will either be an “approval letter,” in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a “complete response letter.” A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA’s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two- or six-month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the NDA. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.
 
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the U.S. pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation, if sought, must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant with FDA orphan drug designation for a particular active ingredient to receive FDA approval of the designated drug for the disease indication for which it has such designation, is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period (“Orphan drug exclusivity”) in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not finally approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with Orphan drug exclusivity or if the license holder cannot supply sufficient quantities of the product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition, provided that the sponsor has conducted appropriate clinical trials required for approval. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee for the orphan indication.
Fast Track Designation
 
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of an IND may request the FDA to designate the drug candidate as a Fast Track drug if it is intended to treat a serious condition and fulfill an unmet medical need. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Once the FDA designates a drug as a Fast Track candidate, it is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of that drug by providing more frequent communication with, and guidance to, the sponsor.
 
In addition to other benefits, such as greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track drug's NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's review period as specified under PDUFA V for filing and reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA has been submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval, commercial sales, and distribution of drugs. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above, as well as additional country-specific regulations. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
 
The various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union (the “EU”) are subject to significant regulatory controls. Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended (the “Clinical Trials Directive”), a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the national competent authority of each EU member state in which a clinical trial is planned to be conducted. A clinical trial application (“CTA”) is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents, including but not limited to the clinical trial protocol. Further, a clinical trial may only be started after an independent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the CTA in that country.
 
In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Regulation”), which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The Regulation came into effect in January 2022 with a three-year transition period in which clinical trial sponsors will be able to choose among different submission pathways. The Regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU member states, aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 
Manufacturing and import into the EU of investigational medicinal products for use in clinical trials is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMP.
 
Under EU regulatory systems, we may submit marketing authorizations either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), which then makes a recommendation to the European Commission (“EC”). The EC makes the final determination on whether to approve the application.  The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions, and the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states.
 
The United Kingdom’s (“U.K.”) exit from the EU, or Brexit, has caused political and economic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates, and this uncertainty may persist for years.  From January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the U.K.’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together, Great Britain or “GB”). Northern Ireland continues to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority remains the MHRA. The MHRA has published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the U.K. The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the EU.
 
Under the Japanese regulatory system administered by the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”), pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval, we must submit an application for approval to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (“MHLW”) with results of nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy, and safety of a new drug. A data compliance review, good Clinical Practices, or GCP, on-site inspection, cGMP audit, and detailed data review are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council (“PAFSC”). Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by the MHLW. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. The price will be determined within 60 to 90 days following approval unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The government generally introduces price cut rounds every other year and also mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. The Japanese government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.

Fraud and Abuse and Related Regulatory Laws
 
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including both federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. Outside of the U.S., we may be subject to analogous foreign laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations apply to our or our partners’ operations, sales and marketing practices, price reporting, and relationships with physicians and other customers and third-party payors. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursement or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
 
In addition, we are subject to the federal physician sunshine act and certain similar physician payment and drug pricing transparency legislation in various states. The sunshine provisions apply to manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government certain payments made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Violations of the physician sunshine act and similar legislation or the fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and future exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.
 
Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
 
In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products.
 
Adequate coverage and reimbursement in the U.S. and other markets is critical to the commercial success of approved products. Recently in the U.S., there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the U.S. have been increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Many third-party payors negotiate the price of medical services and products and develop formularies that establish pricing and reimbursement levels. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the third-party payor’s patient population. The process for obtaining coverage can be lengthy and costly, and it could take several months before a particular payor initially reviews a product and makes a decision with respect to coverage. For example, third-party payors may require cost-benefit analysis data in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of a particular product.
 
Outside the U.S., ensuring adequate coverage and payment for drug products can have challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct an active comparator clinical trial to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates or products to other available therapies to support our pricing, which could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved healthcare products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, including reference price grouping, price freezes, increased price cuts, and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) made extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the U.S. The PPACA included numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies, some of which became effective immediately and others of which have taken effect over the past several years. For example, the PPACA expanded healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of Medicaid. The PPACA also imposed substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers, such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to Medicaid, new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the Medicare prescription drug benefit, an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the U.S., and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics. The PPACA also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally, including pharmaceuticals. It also required reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals.
 
The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are also required to report and disclose certain payments and transfers of value to, and investment interests held by, physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Compliance with the PPACA and state laws with similar provisions is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.
 
In addition, there have been a number of other legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the pharmaceutical industry. For example, legislation has been enacted in certain states and at a federal level that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. Compliance with these electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 
Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to U.S. federal and state health information privacy, security, and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect to protected health information (“PHI”), than the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, which are collectively referred to as HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA or that enter into a resolution agreement with the HHS to settle actual or potential allegations of HIPAA noncompliance may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations.
 
Many state laws govern the privacy of personal information in specified circumstances. For example, in California the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the CCPA, other personal information may be covered, and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
 
EU member states, the U.K., Switzerland, and other jurisdictions have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations, and guidelines of the states in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze, and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, the U.K., or Switzerland, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data, and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the EEA, the U.K., or Switzerland. Guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
