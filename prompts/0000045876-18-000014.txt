North America | 27 | % | | 26 | %
Latin America (a) | 16 | % | | 14 | %
Asia-Pacific | 13 | % | | 12 | %
Middle East and Africa | 4 | % | | 5 | %
Eastern Europe | 3 | % | | 3 | %


(a) | Including Mexico.

For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 63%, 67% and 64%, respectively.
Harsco Industrial Segment—19% of consolidated revenues for 2017
The Harsco Industrial Segment includes the Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers, Harsco Industrial IKG and Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley businesses. Approximately 91% of this Segment's revenues originate in North America.
Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers is a leading supplier of custom-engineered and manufactured air-cooled heat exchangers for the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries in the U.S. Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers' heat exchangers are the primary apparatus used to condition natural gas during recovery, compression and transportation from underground reserves through the major pipeline distribution channels. 
Harsco Industrial IKG manufactures a varied line of industrial grating products at several plants in the U.S. and an international plant located in Mexico.  These products include a full range of metal bar grating configurations, which are used mainly in industrial flooring, as well as safety and security applications in the energy, paper, chemical, refining and processing industries.
Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley is a leading manufacturer of energy-efficient heat transfer products such as boilers and water heaters for commercial and institutional applications.
For 2017, 2016 and 2015, this Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 19%, 17% and 21%, respectively.
2

Harsco Rail Segment—18% of consolidated revenues for 2017
The Harsco Rail Segment is a global provider of equipment, after-market parts and services for the maintenance, repair and construction of railway track. The Segment's equipment and services support private and government-owned railroads and urban transit systems worldwide. In March 2015, the Company acquired Protran Technology ("Protran"), a U.S. designer and producer of safety systems for transportation and industrial applications; and in April 2015, the Company acquired JK Rail Products, LLC ("JK Rail"), a provider of after-market parts for railroad track maintenance.
The Harsco Rail Segment's products are produced in three countries and products and services are provided worldwide. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, export product sales from the U.S. for the Harsco Rail Segment were $82.7 million, $67.9 million and $67.1 million, respectively. 
For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Harsco Rail Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 18%, 16% and 15%, respectively.
(1)(i)  The products and services of the Company are generated through a number of product groups. These product groups are more fully discussed in Note 15, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The product groups that contributed 10% or more as a percentage of consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years are set forth in the following table:

 | Percentage of Consolidated Revenues
Product Group | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Outsourced, on-site services of material logistics, product quality improvement and resource recovery for iron, steel and metals manufacturing; as well as value added environmental solutions for industrial co-products | 63 | % | | 67 | % | 64 | %
Railway track maintenance services and equipment | 18 | % | | 16 | % | 15 | %
Air-cooled heat exchangers | 9 | % | | 6 | % | 11 | %

(1)(ii)  New products and services are added from time to time; however, in 2017, 2016 and 2015 none required the investment of a material amount of the Company's assets.
(1)(iii)  The manufacturing requirements of the Company's operations are such that no unusual sources of supply for raw materials are required. The raw materials used by the Company for its product manufacturing principally include steel and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, which are usually readily available. The profitability of the Company's manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of steel and other materials and commodities.
(1)(iv)  While the Company has a number of trademarks, patents and patent applications, it does not consider that any material part of its business is dependent upon them.
(1)(v)  The Company's Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment provides services which are usually subject to volume reductions at certain points of the year and the Company furnishes products within the Harsco Industrial Segment that are seasonal in nature. As a result, the Company's revenues and results of operations for the first quarter ending March 31 and the fourth quarter ending December 31 may be lower than the second quarter ending June 30 and the third quarter ending September 30. Additionally, the Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of the year. This is a result of normally higher income during the second half of the year.
(1)(vi)  The practices of the Company relating to working capital are similar to those of other industrial service providers or manufacturers servicing both domestic and international industrial customers and commercial markets. These practices include the following:

• | Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 to 60 days, with progress or advance payments required for certain long-lead-time or large orders. Payment terms are slightly longer in certain international markets. 


• | Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 to 90 days.


• | Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand. Due to the time required to manufacture certain railway track maintenance equipment to customer specifications, inventory levels of this business tend to increase for an extended period of time during the production phase and decline when the equipment is sold.

(1)(vii)  In 2017 and 2016, the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment had one customer and in 2015 had two customers that each provided in excess of 10% of this Segment's revenues under multiple long-term contracts at several mill sites. The loss of any one of the contracts would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position or cash flows; however, it could have a significant effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. Additionally, a decline in economic conditions may further impact the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis and could result in bankruptcy or receivership filings by any of such customers. If customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, or if the Company is unable to collect amounts due from customers for any reason, it could adversely impact the realizability of receivables and inventories, and the recoverability of long-lived assets across the Company's businesses. As part of its credit risk management practices, the Company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base. 
The Harsco Industrial Segment had one customer in 2017, no customers in 2016 and two customers in 2015 that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. 
The Harsco Rail Segment had one customer in 2017 and 2016 and two customers in 2015 that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. 
(1)(viii)  At December 31, 2017, the Company's metals services contracts had estimated future revenues of $2.8 billion at expected production levels, compared with $2.7 billion at December 31, 2016. This provides the Company with a substantial base of long-term revenues. The increase is primarily due to the timing of contract expirations, new and renewed contracts, and foreign currency translation. Approximately 25% of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2018; approximately 40% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021; approximately 13% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2024; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. There are no significant metals services contracts for which the estimated costs to complete the contract currently exceed the estimated revenue to be realized included in the estimated future revenues. The estimated future revenues are exclusive of anticipated contract renewals, projected volume increases and ad-hoc services. 
At December 31, 2017, the Company had an estimated order backlog of $85.3 million in the Harsco Industrial Segment, compared with $54.4 million at December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to fundamental market improvement for the segment's air-cooled heat exchangers businesses for customers primarily in the upstream compression and gas processing markets due to improved oil prices, ultimately driving higher capital spending. There is also moderate growth in the segment's industrial and commercial boilers and hot water heater group. In addition, at December 31, 2017, the Harsco Rail Segment had an estimated order backlog of $260.5 million, compared with $273.0 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily due to shipments, including those to the federal railway system of Switzerland, which were not replaced due to decreased demand, primarily in the U.S., during 2017. At December 31, 2017, $155.5 million or 45% of the Company's manufactured products order backlog is not expected to be filled in 2018. The remainder of this backlog is expected to be filled in 2019 and 2020. The order backlog is exclusive of long-term metals industry services contracts, roofing granules and industrial abrasives products, and minerals and metal recovery technologies services.
(1)(ix)  At December 31, 2017, the Company had no material contracts that were subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the U.S. Government.
(1)(x)  The Company's competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of services and products provided and the global breadth and depth of markets served. No single service provider or manufacturer competes with the Company with respect to all services provided or products manufactured and sold. In general, on a global basis, the Company's segments are among the market leaders in their respective sectors and compete with a range of global, regional and local businesses of varying size and scope.
Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment—This Segment provides outsourced on-site services to the global metals industries in approximately 30 countries, with the largest operations focused in the U.S., the U.K., France, China and Brazil. This Segment is one of the world's largest providers of these services. This Segment's key competitive factors are innovative resource recovery solutions, significant industry experience, technology, safety performance, service and value. This Segment competes principally with a number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers. Additionally, due to the nature of this Segment's services, it encounters a certain degree of "competition" from customers' desire to perform similar services themselves instead of using an outsourced solution.

Harsco Industrial Segment—This Segment includes manufacturing businesses located principally in the U.S. Key competitive factors include quality, value, technology and energy-efficiency. Primary competitors are U.S.-based manufacturers of similar products. 
Harsco Rail Segment—This Segment manufactures and sells highly-engineered railway track maintenance equipment and collision avoidance and warning systems to support passenger, rail worker and pedestrian safety, produced primarily in the U.S. for customers throughout the world. Additionally, this Segment provides railway track maintenance services principally in the U.S. and the U.K. This Segment's key competitive factors are quality, technology, customer service and value. Primary competitors for both products and services are privately-held global businesses as well as certain regional competitors. In March 2015, the Company acquired Protran, a U.S. designer and producer of safety systems for transportation and industrial applications; and in April 2015, the Company acquired JK Rail, a provider of after-market parts for railroad track maintenance. 
(1)(xi)  The Company's expense for research and development activities was $4.2 million, $4.3 million and $4.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This excludes technology development and engineering costs classified in cost of services and products sold or selling, general and administrative expense. For additional information regarding research and development activities, see Research and Development, in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
(1)(xii)  The Company has become subject to, as have others, stringent air and water quality control legislation. In general, the Company has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with these environmental regulations and does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. While the Company expects that environmental regulations may expand, and that expenditures for air and water quality control will continue, the Company cannot predict the effect on its business of such expanded regulations. For additional information regarding environmental matters see Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
(1)(xiii)  At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 9,400 employees.
