Forward Looking Statements
 This annual report contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements concerning plans, objectives, future events or performance and assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact.  Forward-looking statements may be identified by reference to a future period or periods or by use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “pursue,” “views” and similar terms or expressions.  Various statements contained in Item 7- “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” including, but not limited to, statements related to management's views on the banking environment and the economy, competition and market expansion opportunities, the interest rate environment, credit risk and the level of future non-performing assets and charge-offs, potential asset and deposit growth, future non-interest expenditures and non-interest income growth, and borrowing capacity are forward-looking statements.  HV Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company" or "HV Bancorp") wishes to caution readers that such forward-looking statements reflect numerous assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect the Company's future results.  The following important factors, among others, could cause the Company's results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made herein: (i) changes in interest rates and changes in the duration of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities could negatively impact net interest income;  (ii) changes in the business cycle and downturns in the local, regional or national economies, including deterioration in the local real estate market, could negatively impact credit and/or asset quality and result in credit losses and increases in the Company's allowance for loan losses and/or reduce valuations of foreclosed properties and real estate held for sale; (iii) changes in consumer spending could negatively impact the Company's credit quality and financial results; (iv) increasing competition from larger regional and out-of-state banking organizations as well as non-bank providers of various financial services could adversely affect the Company's competitive position within its market area and reduce demand for the Company's products and services; (v) deterioration of securities markets could adversely affect the value or credit quality of the Company's assets and the availability of funding sources necessary to meet the Company's liquidity needs; (vi) changes in technology could adversely impact the Company's operations and increase technology-related expenditures; (vii) increases in employee compensation and benefit expenses could adversely affect the Company's financial results; (viii) changes in laws and regulations that apply to the Company's business and operations, including without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act") and the additional regulations that will be forthcoming as a result thereof, could adversely affect the Company's business environment, operations and financial results; (ix) changes in accounting standards, policies and practices, as may be adopted or established by the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) could negatively impact the Company's financial results; (x) our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; and (xi) future regulatory compliance costs, including any increase caused by new regulations imposed by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.  Therefore, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking information and statements.

 Huntingdon Valley Bank
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a stock savings bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the "Pennsylvania Department of Banking"). We have offices in Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware. We are a community-oriented bank offering a variety of financial products and services to meet the needs of our customers. We believe that our community orientation and personalized service distinguishes us from larger banks that operate in our market area. 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank was founded in 1871 as a building and loan association.  In 1951, the association converted to a federal thrift charter, changed its name to “Huntingdon Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association” and became federally insured. In January 2000, we changed our corporate name to “Huntingdon Valley Bank.” On July 1, 2003, Huntingdon Valley Bank converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a Pennsylvania chartered mutual savings bank. 
 Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, primarily in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”) and commercial real estate loans (including multi-family loans) and commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction and consumer loans. We retain our loans in portfolio depending on market conditions, but we primarily sell our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. We also invest in various investment securities. Our revenue is derived principally from interest on loans and investments and loan sales. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and principal and interest payments on loans and securities.

 Market Area 
 We are headquartered in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, which is located in the northeast suburban area of metropolitan Philadelphia. We primarily serve communities located in Montgomery, Bucks and Philadelphia Counties in Pennsylvania and New Castle county in Delaware from our executive office, four full service bank offices and one limited service office. We also operate four loan production offices in our geographical footprint. 
 Our markets are demographically attractive, close to the business and financial district of Center City Philadelphia, and within commuting distance of Northern New Jersey and New York City. Based on the United States Census for estimated population for 2018, Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks and New Castle Counties have total populations of 1,584,000, 829,000, 628,000 and 559,000, respectively, and the Philadelphia, Montgomery, and Bucks counties comprise the 1st, 3rd and 4th largest counties in Pennsylvania, respectively and New Castle county is the largest county in Delaware. From 2010 to 2018 the estimated populations of Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks and New Castle Counties are expected to grow by 3.8%, 3.6%, 0.5% and 3.9%, respectively. Additionally, between June 2017 and June 2019, our market area has shown significant improvement in unemployment levels, decreasing from 6.4% to 5.2% for Philadelphia County, decreasing from 4.0% to 3.2% for Montgomery County, decreasing from 4.3% to 3.4% for Bucks County and decreasing from 4.9% to 3.6% for New Castle county.  The foreclosure rate in June 2019 for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was 3.0%, compared to foreclosure rates of 5.0%, 3.0%, and 4.0% for Philadelphia, Montgomery and Bucks Counties, respectively. The foreclosure rate in June 2019 for the Commonwealth of Delaware was 7.0%, compared to foreclosure rate of 9.0% for New Castle county. In terms of median household income and median disposable income, Montgomery and Bucks Counties rank 2nd and 3rd in Pennsylvania in each category, based on the United States Census. Based on the United States Census, the median household income between 2013 and 2017 was $40,649, $84,791, $82,031 and $68,336 Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks  and New Castle Counties, respectively.  The median value of owner occupied homes in Bucks County is nearly double the statewide median value, and home values in Bucks and Montgomery Counties rank 2nd and 3rd, respectively, of all the counties in Pennsylvania, based on the United States Census.

As of 2017, the Philadelphia metropolitan area is the eight largest total gross metropolitan product in the United States and is home to many universities and colleges.  The economy of our market area is heavily based on education, life sciences and social services. The city of Philadelphia is home to many Fortune 500 companies, including pharmaceutical distributor, AmerisourceBergen; cable television and internet provider Comcast; insurance company Lincoln Financial Group; and food services company Aramark. 
 Competition
 We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money centers and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Banks owned by large bank holding companies such as PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., Wells Fargo & Company, TD Bank, Santander and Citizens Financial Group, Inc. also operate in our market area. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. 
Lending Activities
 General.  Our principal lending activity is the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, and, to a lesser extent, construction loans and consumer loans. Our primary business has been the origination and sale of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, 56.7% of which have been adjustable-rate loans and 43.3% of which have been fixed-rate loans as of June 30, 2019. We currently sell in the secondary market most of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans, primarily jumbo loans, in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Lending.  At June 30, 2019, we had $201.5 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 83.8% of our total loan portfolio.  In addition, at June 30, 2019, we had $33.7 million of residential mortgages held for sale.  We originate fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans as well as adjustable-rate loans depending on market conditions and borrower preferences.  At June 30, 2019, 43.3% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans, and 56.7% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans.  
 Our fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans typically have terms of 10 to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines when the loan balance meets such guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.”  We generally originate both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits, which as of June 30, 2019 was generally $484,350 for single-family homes in our market area. We typically sell most of our fixed-rate conforming loans on a servicing-released basis. We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which are referred to as “jumbo loans,” that we retain in our portfolio. Jumbo loans that we originate typically have 15 to 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%.  At June 30, 2019, we had $127.0 million in jumbo loans, which represented 63.0% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Of the $127.0 million in jumbo loans, 68.3% or $86.7 million were variable jumbo loans and 31.7% or $40.3 million were fixed jumbo loans. Our average loan size for jumbo loans was $668,000 at June 30, 2019.  We also offer FHA, USDA and VA loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, USDA and VA guidelines. Most of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in our market area.  
 We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower.  Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 95%.   
 Our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans carry terms to maturity ranging from 10 to 30 years and generally have fixed rates for initial terms of five or seven years, and adjust annually thereafter at a margin, which in recent years has been tied to a margin above the LIBOR and Treasury rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may be increased or decreased is generally 5% for the first adjustment period and 2% per adjustment period thereafter, with a lifetime interest rate cap of generally 5% over the initial interest rate of the loan. We typically hold in portfolio our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. 
 Although adjustable-rate mortgage loans may reduce to an extent our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower.  At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates.  Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments.  Moreover, the interest rates on most of our adjustable-rate loans 
 
 
6

 
do not adjust for up to seven years after origination. As a result, the effectiveness of adjustable-rate mortgage loans in compensating for changes in market interest rates generally may be limited.
 We offer on a limited basis one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties. Generally, we require personal guarantees from the borrowers on these properties, and we will not make loans in excess of 85% loan-to-value on non-owner-occupied properties.  
 We  may offer “interest only” mortgage loans on construction to permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan).  We also have not offered and will not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We have not had a “subprime lending” program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios), or “Alt-A” loans (i.e., loans that generally target borrowers with better credit scores who borrow with alternative documentation such as little or no verification of income). 
 We generally require title insurance on all of our one- to four-family residential real estate mortgage loans, and we also require that borrowers maintain fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and, if appropriate, flood insurance) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the replacement cost of the improvements. Substantially all of our residential real estate mortgage loans have a mortgage escrow account from which disbursements are made for real estate taxes and flood insurance. We do not conduct environmental testing on residential real estate mortgage loans unless specific concerns for hazards are identified by the appraiser used in connection with the origination of the loan. If we identify an environmental problem on land that will secure a loan, the environmental hazard must be remediated before the closing of the loan.  
 When underwriting residential real estate loans, we review and verify each loan applicant’s employment, income and credit history and, if applicable, our experience with the borrower. Our policy is to obtain credit reports and financial statements on all borrowers and guarantors, and to verify references. Properties securing real estate loans are appraised by board-approved independent appraisers. Appraisals are subsequently reviewed by our loan underwriting department.
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We also offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, both of which are secured by either first mortgages or second mortgages on owner occupied one- to four-family residences.  At June 30, 2019, outstanding home equity loans and equity lines of credit totaled $4.2 million, or 1.7% of total loans outstanding.  At June 30, 2019, the unadvanced portion of home equity lines of credit totaled $7.7 million.  At June 30, 2019 $2.7 million of our home equity loans and lines of credit were in a junior lien position.
 The underwriting standards utilized for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit include a title review, the recordation of a lien, a determination of the applicant’s ability to satisfy existing debt obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan.  The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans and our lines of credit is generally limited to 80% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable.  Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest and with terms up to 20 years.  Our home equity lines of credit generally have 30-year terms and adjustable-rates of interest, subject to a contractual floor, which are indexed to the prime rate.  
 Commercial Real Estate Lending.  We also offer commercial real estate loans, including a limited amount of multi-family loans.  At June 30, 2019, we had $16.5 million in commercial real estate loans, representing 6.9% of our total loan portfolio.  Our commercial real estate loans generally have initial terms of five years and amortization terms of 20 to 25 years, with a balloon payment due at the end of the initial term. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial real estate loans is generally 75%.  Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by medical, retail, industrial, warehouse, service, or other commercial properties. We originate a limited number of multi-family loans generally secured by apartment buildings. At June 30, 2019, the average loan balance of our outstanding commercial real estate loans was $311,000, and the largest of such loans was a $1.3 million loan

secured by first perfected security interest in all of the borrower’s business assets. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at June 30, 2019.
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans.  We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history, and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan.  When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions.  In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service).  We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.20x.  All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the board of directors.  
 Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loan borrowers, although this requirement may be waived in limited circumstances depending upon the loan-to-value ratio and the debt service ratio associated with the loan. We require property, casualty and title insurance and flood insurance if the property is in a flood zone area.  
 Commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.  In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service.  Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property.  Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties.
 Commercial Business Lending.  At June 30, 2019, we had $9.7 million of commercial business loans, representing 4.1% of our total loan portfolio.  We offer regular lines of credit and revolving lines of credit with terms of up to 12 months to small businesses in our market area to finance short-term working capital needs such as accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit are typically adjustable-rate generally based on the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. We generally obtain personal guarantees with respect to all commercial business lines of credit. 
 We typically originate commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business, the experience and stability of the borrower’s management team, earnings projections and the underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. Commercial business loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral, primarily accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.  As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area.  Therefore, commercial business loans that we originate have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans or, generally, consumer loans.  In addition, commercial business loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
 Construction Lending.  We originate construction loans for the purchase of developed lots and for the construction of single-family residences.  Construction loans to individuals are made on the same general terms as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, but provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually six months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent appraiser. We also review and inspect each project prior to disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection of the project based on percentage of completion. At June 30, 2019, we had $2.0 million of construction loans, representing 0.8% of our total loan portfolio.  At June 30, 2019, our largest construction loan was a $1.7 million loan secured by residential real estate. This loan was performing in accordance with its original terms at June 30, 2019.

The maximum loan-to-value of these loans is 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property, and all these loans include personal guarantees. 
 Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment. Construction loans also expose us to the risks that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs and that repayment will depend on the successful operation or sale of the properties. In addition, some of these borrowers have more than one outstanding loan, so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non-payment and loss.
 
Medical Education Lending. In November 2017, the Bank entered into a loan purchase agreement with a broker to purchase a portfolio of private education loans made to American citizens attending American Medical Association (“AMA”) approved medical schools in Caribbean nations. The broker serves as a lender, holder, program designer and developer, administrator, and secondary market for the loan portfolios they generate. At June 30, 2019, the balance of the private education loans was $6.5 million. The private student loans were made following a proven credit criteria and were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s policies. At June 30, 2019, there were ten loans with a balance of approximately $841,000 that are past due 90 days or more. The Company allocated increased allowance for loan loss provisions to the medical education loans for the year ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of charge-offs totaling $305,000.
 Consumer Lending. At June 30, 2019, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $3,000 consisting of consumer overdraft accounts.
 Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales 
 Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel and from referrals from existing customers and real estate brokers. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures.  While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and pricing levels established by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our loan originations can vary from period to period.  
 Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis most of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we have originated. We consider our Statement of Financial Condition as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or to sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. For the year ended June 30, 2019, we sold $140.1 million of residential one- to four-family real estate loans. 
 From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At June 30, 2019, we had five participation loans for $5.3 million in which we were not the lead lender, all of which were performing in accordance with the loans’ original terms at June 30, 2019. We also have participated out portions of loans from time to time that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for risk diversification.  
 We currently have arrangements with full-service mortgage lenders to purchase primarily jumbo adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we purchased $16.0 million of such loans pursuant to these relationships. These loans are originated pursuant to our underwriting guidelines and subject to our underwriting process prior to when we purchase the loan.  We intend to maintain these

current relationships and in the future we will look for additional opportunities to expand our purchase of one- to four-family real estate loans.
In November 2017, we purchased a $7.8 million portfolio of private education loans made to American citizens attending AMA approved medical schools in Caribbean nations. The private student loans were made following a proven credit criteria and were underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s policies. At June 30, 2019, the balance of the private education loans was $6.5 million.
 The following table shows our loan originations, sales and repayment activities for the years indicated, including loans held for sale.

 Loans to One Borrower. Pursuant to applicable law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of Huntingdon Valley Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% if secured by “readily marketable collateral”). This 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus was approximately $4.5 million as of June 30, 2019.  At June 30, 2019, our largest credit relationship was $4.1 million which consisted of a $3.7 million loan secured by first perfected security interest in all of the borrower’s business assets that was paid off in July 2019 and a $683,000 loan secured by a mortgage on a residential one-to-four property. At June 30, 2019, these loans was performing in accordance with its current terms. 
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.  Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the board of directors. In the approval process for residential loans, we assess the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the value of the property securing the loan. To assess the borrower's ability to repay, we review the borrower's income and expenses and employment and credit history. In the case of commercial real estate loans, we also review projected income, expenses and the viability of the project being financed. We generally require appraisals of all real property securing loans. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers who are approved by our board of directors. All real estate secured loans generally require fire, title and casualty insurance and, if warranted, flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the maximum amount available. Our loan approval policies and limits are also established by our board of directors. All loans originated by Huntingdon Valley Bank are subject to our underwriting guidelines. 

10

 
The following limitations apply to originations of loans.  An underwriter may approve loans up to $417,000 or FHA loan limit, and an executive vice president, assistant vice president or senior underwriter officer may approve loans up to $500,000.  The Officer Loan Committee must approve “jumbo” loans (currently, loans between $500,000 to $650,000), construction loans and any conventional loans not receiving automated underwriting system recommendation.  The Executive Management Committee must approve loans in excess of $650,000.  The board of directors must approve loans in excess of $900,000 that are exceptions to the Bank’s lending policy.
 Delinquencies, Non-Performing Assets and Classified Assets
 Delinquency Procedures. When a loan is 15 days past due, we send the borrower a late notice. We generally also contact the borrower by phone if the delinquency is not corrected promptly after the notice has been sent. When the loan is 30 days past due, we mail the borrower a letter reminding the borrower of the delinquency, and attempt to contact the borrower personally to determine the reason for the delinquency in order to ensure that the borrower understands the terms of the loan and the importance of making payments on or before the due date. If necessary, subsequent delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. By the 90th day of delinquency, we will send the borrower a final demand for payment and may recommend foreclosure. Loans are charged off when we believe that the recovery of principal is improbable. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the board of directors each month.

Non-Performing Loans.  Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is more than 90 days delinquent. Loans are also placed on non-accrual status if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt or if the loan has been restructured. Loans are classified as troubled debt restructurings when certain modifications are made to the loan terms and concessions are granted to the borrowers due to financial difficulty experienced by those borrowers. At June 30, 2019, we had no non-accruing troubled debt restructurings. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received. Generally, the loan may be restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally six months, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended June 30, 2019 had non-accruing loans been current according to their original terms amounted to $111,000.  We recognized $35,000 of interest income for these loans for the year ended June 30, 2019.  
 
Other Real Estate Owned.  Other real estate owned includes assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure and are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of 

12

 
foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value less estimated selling costs. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in operations. We had no other real estate owned at June 30, 2019 and 2018. 
 Non-Performing Assets. The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. We had one loan accruing past due 90 days at June 30, 2018 and no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at June 30, 2019, 2017, 2016 or 2015. Additionally, we had no non-accruing troubled debt restructurings at June 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 or 2015.

Total non-performing loans increased to $3.3 million, or 1.36% of total loans, at June 30, 2019 from $1.6 million, or 0.73% of total loans, at June 30, 2018 as a result of an increase of $1.1 million increase in medical education loans, a $423,000 increase in non-performing one- to four-family residential real estate loans as well as an increase in non-performing home equity and HELOCs of $211,000. Non-performing one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled $1.9 million at June 30, 2019.  Non-performing medical education loans totaled $1.1 million at June 30, 2019. There were no non-performing commercial real estate loans, commercial business and construction loans at June 30, 2019. 
 Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.”  An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” 

13

 
that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.”  Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for loan losses is not warranted.  Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.  At June 30, 2019, we had $208,000 of  loans designated as “special mention.”
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate.  General allowances represent allowances which have been established to cover accrued losses associated with lending activities that were both probable and reasonable to estimate, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.  An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances.
 In connection with the filing of our periodic regulatory reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.  Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed. Management reviews the status of each loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis with the full board of directors. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,”  “substandard,”  “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”  
 The following table sets forth our amounts of classified assets and assets designated as special mention as of June 30, 2019, 2018 or 2017.  The classified assets total at June 30, 2019 includes $3.3 million of non-performing loans.

Total criticized assets | $ | 4,034 | | $ | 2,991 | | $ | 2,756

 
The increase in classified assets was due to a $1.1 million increase in substandard assets primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in substandard medical education loans and $211,000 increase in substandard home equity one- to four-family residential real estate loans offset by decreases of $134,000 in substandard one- to four-family residential real estate loans, $73,000 in commercial real estate loans and $61,000 in commercial business. Substandard assets at June 30, 2019 consisted of $3.3 million in non-accrual loans and $500,000 in loans that were performing. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses  
 Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.   The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses. We maintain the allowance at a level believed, to the best of management’s knowledge, to cover all known and inherent losses in the portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 

14

 
at each reporting date. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses on no less than a quarterly basis in order to identify those inherent losses and to assess the overall collection probability for the loan portfolio. The evaluation process includes, among other things, an analysis of delinquency trends, non-performing loan trends, the level of charge-offs and recoveries, prior loss experience, total loans outstanding, the volume of loan originations, the type, size and geographic concentration of the loans, the value of collateral securing the loan, the borrower’s ability to repay and repayment performance, the number of loans requiring heightened management oversight, local economic conditions and industry experience. Such risk factors are periodically reviewed by management and revised as deemed appropriate. The establishment of the allowance for loan losses is significantly affected by management’s judgment and uncertainties, and there is likelihood that different amounts would be reported under different conditions or assumptions. The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses. These regulators may require us to make additional provisions for estimated loan losses based upon judgments different from those of management.
 The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers pools of loans by loan class. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans, adjusted for qualitative factors. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. 
 We will continue to monitor and modify our allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. No assurances can be given that the level of allowance for loan losses will cover all of the inherent losses on the loans or that future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses will not be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the economic and other conditions used by management to determine the current level of the allowance for loan losses.

At June 30, 2019, our allowance for loan losses represented 0.49% of total loans and 36.08% of non-performing loans.  There were $300,000 in net loan charge-offs during the year ended June 30, 2019. 
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.  Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the 
 
 
17

 
quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result.  Furthermore, as an integral part of its examination process, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking will periodically review our allowance for loan losses.  The FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking may require that we increase our allowance based on its judgments of information available to it at the time of its examination.  Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Investment Activities
 General. Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. Our current investment policy authorizes us to invest in debt securities issued by the United States Government, agencies of the United States Government or United States Government-sponsored enterprises. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities, issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, as well as investments in federal funds and deposits in other insured institutions. In addition, management is authorized to invest in investment grade state and municipal obligations, commercial paper and corporate debt obligations within regulatory parameters. We do not engage in any investment hedging activities or trading activities, nor do we purchase any high-risk mortgage derivative products, corporate junk bonds, and certain types of structured notes.
 The objectives of the policy are to:  
  
• | enhance profitability within our overall asset/liability management objectives;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | absorb funds when loan demand is low and infuse funds when demand is high;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide liquidity necessary to conduct our day‑to‑day business activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | add high credit quality assets to our balance sheet;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | improve our interest rate risk management by providing a method for maintaining an appropriate balance between the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of: 1) interest income from loans and investments; and 2) interest expense from deposits and borrowings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide collateral for pledging requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | generate a favorable return on investments without compromising other investment objectives; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluate and take advantage of opportunities to generate tax-exempt income when it is appropriate given our tax position.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Generally accepted accounting principles require that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security. Securities designated as available-for -sale are reported at fair value, while securities designated as held- to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. We do not maintain a trading portfolio. Establishing a trading portfolio would require specific authorization by the board of directors.
 At June 30, 2019, the held-to-maturity portfolio, with an amortized cost of $14.3 million was reclassified to available-for-sale. The available-for-sale portfolio, which is carried at fair value, totaled $35.2 million, or 10.2% of total assets at June 30, 2019.
 United States Governmental Securities. We maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, at zero risk weighting for capital purposes and as collateral for borrowings. At June 30, 2019, United States government securities consisted of fixed-rate Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Participation Certificates. 
 Corporate Notes. At time of purchase, we invest in investment grade corporate bonds, both fixed and floating rate instruments, and generally consisting of corporate bonds issued by large financial institutions.
 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations. We invest in fixed rate collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. A CMO is a type of mortgage-backed security that creates 

18

 
separate pools of pass-through rates for different classes of bondholders with varying maturities, called tranches. The repayments from the pool of pass-through securities are used to retire the bonds in the order specified by the bonds’ prospectus.
 Ginnie Mae is a government agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development and is intended to help finance government-assisted housing programs. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration. The timely payment of principal and interest on Ginnie Mae securities is guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. Government. Freddie Mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans. Freddie Mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates. Fannie Mae is a private corporation chartered by the U.S. government with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans. Fannie Mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on Fannie Mae securities. 
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. We have not purchased privately-issued mortgage-backed securities. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or acceleration of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates.
 Municipal Securities. We invest in fixed-rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
 Bank Certificates of Deposit. We invest in certificates of deposit issued by geographically dispersed large financial institutions that are insured by the FDIC.
 The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio (excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh common stock) at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
 General.  Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities.  We may also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances, to supplement cash flow needs, as necessary.  In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan prepayments, retained income and income on earning assets.  While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 Deposits.  Our deposits are generated primarily from residents, municipalities and businesses within our market area.  We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and checking accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate.  At June 30, 2019, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit, were $193.8 million, representing 70.4% of total deposits. At June 30, 2019, we had $41.0 million in brokered deposits.
 Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis.  Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands.  Our ability to generate deposits is affected by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products.  We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. 
 The following table sets forth the distribution of total interest-bearing deposits by account type for the years indicated.

Borrowings.  We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and certain of our mortgage loans.  Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities.  At June 30, 2019, we had $28.0 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.  At June 30, 2019, based on available collateral and our ownership of Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh stock, we had access to Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh advances of up to $122.5 million. Additionally, at June 30, 2019, we had the ability to borrow $3.0 million from the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and we maintained a line of credit equal to 95% of fair value of collateral held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which was $1.7 million at June 30, 2019. We have not borrowed against the credit lines with the Atlantic Community Bankers Bank or the Federal Reserve Bank during the year ended June 30, 2019.

Regulation and Supervision 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a savings bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lending, investment, and other business operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank are governed by Pennsylvania law and regulations, as well as applicable federal law and regulations, and Huntingdon Valley Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not authorized by such laws and regulations. Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC.  This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders.  Huntingdon Valley Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  
 Under this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish minimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves for

regulatory purposes; and establish the timing and amounts of insurance assessments and other fees.  Moreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings institutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors.  The receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in enforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution.  A less than satisfactory rating may also prevent a financial institution, such as Huntingdon Valley Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory approvals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.
 In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations, Community Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations.  Government agencies have the authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and regulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial institutions or expand our branch network.
 As a bank holding company, HV Bancorp is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").  It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board.  HV Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.  
 Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank.  
 Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Huntingdon Valley Bank and HV Bancorp.  The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Huntingdon Valley Bank and HV Bancorp.
 The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018
 On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The EGRRCPA’s highlights include, among other things: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not require appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempt banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarify that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raise eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; and (vi) simplify capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status.  On September 17, 2019, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation passed a final rule on the community bank leverage ratio, setting the minimum required community bank leverage ratio at 9%. The rule will go into effect January 1, 2020. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board was required to raise the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank or savings and loan holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities.  
Pennsylvania Bank Regulation 
 Activity Powers.  The Pennsylvania Department of Banking will regulate the internal organization of Huntingdon Valley Bank, as well as our activities, including, deposit-taking, lending and investment.  The basic authority for our activities is specified by Pennsylvania law and by regulations, policies and directives issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking.  The FDIC also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, and federal law limits some of the authority that the Pennsylvania Department of Banking grants to us.   
 Examination and Enforcement.  The Pennsylvania Department of Banking regularly examines state chartered banks in such areas as reserves, loans, investments, management practices and other aspects of operations.  Although the Pennsylvania Department of Banking may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of its own examinations, the current practice is for the Pennsylvania 

24
--

 

Department of Banking to conduct individual examinations.  The Pennsylvania Department of Banking may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Pennsylvania Department of Banking has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Pennsylvania Department of Banking why such person should not be removed. 
 Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations.  With certain specified exceptions, a Pennsylvania chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of a savings bank’s capital accounts. Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, loans which are secured by collateral which has a market value of not less than 120% of the amount of the obligations secured by such collateral are excluded from the loan-to-one-borrower limitation up to an aggregate limit for 15% of the savings bank’s capital accounts. 
 Loans to Huntingdon Valley Bank’s Insiders.  Pennsylvania law provides that we may make loans to our executive officers and directors and greater than 10% stockholders in accordance with federal regulations, as discussed below.    
 Dividend Restrictions.  HV Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary, Huntingdon Valley Bank.  There are various legal and regulatory restrictions on the extent to which Huntingdon Valley Bank can, among other things, finance or otherwise supply funds to HV Bancorp. Specifically, dividends from Huntingdon Valley Bank are the principal source of HV Bancorp’s cash funds and there are certain legal restrictions under Pennsylvania law and regulations on the payment of dividends by state-chartered banks.  The Pennsylvania Department of Banking, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board also have authority to prohibit HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank from engaging in certain practices deemed to be unsafe and unsound.  The payment of dividends could, depending upon the condition of HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice.   
 The Pennsylvania Banking Code regulates the distribution of dividends by banks and states, in part, that dividends may be declared and paid only out of accumulated net earnings.  In addition, we may not declare and pay dividends from the surplus funds that Pennsylvania law requires that we maintain.  Each year we will be required to set aside as surplus funds a sum equal to not less than 10% of our net earnings until the surplus funds equal 100% of our capital stock.  We may invest surplus funds in the same manner as deposits, subject to certain exceptions.  In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if a savings bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the FDIC. 
 Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking impose on Pennsylvania chartered depository institutions, including Huntingdon Valley Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. See “—Federal Bank Regulation—Capital Requirements.”
Federal Bank Regulation 
 Capital Requirements.  Federal regulations require state savings banks to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a total capital to risk-based assets ratio; and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.  The capital standards were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of regulations implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel III”) and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The risk-based capital standards for state savings banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets ratios of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively.  In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.  Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.  Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings.  Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.  Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.  Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.  Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.  Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.  Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.  In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  For 2019, the capital conservation buffer is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EGRRCPA simplifies capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules.  Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized, although the regulators retain the flexibility to determine that the institution may not qualify for the community bank leverage ratio test based on the institution’s risk profile.  Until the community bank leverage ratio is established by the regulators in accordance with EGRRCPA, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect. On September 17, 2019, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation passed a final rule on the community bank leverage ratio, setting the minimum required community bank leverage ratio at 9%. The rule will go into effect January 1, 2020.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The FDIC, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness.  As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 Investment Activities.  All FDIC insured banks, including savings banks, are generally limited in their equity investment activities to equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, a state bank may engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined by the FDIC that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 
 Interstate Banking and Branching.  Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, among other things, recent amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.  Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015.  An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 
 
 
26

8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 As noted above, the EGRRCPA will eliminate these requirements for savings banks with less than $10.0 billion in assets who elect to follow the community bank leverage ratio. On September 17, 2019, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation passed a final rule on the community bank leverage ratio, setting the minimum required community bank leverage ratio at 9%. The rule will go into effect January 1, 2020.
 At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits.  Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan.  Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment.  An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to, an order by the FDIC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 Transactions with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations.  Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus.  Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions.  Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate.  In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. 
 Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal stockholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% stockholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these persons, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.

Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including Huntingdon Valley Bank. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. 
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.  Huntingdon Valley Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Huntingdon Valley Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, which has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.  Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.  An institution’s rate depended upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.  Institutions deemed less risky pay lower FDIC assessments.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.  The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.  
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories.  Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years.  In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points.
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature by September 2019. For the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.12 of a basis point of total assets less tangible capital. 
 Privacy Regulations.  Federal regulations generally require that Huntingdon Valley Bank disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. Huntingdon Valley Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

Community Reinvestment Act.  Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by federal regulations, a state member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a state savings bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Huntingdon Valley Bank’s latest federal CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”  
 USA Patriot Act.  Huntingdon Valley Bank is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act contains provisions intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Other Regulations 
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Huntingdon Valley Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates.  Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The deposit operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank also are subject to, among others, the: 
  
• | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Reserve System 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for that portion of transaction accounts aggregating $124.2 million or less (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) the reserve requirement is 3.0%, and for amounts greater than $124.2 million the reserve requirement is 10.0% (which may be adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board to between 8.0% and 14.0%). The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances (which may be adjusted by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. Huntingdon Valley Bank is in compliance with these requirements.  
Federal Home Loan Bank System 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. Huntingdon Valley Bank was in

compliance with this requirement at June 30, 2019. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Huntingdon Valley Bank reviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh stock. As of June 30, 2019, no impairment has been recognized. 
 Holding Company Regulation 
 HV Bancorp, as a bank holding company, is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. HV Bancorp is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for HV Bancorp to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including that its depository institution subsidiaries are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company.” A “financial holding company” may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking.  HV Bancorp has not elected to become a “financial holding company.” 
 HV Bancorp is not subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies.  The EGRRCPA required the Federal Reserve Board to generally extend its "Small Bank Holding Company" exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements to bank and savings and loan holding companies of up to $3 billion in assets. Regulations implementing the new legislation were effective in August 2018. Consequently, bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets remain exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise in particular cases. 
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.  The Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance which requires consultation with the Federal Reserve Board prior to a redemption or repurchase in certain circumstances.

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy.  Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of HV Bancorp to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of HV Bancorp or Huntingdon Valley Bank. 
 HV Bancorp’s status as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 Federal Securities Laws
 HV Bancorp common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  HV Bancorp is also subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in HV Bancorp’s public offering does not cover the resale of those shares.  Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of HV Bancorp may be resold without registration.  Shares purchased by an affiliate of HV Bancorp will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933.  If HV Bancorp meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of HV Bancorp that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of HV Bancorp, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, HV Bancorp may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933.
 Emerging Growth Company Status
 On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets.  Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.”  We qualify as an “emerging growth company” and believe that we will continue to qualify as an “emerging growth company” for five years from the completion of our initial public stock offering.
 Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions, we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) hold non-binding stockholder votes regarding annual executive compensation or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger or similar corporate transaction, (iv) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (v) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.  However, we will not be subject to additional executive compensation disclosure, regardless of the exemptions, so long as we remain a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $250 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates).

We could remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (b) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws.  We have policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 Change in Control Regulations
 Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as HV Bancorp unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.  Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution.  Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with HV Bancorp, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.
 TAXATION
 Federal Taxation
 General.  HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.  The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to HV Bancorp and Huntingdon Valley Bank.
 Method of Accounting.  For federal income tax purposes, Huntingdon Valley Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending June 30th for filing its federal income tax returns.  
 Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, Huntingdon Valley Bank has been subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996, pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), that eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1988. Huntingdon Valley Bank recaptured its excess reserve balance. 
 Currently, Huntingdon Valley Bank uses the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. At June 30, 2019, our total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $1.7 million upon which no deferred taxes have been provided. Under current law, pre-base year reserves remain subject to recapture should Huntingdon Valley Bank make certain non-dividend distributions, repurchase any of its stock, pay dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or cease to maintain a bank charter.

Minimum Tax.  On December 22, 2017, federal tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), was enacted. The Tax Act repealed alternative minimum tax effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Any alternative minimum tax credit carryovers to tax years after December 31, 2017 generally may be utilized to the extent of the Company’s regular tax liability offset by any minimum tax credit the Company may have for that year. In addition, for tax years beginning in 2018, 2019 and 2020, to the extent that the alternative minimum tax credit carryovers exceed regular tax liability offset by certain other tax credits, 50% of the excess alternative minimum tax credit carryovers are refundable. Any remaining alternative minimum tax credits will be fully refundable in 2021. At June 30, 2019, Huntingdon Valley Bank had approximately $53,000 in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers.  The Tax Act repealed carrying back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. The Tax Act provides for the indefinite carryforward of federal net operating losses arising in tax years ending after 2017.  Also as a result of The Tax Act, net operating losses arising in tax years after 2017 may only reduce 80 percent of a taxpayer’s taxable income in carryforward years.  At June 30, 2019, Huntingdon Valley Bank had no federal net operating loss carryforwards and had no Pennsylvania state net operating loss carryforwards available for future use.
 Capital Loss Carryovers.  Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years.  Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried.  As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which carried and is used to offset any capital gains.  Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible.   At June 30, 2019, Huntingdon Valley Bank had no capital loss carryover.
 Corporate Dividends.  We may generally exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from Huntingdon Valley Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
 Audit of Tax Returns.  Huntingdon Valley Bank’s income tax returns have not been audited in the past five years.
 State Taxation 
 Huntingdon Valley Bank currently files Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institution Income Tax returns. Generally, the income of savings institutions in Pennsylvania, which is calculated based on generally accepted accounting principles, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to Pennsylvania tax. Huntingdon Valley Bank had no Pennsylvania state tax net operating loss carryforwards at June 30, 2019.
