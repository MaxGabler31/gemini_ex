Overview 
 
We are a medical device company with an innovative approach to the design, development and commercialization of products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. We believe our competitive advantage is rooted in our unique consumer-focused approach, and the incorporation of modern and innovative technology into our product offerings. Our manufacturing and sales activities primarily focus on our flagship product, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim X2, which is based on our proprietary technology platform. The simple-to-use t:slim X2 is the smallest durable insulin pump available, and the only pump currently available that is capable of remote feature updates, which positions us well to address the evolving needs and preferences of differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. By delivering innovative hardware and software solutions, as well as best-in-class customer support, we aim to improve and simplify the lives of people with diabetes and their healthcare providers. 
 
We have commercially launched five insulin pumps since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. Two of these pumps have featured continuous glucose monitoring technology, or CGM. Since the launch of our first product in August 2012, through December 2017, we have shipped nearly 68,000 pumps to customers in the United States. In 2017, we announced plans to begin commercialization of t:slim X2 in select geographies outside the United States, including Canada, during 2018. 
 
We began commercial sales of our first insulin pump, the t:slim Insulin Delivery System, or t:slim, in August 2012. During 2015, we commenced commercial sales of two additional insulin pumps: t:flex in May 2015 and t:slim G4 in September 2015. In October 2016, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 and discontinued new sales of t:slim. In September 2017, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 integrated with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system, which is manufactured by Dexcom, and discontinued new sales of t:slim G4. In 2017, t:slim X2 represented approximately 95% of our new pump shipments. In September 2017, we also commenced commercial sales of cartridge and infusion set products using our custom t:lock, which replaces the standard Luer-lok connector that historically joined an infusion set to our cartridge.
 
All people with type 1 diabetes require daily rapid-acting insulin, but only a subset of people with type 2 diabetes require daily rapid-acting insulin, as a majority manage their therapy through improvements in diet and exercise, oral medications, or injectable therapies such as long acting insulin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, approximately 23 million people in the United States had diagnosed diabetes, of which type 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 5% to 10%, or approximately 1.2 to 2.3 million people. Of people with type 2 diabetes in the United States, the CDC reports that approximately 14%, or 3.2 million people, manage their diabetes with insulin only. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that in 2017 approximately 425 million people had diabetes worldwide, of which approximately 10%, or 42.5 million, had type 1. Our target market consists of people in the United States, and select geographies worldwide beginning in 2018, who require daily rapid-acting insulin.
 
Our insulin pump products are generally considered durable medical equipment, and have an expected lifespan of at least four years. In addition to selling insulin pumps, we sell disposable products that are used together with our pumps and replaced every few days, including cartridges for storing and delivering insulin, and infusion sets that connect the insulin pump to a user’s body. Although we commenced commercial sales of t:lock in September 2017, we continue to offer cartridges and infusion sets with a standard Luer-lok connector on a limited basis to facilitate customer transition to our new t:lock products.

Each of our insulin pump products is compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a unique tool that allows our pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater provides our customers access to new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. Its first cleared use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, was to update t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015 to the latest software. In September 2017, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing t:slim X2 customers integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system through a software update using the Tandem Device Updater. Within the first 30 days following the FDA approval of this update, more than 30% of t:slim X2 customers who purchased their pump prior to its availability had updated their pump. By the end of 2017 more than 40% of t:slim X2 customers had updated their pump and now have access to Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration. In October 2017, we announced that, subject to FDA approval, we intend to make any new features approved by the FDA in 2018 available to all in-warranty users of t:slim X2 at no cost through the Tandem Device Updater. In the future, this tool has the potential to enable users to add other new features and functionality to their pumps, such as automated insulin delivery algorithms, or AID algorithms, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. 
 
Our innovative approach to product design and development is consumer-focused and based on our extensive market research, as we believe the user is the primary decision maker when purchasing an insulin pump. Our market research consists of interviews, focus groups and online surveys to understand what people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking in order to improve diabetes therapy management. We also apply the science of human factors to our design and development process. By doing so, we seek to optimize our products, which allows for them to be successfully operated by users in their intended environment. 
 
We have developed our products to provide the specific features people with insulin-dependent diabetes and healthcare providers seek in a next-generation insulin pump. Our use of modern consumer technologies, and a proprietary pumping technology, has allowed us to design the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market, without sacrificing insulin capacity. t:slim X2 features our patented Micro-Delivery technology, a miniaturized pumping mechanism that draws insulin from a flexible bag within the pump’s cartridge, rather than relying on a lead screw driven syringe mechanism. It also features an easy-to-navigate software architecture, a vivid color touchscreen, an advanced Bluetooth radio capable of communicating with multiple compatible devices, such as a CGM sensor, blood glucose meter or mobile applications, and a micro-USB connection that supports a rechargeable battery, software updates through the Tandem Device Updater, as well as uploads to the t:connect Diabetes Management Application, or t:connect. t:connect is our custom cloud-based data management application that provides our customers and healthcare providers a fast, easy and visual way to display therapy management data from the pump and supported blood glucose meters.
 
Based on customer surveys, approximately half of our customers are new to insulin pump therapy, and the average age of our existing customers is 31 years old, with relatively equal distribution between men and women. Of the customers who converted from another manufacturers’ pump, the greatest percentage converted from Medtronic, followed by Animas. However, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we did see a meaningful increase in our sales to former Animas pump users. 
 
Between July 2016 and September 2017, we offered a Technology Upgrade Program to provide eligible customers a pathway to ownership of a t:slim X2. During the term of the Program, depending on the type of pump sold, we were required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and related guidelines to defer some or all of the sales and cost of sales until a later date. This prevented us from recognizing up to 100% of the sales and cost of sales associated with the sale of our t:slim and t:slim G4 insulin pumps to eligible customers at the time of shipment. In general, the deferrals required by the Program had the effect of initially decreasing our sales, particularly in the second half of 2016, even when the number of our pump shipments increased, then benefiting our sales at the conclusion of the Program in 2017. 
 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our sales were $107.6 million, $84.2 million, and $72.9 million, respectively. For the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $73.0 million, $83.4 million, and $72.4 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded incremental net sales of $5.0 million with a corresponding increase in gross profit of $3.1 million as a result of our Technology Upgrade Program. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded net sales deferrals of $4.3 million and recognized an additional net cost of sales of $0.3 million as a result of our Technology Upgrade Program. Pump sales accounted for 66%, 74%, and 83% of sales, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, while pump-related supplies primarily accounted for the remainder in each year. Sales of accessories were not material in any of these periods. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $477.6 million and $404.6 million, respectively.

We have rapidly increased sales since our commercial launch by expanding our sales, clinical and marketing infrastructure, by developing, commercializing and marketing multiple differentiated products that utilize our proprietary technology platform and consumer-focused approach, and by providing strong customer support. In our research, approximately 86% of healthcare providers surveyed believe that providing great customer support is the most important attribute in an insulin pump manufacturer. We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market. We also believe we are well positioned to address consumers’ needs and preferences with our current products and products under development and by offering customers a pathway to our future innovations through the Tandem Device Updater, as they are approved by the FDA. As we continue to develop differentiated products based on our proprietary technology platform, our strategy is to leverage a single sales, marketing and clinical organization, a shared manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and the expertise of our customer support services.
 
Our headquarters and our manufacturing facility are located in San Diego, California and we employed 574 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017.
 
The Market 
 
Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is categorized by improper function of the pancreas when it either does not produce enough insulin or the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a life-sustaining hormone that allows cells in the body to absorb glucose from blood and convert it to energy. As a result, a person with diabetes cannot utilize the glucose properly and it continues to accumulate in the blood. If not closely monitored and properly treated, diabetes can lead to serious medical complications, including damage to various tissues and organs, seizures, coma and death. 
 
The IDF estimates that in 2017, approximately 425 million people had diabetes worldwide and that by 2045, this number will increase to 629 million people worldwide. According to the CDC, approximately 23 million people in the United States have diagnosed diabetes. 
 
There are two primary types of diabetes: 
 
 
• | The IDF estimates that people with type 1 diabetes represent approximately 10% of the diabetes population worldwide, or approximately 42.5 million people. Similarly, the CDC estimates that people with type 1 diabetes represent approximately 5% to 10% of individuals with diagnosed diabetes in the United States, or approximately 1.2 to 2.3 million people.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The IDF estimates that people with type 2 diabetes represent approximately 90% of the diabetes population worldwide, or approximately 382.5 million people. Similarly, the CDC estimates that people with type 2 diabetes represent approximately 90% to 95% of individuals with diagnosed diabetes in the United States, or approximately 20.7 to 21.8 million people. Initially, many people with type 2 diabetes attempt to manage their diabetes with improvements in diet, exercise and oral medications. However, as their diabetes advances, some patients progress to requiring injectable therapies, such as long-acting insulin, and a subset of this population will require daily rapid-acting insulin therapy. Approximately 14% of people with type 2 diabetes in the United States, or 3.2 million people, manage their diabetes with insulin only.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Throughout this Annual Report, we refer to people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who require daily rapid acting insulin as people with insulin-dependent diabetes. 
 
People with insulin-dependent diabetes require intensive insulin therapy to manage their blood glucose levels within a healthy range, which is typically between 70-120 milligrams per deciliter, or mg/dL. Blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, such as type or quantity of food eaten, illness, stress and exercise. Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose levels, can cause a variety of long-term effects or complications, including damage to various tissues and organs, seizures, coma or death. Hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, can also cause a variety of long-term effects or complications, including cardiovascular disease and damage to various tissues and organs. It can also cause the emergency condition ketoacidosis, which can result in vomiting, shortness of breath, coma or death. According to the CDC, in 2014 there were approximately 245,000 emergency department visits for adults with hypoglycemia, and approximately 207,000 visits for hyperglycemic crisis in the United States.

There are two primary therapies used by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, insulin injections and insulin pumps, each of which is designed to supplement or replace the insulin-producing function of the pancreas. Insulin injections are often referred to as MDI and involve the use of syringes or insulin pens to inject insulin into the person’s body. Insulin pumps are used to perform what is often referred to as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or insulin pump therapy, and typically use a programmable device and an infusion set to administer insulin into the person’s body. 
 
MDI therapy involves the administration of a rapid-acting insulin before meals, or bolus insulin, to bring blood glucose levels down into the healthy range. MDI therapy may also require a separate injection of a long-acting insulin, or basal insulin, to control glucose levels between meals; this type of insulin is typically taken once or twice per day. Insulin pump therapy, by comparison, uses only rapid-acting insulin to fulfill both mealtime (bolus) and background (basal) requirements. Insulin pump therapy allows a person to customize their bolus and basal insulin doses to meet their insulin needs throughout the day, and is intended to more closely resemble the physiologic function of a healthy pancreas.
 
Insulin pump therapy has been shown to provide people with insulin-dependent diabetes with numerous advantages relative to MDI therapy. The following chart illustrates some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using MDI therapy versus insulin pump therapy:
 
6

Comparison of MDI Therapy vs. Insulin Pump Therapy 
 
 
Therapy | Advantages | Disadvantages 
---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple Daily Injection, or MDI | ● Less training and shorter time to educate ● Less cost ● Lower risk of technological malfunction | ● Requires injections up to seven times per day ● Delivers insulin less accurately than insulin pumps ● Results in greater variability in blood glucose levels or less accurate glycemic control ● Requires more planning around and restrictions regarding meals and exercise 
Insulin Pump | ● Eliminates individual insulin injections ● Delivers insulin more accurately and precisely than injections ● Often improves HbA1c, a common measure of blood glucose levels over time ● Fewer large swings in blood glucose levels ● Provides greater flexibility with meals, exercise and daily schedules ● Can improve quality of life ● Reduces severe low blood glucose episodes ● Eliminates unpredictable effects of intermediate or long-acting insulin ● Allows exercise without having to eat large amounts of carbohydrates, as insulin delivery can be adjusted | ● Requires intensive education on insulin pump therapy and management ● Wearing a pump can be bothersome ● More costly ● Risk of diabetic ketoacidosis if the catheter comes out and insulin infusion is interrupted 

 
According to the American Diabetes Association, it is estimated that between 750,000 and 1 million people worldwide used an insulin pump. Domestically, we estimate that 550,000 people in the United States use an insulin pump, of which approximately 80% have type 1 diabetes.
 
Insulin pump therapy can provide a person with insulin-dependent diabetes with benefits when used independently or in conjunction with CGM. A pump featuring integrated CGM is known as a sensor augmented pump, or SAP, which allows the pump to receive CGM data directly from a wearable sensor. In addition, SAPs may feature an AID algorithm that is designed to automatically adjust a person’s insulin delivery based on their CGM trends to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemic events.

We believe that the distinct advantages and increased awareness of insulin pump therapy as compared to other available insulin therapies will continue to generate demand for insulin pump devices and pump-related supplies. We also believe that the adoption of insulin pump therapy would have been even greater if not for the significant and fundamental perceived shortcomings of durable syringe-and-plunger insulin pumps currently available, which we refer to as traditional pumps. We further believe that recent and ongoing developments in the use of CGM technology and AID algorithms in conjunction with insulin pump therapy will continue to provide people with insulin-dependent diabetes benefits that will make insulin pump therapy an even more attractive treatment alternative.
 
The Opportunity
 
The foundation of our consumer-focused approach is market research, through which we seek to better understand the opportunity within the insulin-dependent diabetes market. This opportunity includes both the introduction of the benefits of pump therapy to people using MDI and the introduction of the features and benefits of our pumps to people who use traditional pumps. We have conducted extensive research obtained from interviews, focus groups and online surveys to understand what people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers are seeking to improve in diabetes therapy management, as we believe the user is the primary decision-maker when purchasing an insulin pump. Based on our research, we believe that the limited adoption of insulin pump therapy by people with insulin-dependent diabetes has been largely due to the shortcomings of traditional pumps currently available. These shortcomings include:  
 
Antiquated style. While consumer electronic devices have rapidly evolved in form and function over the past decade, traditional pumps have not achieved similar advances. Our market research has shown that consumers believe traditional pumps resemble dated consumer technology, such as a pager, as they generally still feature small display screens, push-button interfaces, plastic cases and disposable batteries. Because an insulin pump must be used multiple times throughout the day, often in social settings, its style and appearance are important to users. Our market research has shown that traditional insulin pump users frequently report being embarrassed by the style of their traditional pump. For current MDI users, the style of traditional pumps is often cited as a reason for not adopting pump therapy. 
 
Not adaptable. Traditional pumps are typically sold as a single-product offering that are then iterated to add features, rather than being designed as a technology platform that is easily updatable to support new features and functionality as they are developed and approved by the FDA. We believe this is due to hardware and user interface limitations that prevent traditional pumps from being easily updatable to provide new feature offerings. As a result, consumers have had limited product choices from pump manufacturers, and healthcare providers are required to learn a greater number of user interfaces. We believe the lack of adaptability of traditional pump platforms has been a restricting factor in offering people with diabetes differentiated product features to best meet their therapy needs.
 
Bulky size. Our market research has shown that consumers view traditional pumps as large, bulky and inconvenient to carry or wear, especially when compared to modern consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones. The size of the pump further contributes to users being embarrassed by the pump. This complaint, along with concerns relating to how and where the pump can be utilized due to its size and shape, is frequently cited among users of traditional pumps. For current MDI users, the size of traditional pumps is often communicated as a reason for not adopting pump therapy. 
 
Difficult to learn and teach. Traditional pumps often rely on complicated and outdated technology and are not intuitive to operate. Our research has shown that it can take several days to competently learn how to use traditional pumps, leading to frustration, frequent mistakes and additional training, each of which may discourage adoption. We believe difficult-to-use traditional pumps result in a higher frequency of calls by the user to the pump manufacturer or their healthcare provider for support, adding both frustration and cost to the learning process. We also believe that the complicated functionality of traditional pumps significantly limits the willingness of healthcare providers to recommend insulin pump therapy to many patients, and limits the number of patients they consider as candidates for insulin pump therapy.
 
Complicated to use. Traditional pumps are designed with linear software menus, which require the user to follow display screens sequentially, limiting their ability to access information within workflows or easily return to the starting point. Most traditional pumps require users to scroll through numerous menus and input multiple commands to make selections. This process, which must be performed multiple times per day, can be frustrating and time-consuming. Our research has shown that the complicated nature of the process can lead to confusion, frustration and fear of making mistakes with the pump, which in turn can limit the user’s willingness to take advantage of advanced pump features, or even discourage use entirely. 
 
8

Pump mechanism limitations. Traditional pumps utilize a mechanism in which a lead screw drives a plunger to deliver insulin. This design limits the ability to reduce the size of the pump due to the length and diameter of the syringe and lead screw. 
 

Traditional Pump Mechanism 
 
We believe that these shortcomings of traditional pumps have limited the adoption of pump therapy. By addressing these issues, there is a meaningful opportunity to not only motivate MDI users to adopt pump therapy, but also to respond to the concerns and unmet needs of traditional insulin pump users thereby encouraging increased demand for our pumps. 
Our Solution 
 
We develop our insulin pump technology and related product offerings using a consumer-focused approach. We initially rely on extensive market research to ascertain what people with insulin-dependent diabetes require and prefer from their diabetes therapy. We then look to modern consumer technology for inspiration, and design our hardware and software solutions to meet those specific demands. Our development process then applies the science of human factors, which optimizes a device or system to the intended user through iterative usability and design refinement. This multi-step approach has resulted in products that provide users with the distinct features and functionality they seek and in a manner that makes the features usable and intuitive. We believe this approach is fundamentally different from the historical approach applied to the traditional medical device development process. All of our insulin pump products were developed using this customer-focused approach, as were our related product offerings, including the Tandem Device Updater, t:connect and t:lock. We expect to continue to utilize this approach as we develop new product offerings and innovations.
 
Our next generation flagship product, t:slim X2, which we believe addresses the shortcomings of currently available traditional pumps, features: 
 
Contemporary style. t:slim X2, as well as our products under development, has the look and feel of a modern consumer electronic device, such as a smartphone. Relying on extensive consumer input and feedback received during the development process, we believe the modern and innovative design of our products addresses the embarrassing appearance-related concerns of insulin pump users. Key product features such as a high-resolution, color touchscreen with shatter-resistant glass, aluminum casing and rechargeable battery, make t:slim X2 unique in the insulin pump market.

Our t:slim X2 Insulin Pump Form Factor (Actual Size) 
 
Adaptable platform. The t:slim X2 platform is highly adaptable as a result of a number of features that are inherent within our proprietary technology, including our easy-to-navigate software architecture and touchscreen user interface. t:slim X2 is also compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, which is a tool that allows pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. This tool uniquely positions us to bring new features and benefits, such as CGM integration or AID algorithms, to customers within their typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. We believe the adaptability of our pump platform uniquely positions us to address the needs and preferences of people with insulin-dependent diabetes, and to do so quickly as those needs and preferences change and the functionality of our products evolves.
 
Compact size. With a narrow profile, similar to many smartphones, t:slim X2 can easily and discreetly fit into a pocket. t:slim X2 is the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market, while still offering a cartridge with 300 units of insulin. More specifically, t:slim X2 is at least 25% smaller than all other durable insulin pumps available in the United States, and 38% smaller than the newest insulin pump form factor offered by one of our leading competitors. t:flex offers a similar sleek pump form factor, while utilizing a cartridge with 480 units of insulin, providing enhanced flexibility to people with greater insulin needs. The size and shape of our products are designed to provide increased flexibility with respect to how and where a pump can be worn. Based on extensive consumer input during development, we believe our products address both the embarrassment and functionality concerns related to the size and inconvenience of carrying a traditional pump. 
 

t:slim X2 Profile (Actual Size) 
 
Easy to learn and teach. Our technology platform allows for the use of a color touchscreen and easy-to-navigate software architecture, providing users intuitive access to the key functions of their pumps directly from the Home Screen. Insulin pump users can quickly learn how to efficiently navigate their pumps’ software, thereby enabling healthcare providers to spend less time teaching a person how to use the pump and more time improving management of their diabetes. We believe these features also allow healthcare providers to more efficiently train people to use our pump and have a higher degree of confidence that users can successfully operate our pump, including its more advanced features. Our touchscreen technology also allows us to offer our t:simulator App, which permits anyone to experience our easy-to-navigate software for any of our pumps free of charge on a mobile device. We believe the ease with which our pump can be learned and taught, and the accessibility of our t:simulator App that broadly demonstrates our software technology, will help attract consumers who may have been frustrated or intimidated by traditional pumps. 
 10



t:simulator App Accessible Through Mobile Device
 
Intuitive to use. Similar to what is found in modern consumer electronic devices, the embedded software displayed on our color touchscreen features intuitive and commonly interpreted colors, language, icons and feedback. Our software also features numerous shortcuts, including a simple way to return to the Home Screen and view critical information for therapy management. These features were designed to enable users to operate their pump more efficiently and with greater confidence, and to expand the set of therapy features they regularly utilize. Users can also execute most tasks in fewer steps than traditional pumps, which we believe further encourages people to use more advanced pump features. We believe these features also allow users to more efficiently manage their diabetes without fear or frustration.
Easy-to-Navigate Pump Software Architecture  
 
Innovative technology. Our Micro-Delivery technology is unique compared to traditional pumps. Its miniaturized pumping mechanism draws insulin from a flexible bag within the pump’s cartridge rather than relying on a mechanical syringe and lead screw mechanism. Our technology was tested under both typical and extreme operating conditions and is designed to last for at least the anticipated four-year warranty of the pump. Our technology allows us to reduce the size of the device as compared to traditional pumps, making t:slim X2 the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market. In addition, our technology is capable of delivering the smallest increment of insulin compared to any pump currently available, which allows insulin therapy to be individualized for each user.

Quick Access to Pump History 
 

Our Insulin Pump Mechanism 
 
Our insulin pumps feature a micro-USB connection that supports a rapid rechargeable battery and uploads to t:connect, both of which can be performed without disconnecting or interrupting insulin delivery. This connection also supports software updates through the Tandem Device Updater. 
 
We believe the t:slim X2 platform will allow us to further penetrate and expand the insulin pump therapy market by addressing the specific product and technology limitations associated with traditional pumps that have been raised by people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers. We also believe our technology under development provides us with the opportunity to address unmet needs in the insulin-dependent diabetes market, including advancements in AID and the potential for further device miniaturization. 
 
Our Strategy 
 
Our goal is to significantly expand and further penetrate the insulin-dependent diabetes market and become the leading provider of insulin pump therapy by focusing on both consumer and clinical needs. By continually conducting market research to determine what people with insulin-dependent diabetes and healthcare providers desire from insulin therapy, and offering an adaptable insulin pump that can provide features and functionality to respond to evolving needs and preferences, we believe we are uniquely positioned to address differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market. At the same time, by rapidly innovating and offering new product features and benefits through the t:slim X2 platform, and Tandem Device Updater, we are also able to leverage a single sales, marketing and clinical organization, a shared manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure, and the expertise of our customer support services. 
 
To achieve our goal, we intend to pursue the following business strategies:
 
12

Drive adoption of our products through our sales, marketing and clinical infrastructure. We have achieved commercial success by investing in the development of our sales, marketing and clinical infrastructure. With this base infrastructure, we believe we are well-positioned to introduce our products to more people with insulin-dependent diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers, while continuing to provide the highest level of customer service. For example, we are leveraging our infrastructure by marketing our new products, including t:slim X2 with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration, to primarily the same healthcare providers as our previous pump products, thereby increasing our efficiency. We are also leveraging our infrastructure to launch reusable supplies that utilize the t:lock, which has substantially increased our sales of infusion sets over the past year. We believe our early investments in this infrastructure, when combined with the launch and marketing of new products, will drive continued adoption of our products, while efficiently increasing our revenues over the long-term.
 
Promote awareness of our products to consumers, their caregivers and healthcare providers. Our products were specifically designed to address the shortcomings of currently available technologies that we believe have limited the adoption of insulin pump therapy. We intend to continue our direct-to-consumer marketing to promote the insulin therapy features and functionalities offered by our products through our website, the use of social media and online advertising tools, our t:simulator App and motivational spokespeople at industry forums and events. We also expect to leverage our sales and marketing force, together with our clinical specialists, to cultivate relationships with diabetes clinics, insulin-prescribing healthcare professionals and other key opinion leaders. By promoting awareness of our products, we believe we will be able to attract users of our competitors’ insulin pump products, as well other pump therapies and MDI, to our products.
 
Advance our clinical activities to further demonstrate that use of our pump products may contribute to improved clinical outcomes. Data analyzed from t:connect suggests that use of our pump products may provide users with improved clinical outcomes. For example, in a recent study, we compared retrospective user data from our t:slim G4 SAP and a leading competitor’s SAP. Our SAP demonstrated statistically significant clinical advantages, including reduced hypoglycemia, increased time in range, and improved overall glycemic control, despite approximately half of our competitors’ SAP users actively using a feature that suspends insulin delivery if blood glucose levels fall below a preset threshold. This study suggests that our simple-to-use touchscreen interface may translate to improved clinical outcomes for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Another recent study demonstrated a reduced risk of hypoglycemia associated with use of our pumps compared to other methods of diabetes therapy, as well as a statistically significant reduction in ambulance rides due to severe hypoglycemia and in days spent at the hospital due to severe hypoglycemia. In addition, we are actively involved in multiple clinical trials supporting the use of our AID products in development, which were designed to demonstrate the clinical benefits associated with these products. We plan to continue to invest in clinical activities intended to demonstrate that the use of our products contributes to improved clinical outcomes. 
 
Continue to innovate to provide products that address the unmet needs of people in the insulin-dependent diabetes market. We believe the t:slim X2 platform allows us to provide the most sophisticated and intuitive insulin pump therapy on the market. In addition, our Tandem Device Updater is designed to allow pump users to quickly and easily update their pump’s software from a personal computer. We successfully demonstrated the utility of this tool in the third quarter of 2017 when, following FDA approval, we simultaneously offered Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration to both existing and new t:slim X2 users. Subject to obtaining future FDA approvals, we intend to leverage the t:slim X2 platform to allow users to update their pumps’ software to include AID algorithms, which also eliminates the need for disruptive and costly trade-in programs to upgrade hardware to newer platforms. We also intend to leverage the t:slim X2 platform to continue to pursue advances in AID, including through strategic agreements and commercial product development efforts. As examples of these efforts, we have entered into development agreements with Dexcom to allow the integration of our insulin pumps with Dexcom’s CGM systems, and a license agreement with TypeZero Technologies, LLC, or TypeZero, to allow the integration of TypeZero’s inControl AID algorithms. In addition, we intend to continue to explore additional features, functionality and mobile applications for the t:slim X2 platform, as well as a next generation pump platform, in order to address differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.

Invest in our consumer-focused approach. We believe our consumer-focused approach to product design, marketing and customer care is a key differentiator. Our extensive market research involving people with diabetes, their caregivers and healthcare providers has driven the design and development of our products and customer care model. This approach allows us to add the product features most requested by people with insulin-dependent diabetes, thereby affording the consumer the opportunity to more efficiently manage their diabetes. We will continue to apply the science of human factors throughout the design, development and continuous improvement of our products to optimize our products for intended users. We will continue to invest in our consumer-focused approach throughout our business.

Broaden direct access to third-party payor reimbursement for our products in the United States. We believe third-party reimbursement is an important determinant in driving consumer adoption of insulin pump therapy. We also believe customer and healthcare provider interest in our products is an important factor that enhances our prospect of contracting with third-party payors. We intend to intensify our efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish direct reimbursement for our products as we expand our market presence and product offerings. We also plan to participate in clinical studies to demonstrate the benefits of our products relative to other pump products and therapies as a way to gain support from third-party payors.
 
Leverage our manufacturing operations to achieve cost and production efficiencies. We manufacture our products at our facilities located in San Diego, California. We utilize a semi-automated manufacturing process for our pump products and disposable cartridges. We have significantly increased our manufacturing output since we began commercialization of our products. During 2017, we relocated our manufacturing operations to our new, 50,000 square foot Barnes Canyon facility, which became fully operational at the beginning of 2018. This facility doubles our previous manufacturing capacity for both insulin pumps and cartridges and expands warehousing for additional infusion set supplies related to the launch of our t:lock. The facility is also designed to maximize efficiencies in our manufacturing processes and workflows, and allow us to further expand our production capacity by replicating our production lines, without significantly increasing the cost of overhead from our facilities. As demand for our products increases, we intend to drive operational efficiencies by leveraging our manufacturing infrastructure, which we expect will result in improvements in gross margin over the long-term. In addition, because the t:slim X2 platform is highly adaptable and can provide new features and functionality through remote software updates, our current systems will not need to change to support new features as they are approved by the FDA, which we expect will create additional manufacturing efficiencies.
 
Our Technology Platform 
 
We have developed an innovative technology platform that we believe is fundamental to the ease-of-use and functionality of t:slim X2, and will provide the foundation for the development of our future products. The key elements of our current technology platform are: 
 
Advanced core technology. Our patented Micro-Delivery technology is unique compared to traditional pumps. Our miniaturized pumping mechanism allows us to reduce the size of the pump as compared to traditional pumps. Reducing the size of the pumping mechanism also allows us to support various insulin cartridge capacities. It was designed to provide precise dosing as frequently as every five minutes and in increments as small as 0.001 u/hr, or units per hour, as compared to the smallest increment available in traditional pumps, which is 0.025 u/hr. This technology also helps prevent unintentional insulin delivery by limiting the volume of insulin that can be delivered to a person at any one time. 
 
Easy-to-navigate embedded software architecture. Our technology platform was developed using an iterative human factors design process that results in the intuitive software architecture which features commonly interpreted colors, language, icons and feedback. This allows the user to easily navigate the system and perform necessary functions in fewer steps than traditional pumps, including a one-touch method to return to the Home Screen. Our intuitive software architecture is designed to facilitate ease of learning, teaching and use. The flexible software architecture also facilitates updates to the software through the Tandem Device Updater without requiring any hardware changes.
 
Vivid color touchscreen. Our full color touchscreen allows users to access a streamlined, easy-to-use interface that promotes user confidence. The high-grade, shatter-resistant glass touchscreen provides the user the ability to enter numbers and access features directly, rather than scrolling through numerous screens and options. The touchscreen facilitates safety features that were designed to prevent unintended pump operations. The touchscreen also supports enhanced visual and tactile feedback. 
 
Lithium-polymer rechargeable battery technology. Our products are the first and only insulin pumps to use a rechargeable battery, unlike traditional pumps that rely on expensive disposable batteries. By using a built-in rechargeable battery, we eliminate the risk of losing personal settings associated with replacing batteries. Our lithium-polymer rechargeable battery charges rapidly with a standard micro-USB connection, and a full charge lasts for five to seven days depending on CGM use. Users report that they keep their battery powered by charging it for just 10 to 15 minutes each day, often while showering or commuting with the use of the car charger we provide with the pump. Our battery allows for accessible monitoring of the current charge level on the device’s Home Screen. Our battery has also been tested to last for at least the four-year warranty life of the pump. 
 
14

Compatibility and connectivity. Our PC- and Mac-compatible, cloud-based data management application, t:connect, provides our insulin pump users a fast, easy and visual way to display therapy management data from all of our pump products and supported blood glucose meters. Our platform empowers people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, to quickly and easily identify meaningful insights and trends, allowing them to fine-tune therapy and lifestyle choices for better control of their diabetes. Additionally, our platform enables rapid data uploads through a micro-USB connection, without interrupting insulin delivery.
 
Our Products 
 
We have commercially launched five insulin pumps since inception, all of which have been developed using our proprietary technology platform. We began commercial sales of our first insulin pump, t:slim, in 2012. During 2015, we commenced commercial sales of t:flex and t:slim G4. In 2016, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 and discontinued new sales of t:slim. In September 2017, we commenced commercial sales of t:slim X2 integrated with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system and discontinued new sales of t:slim G4. 
 
Commercial Products
 
Our Insulin Pump Products
 
Since the launch of our first product in August 2012, through December 2017, we have shipped nearly 68,000 pumps to customers in the United States. Today, our commercial efforts primarily focus on the manufacturing and sale of t:slim X2, although we continue to offer t:flex for people with greater insulin needs. Our insulin pumps feature a vivid, full color touchscreen made of high-grade, shatter-resistant glass that provides users the ability to enter numbers and access features directly, rather than scrolling through a list of numbers and screens. We designed the streamlined, user-friendly interface of our products to facilitate rapid access to the features people use most, such as delivering a bolus, viewing remaining insulin on board, viewing insulin cartridge volume and monitoring current pump status and settings. The interface also includes an Options Menu that provides quick and intuitive navigation to key insulin management features, pump settings, cartridge loading and use history. Our insulin pumps also feature a Home Screen button that immediately returns the user to the Home Screen where important administrative features are displayed, including the current battery charge level, a time and date display, and an LED indicator for alerts, alarms and reminders. 
 
In addition, our insulin pumps allow for the creation of multiple customizable Personal Profiles, each supporting up to 16 timed insulin delivery settings. This feature allows users to manage their day-to-day insulin therapy with less effort and interruption. Users can quickly and easily adjust insulin settings based on a number of key factors, including basal rate, correction factor, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and target blood glucose levels. 
 
Furthermore, our insulin pumps share important common features, including a black aluminum case and chrome trim, that give them the look and feel of a modern consumer electronic device, such as a smartphone. Our insulin pumps are also watertight, with an IPX7 rating, eliminating concerns about accidentally getting it wet. Each device also features a micro-USB connection that supports charging the lithium-polymer battery, software updates through the Tandem Device Updater, and rapid data uploads to t:connect.
 
t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System 
 
Our next-generation flagship product, the t:slim X2 Insulin Delivery System, is comprised of a t:slim X2 pump, its 300-unit disposable insulin cartridge and an infusion set. We began commercial sales of t:slim X2 in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2016. Measuring 2.0 x 3.1 x 0.6 inches, t:slim X2 is the slimmest and smallest durable insulin pump on the market. t:slim X2 features new hardware advancements, including a two-way Bluetooth wireless technology radio for communicating with more than one external device at a time. 
 
15

300-unit Insulin Cartridge being inserted into t:slim X2 Pump 
 
We have a development and commercialization agreement with Dexcom, which provides us a non-exclusive license to integrate our product platform with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM System. CGM is a therapy that provides users with real-time access to their glucose levels as well as trend information. Following approval by the FDA, we began offering Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration on the t:slim X2 platform, or t:slim with G5, in the third quarter of 2017, at which point we ceased sales of t:slim G4. t:slim X2 with G5 incorporates the same pump technology and user interface as t:slim X2, but also provides the added convenience of allowing CGM information to be displayed on the pump, thereby eliminating the need to carry an additional device. Based on this information, users are able to utilize the pump to take direct action with their insulin pump therapy. 
 
t:slim X2 with G5 is the only insulin pump available with Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration and is the first SAP approved to let users make treatment decisions without pricking their finger. We believe that these advancements, together with future anticipated applications of the Tandem Device Updater, have the potential to enable users to add new features and functionality, such as AID algorithms, to their pumps independent of their typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. 
 
t:flex Insulin Delivery System 
 
The t:flex Insulin Delivery System is comprised of a t:flex pump, its 480-unit disposable insulin cartridge and an infusion set. We began commercial sales of t:flex in the United States in the second quarter of 2015. 
t:flex Insulin Pump 
 
16

People with insulin-dependent diabetes require different amounts of insulin based on their level of insulin sensitivity, which can vary significantly from person to person. t:flex is designed for individuals who require more than 100 units of U-100 insulin per day on MDI or more than 80 units per day using a pump, such as teenagers with type 1 diabetes and many people with type 2 diabetes. t:flex incorporates the same technology platform as the original t:slim, but offers a 480-unit insulin reservoir, the largest capacity currently approved in the United States. This provides users the benefits of pump therapy without the frequent cartridge changes required by 200- and 300-unit capacity pumps. The insulin cartridge used in t:flex extends out slightly on one side to accommodate the extra volume while maintaining all of the other benefits of t:slim, including its slim and sleek appearance. 
 
In our market research, two-thirds of endocrinologists cited limited volume capacity as the number one barrier to pump adoption for their patients with type 2 diabetes who use daily rapid-acting insulin. Our research also has shown that the appearance and bulky size of traditional pumps is a deterrent to pump adoption for people with greater insulin needs We believe that offering a 480-unit cartridge, combined with the other features and benefits offered by our technology platform, addresses many of the common barriers to pump therapy for a person with type 2 diabetes who is insulin-dependent.
 
Our Complementary Products
 
Tandem Device Updater
 
Our insulin pumps are compatible with the Tandem Device Updater, a revolutionary new tool that allows pump users to update their pumps’ software quickly and easily from a personal computer. The Tandem Device Updater was cleared by the FDA in the third quarter of 2016 and is PC- and Mac- compatible. It works with our insulin pumps in a manner similar to software updates on a smartphone. Because remote updatability for insulin pump software is a unique feature not available in competitive pump offerings, the Tandem Device Updater provides our customers with the capability to access new and enhanced features and functionality faster than the industry has been able to in the past. We are uniquely positioned to offer this capability due to the intuitive software architecture and convenient micro-USB connection included within our pump products. 
 
The first use of our Tandem Device Updater was for deployment of the latest t:slim software to in-warranty t:slim pumps purchased before April 2015. In September 2017, we set a new standard of care in our industry by offering all existing t:slim X2 customers integration with the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM system through a software update using the Tandem Device Updater. Within the first 30 days following the FDA approval of this update, more than 30% of t:slim X2 customers who purchased their pump prior to its availability had updated their pump. By the end of 2017 more than 40% of t:slim X2 customers had updated their pump and now have access to Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM integration. 
 
In October 2017, we announced that, subject to FDA approval, we intend to make any new features approved by the FDA in 2018 available to all in-warranty users of t:slim X2 at no cost through the Tandem Device Updater. In the future, this tool has the potential to enable users to add other new features and functionality to their pumps, such as AID algorithms, independent of the typical four-year insurance pump replacement cycle. We expect that future software upgrades will be implemented through our Tandem Device Updater as we obtain regulatory approval for their commercialization.
 
t:connect Diabetes Management Application 
 
We commercially introduced the t:connect Diabetes Management Application, or t:connect, our cloud-based data management application, in the first quarter of 2013. It provides users, their caregivers and their healthcare providers a fast, easy and visual way to display therapy management data from our pumps and supported blood glucose meters. This application empowers people with diabetes, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers, to quickly and easily identify meaningful insights and trends, allowing them to refine therapy and lifestyle choices for better management of their diabetes. It also provides us with valuable data that we can analyze computationally to reveal patterns, trends and associations that can be used in continuous product improvements, and identification of clinical outcomes data for marketing purposes and third-party payors. We also believe t:connect can serve as a key component of mobile health applications that are currently under development. 
 
17

We developed t:connect to be intuitive by using the same consumer-focused approach utilized in the development of our insulin pumps. It features built-in smart logic that manages duplicate blood glucose readings from a user’s pump and blood glucose meter to ensure report accuracy. t:connect can also generate color-coded graphs and interactive, multi-dimensional reports that make it easy to identify therapy management trends, problems and successes. While our insulin pumps hold the data generated over a period of up to 90 days, once a user uploads their therapy management information to t:connect, the information is retained in their account. t:connect maintains the highest standards of patient data privacy and is hosted on secure servers that are compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. 
 
In 2017, we launched an enhanced version of t:connect that we expect will simplify the ability of pump users to share t:connect data with their healthcare providers, which we refer to as t:connect HCP. This application allows a healthcare provider to establish a separate account that centralizes t:connect data from all of their enrolled patients.
 

t:connect Diabetes Management Application 
 
Infusion Sets
 
In September 2017, we began replacing the standard Luer-lok connector that previously joined an infusion set to our cartridge with a custom connector, the t:lock Connector. Our t:lock was designed to address the most requested improvement to our products that we have received from customers. It is similar in its design to that of a standard Luer connector, but on average, reduces the time required to fill tubing by more than 30 seconds and reduces the amount of insulin used in the process by 4.5 units. It also reduces the possibility of air bubbles being trapped in the connector. We are offering our customers the same choice in infusion set configurations as they were able to purchase from us previously, but with the added benefits associated with our t:lock. We continue to offer both the original Luer-lok connector and our t:lock concurrently for a period of time to facilitate the transition, and by the end of 2017 our infusion sets and cartridges were being sold on a one-to-one basis. The transition to our t:lock resulted in a substantial increase in our sales of infusion sets in 2017, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, which we anticipate will continue in 2018. We intend to continue to invest in the development of enhancements to our infusion set products to address the perceived shortcomings of existing products on the market.
Pump Accessories
 
We offer our customers a broad range of accessories for their pumps, allowing users to customize their device to their individual lifestyle and sense of style. We believe our accessories increase user flexibility and willingness to use and carry their insulin pump. 
Products under Development 
 
Our products under development support our strategy of focusing on both consumer and clinical needs, and include: AID systems, a next-generation hardware platform, and connected (mobile) health offerings. We intend to leverage our consumer-focused approach and proprietary technology platform to continue to develop products that have the features and functionalities that will allow us to meet the needs of people in differentiated segments of the insulin-dependent diabetes market.

Automated Insulin Delivery Systems
 
An AID system generally involves an external device, or combination of devices, intended to aid a person with insulin-dependent diabetes by automatically testing and controlling their blood glucose through the administration of insulin by itself or in combination with a second hormone. This may be achievable by combining an insulin pump and a CGM with computer software that allows the two devices to automatically communicate to determine and provide the right amount of insulin, or insulin plus another hormone, at the correct time. 
 
We have supported leading researchers at facilities such as the University of Virginia, Boston University, Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University by providing pump hardware and software to advance development of AID solutions. More recently, we commenced clinical trials of our own products under development with embedded AID systems. 
 
t:slim X2 with Basal IQ

The t:slim X2 with Basal IQ is designed to utilize Dexcom G5 sensor values to adjust the rate of insulin delivery to help minimize the frequency and/or duration of hypoglycemic events. The algorithm was developed internally in consultation with clinical thought leaders in AID research. In our market research, a predictive low glucose suspend, or PLGS, algorithm was reported as the most valuable AID feature among people with insulin-dependent diabetes and their healthcare providers. 
 
t:slim X2 with Basal IQ
 
We previously referred to this system under its development name, the t:slim X2 with PLGS and, following FDA approval, intend to market this product under the name t:slim X2 with Basal IQ. During 2016, we completed a feasibility study of our PLGS algorithm. The data from this feasibility study was used in an IDE submission for a pivotal study, which was approved by the FDA in May 2017. We completed a pivotal study for our t:slim X2 with Basal IQ in January 2018. Results from this study showed that the system achieved the primary outcome of reducing time spent in hypoglycemia compared to SAP therapy alone. This reduction was accomplished without any increase in the rate of hyperglycemia. Study participants reported that the system was easy to use and also reported a high level of confidence using the system. The results of the pivotal study were used in our PMA that was submitted to the FDA in late February 2018. Subject to future FDA approval, our goal is to launch the t:slim X2 with Basal IQ in the summer of 2018.
 
t:slim X2 with Control IQ
 
Our second generation AID system is expected to integrate the t:slim X2 pump with a combination of Dexcom’s G6 sensor and AID technology that we licensed from TypeZero. TypeZero’s technology includes a series of algorithms developed from research initially conducted at the University of Virginia. To date, this technology has been used in more than 30 clinical studies including more than 450 participants and the data has been referenced in a number of journal articles. 
 
We previously referred to this system under its development name, the t:slim X2 with TypeZero and, following FDA approval, intend to market the product under the name t:slim X2 with Control IQ. This hybrid closed loop product will be differentiated from competing products, as we expect it will provide automated correction boluses, which we believe will bring additional benefits to our customers. In our market research, people with insulin-dependent diabetes and their healthcare providers reported a strong preference for t:slim X2 with Control IQ as compared to a competitive AID system.
 19

t:slim X2 with Control IQ
 

In November 2016, we announced that we are working with Dexcom and TypeZero on the integration of our technologies into the IDCL Trial. We anticipate that a portion of the trial will utilize a t:slim X2 integrated with TypeZero’s inControl AID algorithms, which is designed to automatically adjust a person’s insulin based on information received from a Dexcom G6 sensor. We intend to use the results from this portion of the trial in a PMA submission with the FDA. We also anticipate conducting one or more targeted pediatric studies in a summer or winter camp setting for a future regulatory submission. Subject to both the timely completion of the IDCL Trial with a satisfactory outcome and future FDA approval, our goal is to launch this product in the first half of 2019.
 
t:sport Insulin Delivery System: Our Next-generation Hardware Platform
 
Our next generation hardware platform is referred to under its development name, the t:sport Insulin Delivery System, or t:sport. This product is expected to be half the size of t:slim and is being designed for people who seek even greater discretion and flexibility with the use of their insulin pump. We anticipate that t:sport will feature a low-cost 200-unit cartridge, an on-pump bolus button, a rechargeable battery, an AID algorithm, and a Bluetooth radio. t:sport is being designed for use with leading U-100 insulins, and in 2018 we plan to conduct research on the use of insulin concentrates to provide people with greater insulin needs an alternative to t:flex. We are also evaluating offering a 300-unit cartridge alternative. We anticipate that t:sport will utilize a pumping mechanism that differs from our current Micro-Delivery technology and will be controlled through a separate controller or mobile device application. 
 
t:sport Shown with Touchscreen Controller
 
20

In 2016, we began discussions with the FDA regarding whether the t:sport controller can be implemented as a mobile device application or will need to be a separate device. Based on the FDA’s feedback regarding the use of unrestricted mobile phones, we believe that controlling a pump via an unrestricted mobile device will be a longer path to market, and as a result, we are designing the product so that it will have the technical capability to be controlled using either a dedicated controller or a mobile device. Because of the nature of our touchscreen user interface, we are well positioned to pursue either option.
 
We anticipate conducting clinical trials in 2019 and our goal is to launch this product in 2020 or 2021. 
 
Connected (Mobile) Health Offerings
 
We are currently developing a mobile application designed to utilize the capability of the Bluetooth radio, which is already built into our pumps, to wirelessly upload pump data to t:connect, receive notification of pump alerts and alarms, integrate other health-related information from third party sources, and support future pump-control capabilities for our products under development. We intend to launch the first generation of our mobile application in mid-2018, with a subset of these features.

21

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 70 territories in our U.S. sales organization, with approximately 200 full-time employees on our sales, clinical and marketing team. The vast majority of territories are supported by a territory manager and a clinical diabetes specialist who, as a team, call on endocrinologists, nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, certified diabetes educators and potential customers. Where appropriate, some territories are supported by multiple clinical diabetes specialists. Our sales team is augmented by individuals in our internal customer sales support organization, who follow up on leads generated through promotional activities and educate people on the benefits of our proprietary technology and products. 
 
Our internal San Diego-based customer sales support organization also contacts existing customers who are approaching their insurance renewal date to aid in the renewal process. Our goal is for at least 70% of our existing customers to purchase a new pump from us when making a new pump purchasing decision. Typically, customers are eligible for insurance reimbursement to purchase a new insulin pump once every four years, however some plans may be limited to once every five years or have additional restrictions or requirements. 2017 was our first full year with customers eligible for renewal. Trend data suggests that we will achieve our renewal rate goal in the longer term, based on renewal purchases by our earliest customers. However, factors such as the timing of competitive product launches, regulatory approvals, advancements in diabetes therapy alternatives, and other market dynamics may impact the rate of renewal purchases.
 
As our market penetration continues to build momentum, and as we launch new products into the market, we may consider further expanding our sales, clinical and marketing infrastructure in the United States; however, no territory expansions are anticipated in 2018. We plan to begin commercialization of t:slim X2 outside the United States in select geographies, including Canada, during 2018. Unlike our approach domestically, with the exception of Canada, we currently plan to partner with distributors who will carry out the selling efforts, as well as the service and support of customers in geographies outside the United States. Currently, we anticipate having a direct sales and clinical infrastructure in Canada beginning in 2018, with customer support and services shared with our domestic organization. We may also elect to partner with distributors in Canada as needed.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we made sales to approximately 35 independent distributors in the United States, with sales to Edgepark Medical Supplies, Inc. and Byram Healthcare accounting for 21.5% and 14.0% of our sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Edgepark Medical Supplies, Inc. and Byram Healthcare accounted for 18.7% and 14.0% of our sales, respectively. None of our independent distributors in the United States are required to sell our products exclusively and each of them may freely sell the products of our competitors. Our distributor agreements in the United States generally have one-year initial terms with automatic one-year renewal terms, and are terminable in connection with a party’s material breach. 
 
Healthcare provider focused initiatives. Healthcare providers are a critical resource in helping patients understand and select their diabetes therapy options. Each of our territories is supported by a clinical diabetes specialist who is a certified diabetes educator and holds either a registered nurse or registered dietician license. Our clinical diabetes specialists support and educate healthcare providers on our products and proprietary technology, certify healthcare providers to train people to use our products and support our customers with initial training following the purchase of our products. 
 
In addition to calling on healthcare providers in their offices, some of our recent marketing initiatives include: 
 
 
● | presentations and product demonstrations at local, regional, national and international tradeshows, including the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions and the American Association of Diabetes Educators Annual Meeting;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our Demonstration Unit Program, through which we provide healthcare professionals with our products, or a mobile device that operates our t:simulator App, for pump demonstrations to their patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | partnerships with third-party diabetes management systems for the display of Tandem pump data, including diasend Clinic and Tidepool.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Consumer-focused initiatives. We sell our products directly to consumers through referrals from healthcare providers and through leads generated through our promotional activities. Our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts focus on positioning our products as innovative, consumer-focused insulin pumps with a unique Micro-Delivery technology, slim touchscreen design, and an intuitive user interface designed to meet different needs in the diabetes community. In connection with the launch of t:slim X2 with G5, our marketing also emphasizes the greater accuracy of the Dexcom G5 Mobile CGM over competitive products. Some of our recent consumer-focused marketing initiatives include:
 
22

 
● | participation at consumer-focused regional diabetes conferences and events including the JDRF Type One Nation Summits, the American Diabetes Association Expos, Children With Diabetes Friends for Life and Taking Control Of Your Diabetes, or TCOYD, conferences and local diabetes camps;

--+-----------------------------------------------------

 
Branding. We developed our comprehensive branding strategy to engage consumers and communicate our identity as a modern and progressive company that works “in tandem” with the diabetes community, healthcare providers, our employees and business partners. We strive to embody this through our product offerings, marketing efforts and interactions throughout our business. Our product names are consistently branded using a “t:” to create uniformity and help consumers quickly identify our products. Our “touch simplicity” marketing campaign highlights the slim touchscreen design and easy-to-navigate software associated with our pump products. Our other product packaging, website, advertising and promotional materials are a reflection of our consumer-focused approach and modern style. We value having clear, friendly and helpful communications throughout our business. 
 
Animas will Discontinue the Manufacture and Sale of Insulin Pumps
 
In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced that it intends to discontinue the operations of Animas, and exit the insulin pump business entirely, and, in connection with these activities, designated Medtronic as a preferred partner to facilitate the transition of Animas insulin pump customers. As part of this transition, Medtronic is offering a portion of Animas customers the option of acquiring a prior-generation Medtronic insulin pump, the 630G, at no charge. As a result of this change in the insulin pump market, we now offer the only alternative durable insulin pump to Medtronic in the United States. While this announcement represents a significant change within our industry, it is too early to know how it will influence our business or the competitive landscape in which we operate over the longer term. More recently, in the fourth quarter of 2017 we experienced an increase in our percentage of sales to people who reported switching from using an Animas pump. However, the largest percentage of our new customers still report being new to pump therapy, with approximately half converting from MDI, followed by customers who reported converting from either a Medtronic or Animas pump. The potential impact on our business of this announcement is uncertain, although we expect it may be dependent on one or more of the following factors: 
 
 
• | The offer to Animas customers for a free Medtronic 630G pump is currently limited to customers with a warranty expiration date later than September 30, 2019, and the offer is not available until May 2018. It remains uncertain how many Animas customers will avail themselves of this offer.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | While Medtronic will have direct access to all Animas customers during the transition period, as those customers' pumps come up for renewal and they make new pump purchasing decisions, they may consider alternative pump options. According to recent surveys from dQ&A, when making renewal decisions, Animas customers have historically chosen their pump or a Tandem pump rather than a Medtronic offering. Recent surveys from dQ&A have also shown that only 9% of patients acquiring a Medtronic pump during the past six quarters were previous Animas customers, and 79% of new purchasers of Medtronic pumps were customers who upgraded from a current Medtronic pump rather than switching from an alternative brand. For these reasons, and based on our own customer data that shows a high number of customers switching to our products from an Animas pump, we believe our pumps are an attractive alternative to both Animas and Medtronic pumps.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe one of the product features that has made Animas pumps attractive to their customers is the integration of the Animas Vibe with Dexcom’s CGM technology. We now provide the only commercially available pump that is integrated with Dexcom’s technology.

Training and Customer Care 
 
Given the chronic nature of diabetes, and the potentially complicated dynamic of health insurance coverage, training and customer care is important for developing long-term relationships with our customers. Our customer care infrastructure consists of individuals focused on training, technical services and insurance verification. We believe our consumer-focused approach enables us to develop a personal relationship with the customer, or potential customer, beginning with the process of evaluating our products, then navigating insurance coverage and extending to our provision of training and ongoing support. Providing reliable and effective ongoing customer support reduces anxiety, improves our customers’ overall experiences with our products and helps reinforce our positive reputation in the diabetes community. In order to provide complete training and customer care solutions, we leverage the expertise of our clinical diabetes specialists who provide one-on-one training, and we offer ongoing complementary technical services, as well as ongoing support with insurance verification. 
Training. Our research has shown that it can take several days for a user to competently learn how to use a traditional pump, leading to frustration, frequent mistakes and additional training, each of which may ultimately discourage adoption. As a result, we believe that healthcare providers may be less likely to recommend pump therapy to potential candidates. 
 
By offering an intuitive user interface, we believe healthcare providers will be able to train people to use our products more efficiently than traditional pumps, and will have a higher degree of confidence in their patients’ ability to operate it, including the more advanced features. In addition, the intuitive nature of our pump products likely will allow healthcare providers to spend less time teaching a person how to use their pump and more time helping to improve the management of their diabetes. This ease of training may also help users feel less intimidated and fearful of pump therapy, leading to increased adoption and market expansion. 
 
We tailor our training efforts for insulin pump users and healthcare providers. In some cases, our clinical training managers may certify clinic-based healthcare providers to train their patients on our products. In other cases, a member of our clinical team will conduct one-on-one training on our products with the customer. We have also established a network of independent, licensed diabetes educators who have been certified to train on our products and will conduct customer training on our behalf.
 
For our customers who purchased t:slim X2 with G5, we offer online training on the use of the CGM components of the system. Customers can access one or more modules of the training system at their own pace and at their preferred location, which offers them a convenient method to access the latest training available. We anticipate using similar online training modules for t:slim X2 with Basal IQ. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we presented research demonstrating the ease-of-use and effectiveness of computer-based training from the human factors study for t:slim X2 with Basal IQ. The study demonstrated a 99% success rate among study participants who performed a series of critical tasks using the system after initial training. Out of 530 tasks performed, only seven task failures were observed, none of which related to safety. In addition, participants in our t:slim X2 with Basal IQ pivotal study reported that the system is easy to use and also reported a high level of confidence using the system. We believe the ease of training on our AID systems will be a competitive advantage compared to currently-available AID systems.
 
Technical Services. We believe that a difficult-to-use pump will result in users making more frequent calls to the pump manufacturer or their healthcare provider for support in using the device. This can be frustrating for the customer and costly for the pump manufacturer as well as for the healthcare provider. In general, we expect the intuitive nature of our products to result in fewer calls from users requesting support from our technical services team or their healthcare provider. However, because of the significant percentage of our customers who are new to pump therapy, we also anticipate receiving high call volume from customers who are still becoming familiar with the fundamentals of insulin pump therapy. In addition, we have experienced increases to our call volume as our existing customers begin to utilize CGM integration with their t:slim X2, and we may see similar trends as we launch our new AID systems in the future. 
 
Our customer-focused technical services team provides support seven days a week, 24 hours a day by answering questions, troubleshooting and addressing issues or concerns for both the pump and CGM components of our systems. Our insulin pump products are typically covered by a four-year warranty. The warranty includes our product replacement program, which allows our technical services team members to provide a customer with a replacement device within as little as 24 hours, to minimize the interruption of his or her therapy. We also coordinate product replacements of CGM components where appropriate.
 
24

Insurance Verification. Our insurance verification team provides support to help customers, and potential customers, understand their insurance benefits. We work with the customers and their healthcare providers to collect information required by the insurance provider and to determine their insurance benefit coverage for our products and notify them of their benefit. 
 
Following communication of a person’s estimated financial responsibility, final confirmation of their desire to purchase the device and method of fulfillment, the customer’s order is typically shipped to their home. The initial order generally contains their insulin pump as well as a 90-day supply of infusion sets and cartridges. For customers that we service on a direct basis, a member of our internal team then contacts the customer prior to the end of their 90-day supply to re-verify their insurance benefits and assist in reordering supplies. For customers who purchase our insulin pump through one of our authorized distributors, ongoing supplies are typically also arranged through the distributor.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement 
 
Customer orders are typically fulfilled by billing third-party payors on behalf of our customers, or by utilizing our network of distributors who then bill third-party payors on our customers’ behalf. Our fulfillment and reimbursement systems are fully integrated such that our products are shipped only after receipt of a valid physician’s order and verification of current health insurance information. 
 
We are accredited by the Community Health Accreditation Program and are an approved Medicare provider. We currently bill for all of our insulin pump products and associated supplies using existing Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes for which Medicare reimbursement is well established. However, pump eligibility criteria for people with type 2 diabetes can be different and often requires additional documentation and laboratory testing to gain in-network insurance reimbursement benefits.
 
Over the last ten years, Medicare reimbursement rates for insulin pumps and disposable cartridges have remained relatively unchanged. However, Medicare periodically reviews its reimbursement practices for diabetes-related products. Medicare implemented a competitive bidding process for blood glucose strip reimbursement, which resulted in a significant reduction in the reimbursement rate for those products. More recently, in 2017, Medicare announced, and then shortly thereafter suspended, a competitive bidding process for insulin pumps. As a result, there is some uncertainty as to the future Medicare reimbursement rate for our current and future products. 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had entered into commercial contracts with approximately 176 national and regional third-party payors to establish reimbursement for our insulin pump products, disposable cartridges and other related supplies. We employ a team of managed care managers who are responsible for negotiating and securing contracts with third-party payors throughout the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 25% of our sales were generated through our direct third-party payor contracts.
 
If we are not contracted with a person’s third-party payor and in-network status cannot be otherwise obtained, then to the extent possible we utilize distribution channels so our customers’ orders can be serviced. As of December 31, 2017, we had executed distributor agreements with approximately 35 independent distributors. In some cases, but not all, this network of distributors allows us to access people who are covered by commercial payors with whom we are not contracted, at in-network rates that are generally more affordable for our customers. However, effective July 1, 2016, UnitedHealthcare designated one of our competitors as their preferred, in-network durable medical equipment provider of insulin pumps for most customers over the age of 18. We expect this decision will prevent a majority of UnitedHealthcare members from purchasing our insulin pump for the foreseeable future, whether directly from us or through our network of distributors.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 
 
We currently manufacture our products at our facilities in San Diego, California. In 2017, we transitioned our manufacturing operations to a new facility located on Barnes Canyon Road in San Diego, California, which became fully operational at the beginning of 2018. We expect this facility will double our manufacturing capacity for insulin pumps and cartridges, provide additional production capacity for new products under development and expand warehousing for additional infusion set supplies related to the launch of our t:lock, without significantly increasing the cost of overhead associated with our manufacturing facilities. 
 25


The Barnes Canyon facility is designed to optimize our manufacturing processes and allow for greater operational efficiencies, which we believe positions us well to achieve our long-term gross margin targets. By maintaining close proximity to our other business functions, we believe we will enhance our ability to monitor and manage our manufacturing processes, and to adjust manufacturing operations quickly in response to our business needs. The transition to the new manufacturing facility took place primarily in the second half of 2017, during which time we experienced some temporary duplication of operations to support ongoing product requirements, as well as some incremental manufacturing costs. In 2018, we do not expect significant capital expenditures in our manufacturing operations. 
 
Site inspections of the Barnes Canyon facility by the FDA and the California State Food and Drug Branch were completed in 2017. Following the FDA inspection, we received a Form 483, List of Inspectional Observations, containing two observations. Following our receipt of the Form 483, we began implementing corrective and preventive actions to fully address the FDA observations, and in October 2017, we provided a written response to the FDA. In December 2017, we received a letter from the FDA stating that our initial written response did not fully address the FDA observations, and that the FDA would review the observations during its next regularly scheduled inspection of our facilities. It is possible that the FDA will conclude that our corrective and preventive actions are inadequate.
 
We currently utilize a semi-automated manufacturing process for our pump products and disposable cartridges. The pump production line requires approximately 20 manufacturing assemblers and limited support staff to run the line, and reaches a maximum output of approximately 30,000 pumps per year on a single shift. Disposable cartridges are manufactured on a production line that requires 12 manufacturing operators and limited support staff, and reaches a maximum output of approximately 1.0 million cartridges per year on a single shift. We continue to improve the efficiency of our disposable cartridge manufacturing process. For instance, in 2017, we began manufacturing t:flex cartridges primarily using the same semi-automated manufacturing equipment used in the manufacture of t:slim X2 cartridges, and reduced the number of operators required to operate a production line. 
 
The cartridge automation equipment is designed to operate at capacity. As such, the line is constructed in several modular sections that perform different aspects of the assembly. This is important because at any given time, maintenance, service or inspection can be performed on any one section independent of the rest of the line. The manufacturing process may then continue uninterrupted while the assembly step is performed manually until the automation section is back on-line. 
 
Outside suppliers are the source for most of the components and some sub-assemblies in the production of our insulin pumps. Any sole and single source supplier is managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory in house and at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. 
 
Our suppliers are evaluated, approved and monitored periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various steps during the manufacturing cycle to facilitate compliance with our devices’ stringent specifications. 
 
We have received certification from BSI Group, a Notified Body to the International Standards Organization, or ISO, of our quality system. This ISO 13485 certification now extends to our new manufacturing facility on Barnes Canyon Road. Certain processes utilized in the manufacturing and testing of our devices have been verified and validated as required by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. As a medical device manufacturer, our manufacturing facility and the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and certain corresponding state agencies. 
 
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development team includes employees who specialize in software engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fluid dynamics and graphical user interface design, many of whom have considerable experience in diabetes-related products. Our research and development team focuses on the continuous improvement and support of current product offerings, as well as our products under development. 
 
26

In June 2015, we entered into non-exclusive agreements with Dexcom to allow the integration of our insulin pump products with the Dexcom G5 and G6 CGM systems worldwide. Each agreement has an initial term of five years, and thereafter renew automatically for additional one-year terms unless either party provides advance notice to the other party that they do not wish to extend the agreement. The agreements do not require any licensing fees, milestone payments or royalty obligations to Dexcom. The agreements contain customary provisions for termination in the event of an uncured material breach or in the event of a dissolution of the other party, and prohibit our assignment of the agreements to a Dexcom competitor without Dexcom’s prior consent. 
 
In 2016, we entered into a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license agreement with TypeZero to allow the integration of our insulin pump products with TypeZero’s inControl AID technology. The agreement also provides us access to TypeZero’s future AID innovations for five years following the date of the agreement. In addition, the license agreement contemplates that our insulin pump products will be used alongside TypeZero’s AID technology in the IDCL Trial. The agreement is effective until the patents covered by the agreement have expired, but also contains customary provisions for termination in the event of an uncured material breach. 
 
Research and development costs were $20.7 million, $18.8 million, and $17.0 million for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We have made protection of our intellectual property a strategic priority. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. 
 
As of December 31, 2017 our patent portfolio consisted of approximately 58 issued U.S. patents and 49 pending U.S. patent applications. Of these, our issued U.S. patents expire between approximately 2021 and 2036. We are also seeking patent protection for our proprietary technology in other countries throughout the world. In addition, we also have 23 trademark registrations, including 10 U.S. trademark registrations and 13 foreign trademark registrations.
 
In July 2012, we entered into an agreement with Smiths Medical pursuant to which we were granted, through certain assignments and certain non-exclusive and exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free licenses, certain rights to patents and patent applications related to ambulatory infusion pumps and related software and accessories for the treatment of diabetes. We agreed to pay $5.0 million in license fees and to share equally any associated sublicense revenues we may receive. As of December 31, 2017, we had paid the initial license fees in full and have not entered into any sublicense agreements. 
 
Competition 
 
The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, treatment techniques or technologies, or other market activities of industry participants. We compete with a number of companies that manufacture insulin delivery devices, such as Medtronic MiniMed, a division of Medtronic, and Insulet Corporation. However, the market for insulin pumps is currently undergoing significant changes. For instance, in late 2016, Roche Diabetes Care, a division of F. Hoffman-La Roche, discontinued sales of new insulin pumps in the United States. In October 2017, Johnson & Johnson announced that it intends to discontinue the operations of Animas and exit the insulin pump business entirely, and that it has designated Medtronic as a preferred partner to facilitate the transition of Animas insulin pump customers. Most recently, in late 2017, Eli Lilly & Co. announced that it is developing an insulin pump with AID technology that it intends to launch in the next two to three years. However, it is difficult to predict the potential impact of these changes on our competitive landscape.
 
Our current primary competitors are either publicly traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies. These companies have several competitive advantages over us, including greater financial resources for sales and marketing and product development, established relationships with healthcare providers and third-party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For instance, Insulet offers an insulin pump with a tubeless delivery system that does not utilize an infusion set, and Medtronic offers a traditional insulin pump that is integrated with a CGM system featuring a hybrid closed-loop AID algorithm. 
 
27

In addition, we face competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing pharmaceutical companies that are pursuing new delivery devices, delivery technologies, sensing technologies, procedures, drugs and other therapeutics for the monitoring, treatment and prevention of diabetes.

Government Regulation
 
Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, corresponding state regulatory authorities and, if we commence international sales, other regulatory bodies in other countries. The FDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern: 

• | product design and development;
--+--------------------------------


• | pre-clinical and clinical testing;
--+-----------------------------------


• | establishment registration and product listing;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | labeling and storage;
--+----------------------


• | pre-market clearance or approval; advertising and promotion;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | product sales and distribution;
--+--------------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | servicing and post-market surveillance.
--+----------------------------------------

 
FDA’s Pre-Market Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA through the PMA process. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. t:slim, t:flex, t:slim X2 and t:connect received FDA clearance as Class II devices. However, t:connect was subsequently down-classified to a Class I device. A PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. t:slim G4 and t:slim X2 with Dexcom’s G5 sensor integration received FDA approval as a Class III device. 
 
We first obtained 510(k) clearance for t:slim in November 2011. Subsequently, in October 2014, we received 510(k) clearance for the updated t:slim, which included software modifications for feature enhancements. t:slim is one of the first insulin pumps to be cleared under the FDA’s Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative. Infusion pumps are one of the most commonly recalled categories of medical devices, often as a result of deficiencies in device design and engineering. The Infusion Pump Improvement Initiative is intended to improve the current pre-market and post-market regulatory processes and requirements associated with infusion pumps and other home use medical devices. As part of this effort, the FDA continuously reviews adverse event reporting and recall processes for insulin pumps. 
 
28

We obtained 510(k) clearance for t:connect in February 2013 and for t:flex in January 2015. In September 2015, we received approval of our PMA for t:slim G4. In July 2016, we received FDA clearance for the Tandem Device Updater. Also in 2016, we received FDA clearance for an expanded pediatric indication for t:slim and t:slim X2, lowering its use to children ages six and older from children ages 12 and older.
 
A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 
 
FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 
 
 
• | systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 
 
29

Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
 
• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients do not comply with trial protocols;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | patients experience adverse side effects;
--+------------------------------------------


• | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Requirements. Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
 
 
• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------

 
30

 
• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 
 
In general, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences: 
 
 
• | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


• | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


• | delays in approving or refusal to approve future products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


• | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


• | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


• | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
31

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers, or regulated suppliers, are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. 
 
Licensure. Several states require that durable medical equipment, or DME, providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Some of these states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location or retain a licensed pharmacist, and in those states we sell our products through a third-party distributor. Although we believe we are in compliance with applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure. We believe that our certified diabetes educators are in compliance with all such state laws. However, if our educators or we were to be found non-compliant in a given state, we may need to modify our approach to providing education, clinical support and customer service. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws. There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. 
 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. HHS has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will result in the transaction or arrangement being exempt from scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued, but that the facts and circumstances of such arrangement or transaction may be reviewed on a case by case basis to determine if an intent to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute is present. Thus, arrangements and transactions that do not fully satisfy each element of an applicable safe harbor carry an increased risk of scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 
 
The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, criminal fines of up to $25,000 per violation, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation plus treble damages, and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or PPACA, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes. An individual or entity no longer is required to have actual knowledge of a particular statute or specific intent to violate it. PPACA also provides that claims submitted in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute automatically constitute false claims for purposes of the False Claims Act.

We provide the initial training to customers necessary for appropriate use of our products either through our own diabetes educators or by contracting with outside diabetes educators who have completed a Tandem pump-training course. Outside diabetes educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value. Although we believe that these arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise, especially as enforcement of this law historically has been a high priority for the federal government. Noncompliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs (which could adversely affect our revenues to a material extent), restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.
 
Federal law also includes a statute commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, if the physician has a financial relationship with the company. The term “financial relationship” is very broadly defined to include ownership or investments interests, as well as compensation arrangements. CMS has issued numerous exceptions to the Stark Law. The prohibition on referrals of designed health services does not apply when the financial relationship created by an arrangement or transaction meets all of the requirements of an applicable exception. Many states have also enacted statutes similar to the federal Stark Law. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exception from the law. 
 
The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to not comply with applicable federal law. 
 
Federal False Claims Act. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines and/or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
On November 2, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, which provides for adjustments to civil money penalties. In particular, the 2015 legislation provided for an initial “catch up” adjustment, followed by annual adjustments thereafter. For violations of the False Claims Act that occurred on or before November 2, 2015, and for violations of the False Claims Act occurring after November 2, 2015 for which civil money penalties were assessed prior to August 1, 2016, penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the false claim. For civil money penalties assessed after August 1, 2016, and on or before February 3, 2017, for violations of the False Claims Act occurring after November 2, 2015, penalties include fines ranging from $10,781 to $21,563 per claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustains because of the false claim. Finally, for civil money penalties assessed after February 3, 2017 for violations of the False Claims Act that occurred after November 2, 2015, penalties include fines ranging from $10,957 to $21,916.
 
We submit reimbursement claims to federal healthcare programs, and we also may provide some coding and billing information to purchasers of our devices. These activities, if inappropriate, could result in liability under the False Claims Act. Further, claims arising from relationships which violate the Anti-Kickback Statute are considered to be false claims under the False Claims Act. Liability under the False Claims Act may also attach to claims arising from financial relationships which violate the Stark Law. We believe that we currently are in compliance with the federal government’s laws and regulations concerning the submission of claims and the provision of coding and billing information. However, because we cannot guarantee that the government or qui tam relators will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent, or our provider relationships as compliant, we may have exposure under the False Claims Act.

Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. We believe that our arrangements comply with the requirements of the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law. 
 
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. HIPAA is commonly referred to in reference to the rules pertaining to security and privacy of protected health information. However, HIPAA also created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these provisions of HIPAA. 
 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, also set forth privacy and security rules. The privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information (known as protected health information or PHI) by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own PHI and limiting most use and disclosures of PHI to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. The security rule protects PHI by requiring appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and security of such PHI. If we, or any of our service providers who have access to our PHI, are found to be in violation of the privacy and security rules under HIPAA and HITECH, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the privacy and security rules under HIPAA. However, even HIPAA compliant entities can experience security breaches resulting in potential liability under HIPAA. 
 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers, including medical device manufacturers, to submit annual data pertaining to payments or other transfers of value to covered recipients, including physicians. Manufacturers may be subject to audit for their compliance with this law. Failure to submit the required data in an accurate and timely manner may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries.
International Regulation 
 
We are evaluating international expansion opportunities. International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.

The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. 
 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed both the self-assessment and the third-party assessment of our operations by a Notified Body. Based on the outcome of those assessments, we anticipate receiving CE marking of our existing products in the first half of 2018, and beginning the commercialization of products outside the United States in the second half of 2018. This includes beginning direct commercial activities in Canada. Marketing our products in Canada requires regulatory approval of our products from Health Canada. We filed our medical device license application with Health Canada in February 2018. The timing of our international launch will remain dependent on other activities, including our completion of appropriate translations for our products and associated materials, software updates to our pump products to allow for alternative units of measurement and a 24 hour clock, our ability to commence manufacturing of our products for use outside the United States, and our entering into distribution agreements with third party distributors in the relevant geographies.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 574 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
