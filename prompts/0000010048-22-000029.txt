ITEM 1.                                     BUSINESS
Overview
Barnwell was incorporated in Delaware in 1956 and fiscal 2022 represented Barnwell’s 66th year of operations. Barnwell operates in the following three principal business segments:

•Oil and Natural Gas Segment  -  Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisitions and sales in Canada and in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.

•Land Investment Segment  -  Barnwell invests in land interests in Hawaii.

•Contract Drilling Segment  -  Barnwell provides well drilling services and water pumping system installation and repairs in Hawaii.

Oil and Natural Gas Segment
Overview
Barnwell acquires and develops crude oil and natural gas assets in the province of Alberta, Canada via two corporate entities, Barnwell of Canada and Octavian Oil. Barnwell of Canada is a U.S. incorporated company that has been active in Canada for over 50 years, primarily as a non-operator participating in exploration projects operated by others. Octavian Oil is a Canadian company incorporated in 2016 to achieve growth through the acquisition and development of crude oil reserves and development of those reserves. Additionally, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BOK Drilling, LLC (“BOK”), established in February 2021, Barnwell is indirectly involved in oil and natural gas investments in Oklahoma. 
Strategy
Barnwell’s Canadian oil and natural gas assets are currently managed as two categories based on their differing attributes and strategies: Twining and Legacy. 
Twining consists of assets in the Twining field, in Alberta, Canada, that were purchased in August 2018 and additions to the field subsequently. These assets are partially operated by the Company and partially operated by Pine Cliff Energy Ltd. The oil wells operated by the Company are largely low decline wells, less than 15% per year decline rates, and due to these lower decline rates, these Twining oil wells require a lower amount of capital investment than higher decline rate wells. This lower capital requirement along with the fact that the land is largely held indefinitely, enables development drilling to be done when commodity prices support it. Since Barnwell’s entry into the Twining property, we have participated in drilling eight gross horizontal development wells that were completed with multi-stage sand fracs, all of which have been or are forecast to be profitable. Of these eight wells, two are 100%-owned operated wells chosen by Barnwell and six gross (1.7 net) are non-operated wells. Barnwell plans to continue to develop the pool with more horizontal wells if commodity prices continue to support their profitability.
The Legacy category consists of the Company's Canadian oil and natural gas assets not in the Twining area which are largely non-operated. The Canadian Legacy assets are located throughout Alberta, Canada, and produce shallow gas and conventional oil from a variety of pools. These assets have been accumulated over decades of Barnwell activity. Barnwell continues to evaluate opportunities to either divest the legacy Canadian assets or add to them through acquiring working interests depending on technical and economic evaluations. 
In Oklahoma, the Company commenced participation in an eight-well drilling program with non-operated working interests for seven wells varying from 1.2% to 4.2% and a minor overriding royalty interest, 0.07%, in one well. Additional drilling opportunities in the U.S. are being investigated.
At September 30, 2022, Barnwell’s reserves were approximately 54% operated and consisted of 56% conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 44% natural gas. At September 30, 2021, Barnwell’s reserves were approximately 64% operated and consisted of 56% conventional oil and natural gas liquids and 44% natural gas. 
Operations
All acquisitions, operational and developmental activities in the Twining area are the responsibility of the President and Chief Operating Officer of Octavian Oil with approvals for major expenditures secured from Barnwell’s executive management and, when applicable, the Board of Directors.

Our oil and natural gas segment revenues, profitability, and future rate of growth are dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and the Company’s ability to use its current cash, obtain external financing or generate sufficient cash flows to fund the development of our reserves. In the recent past, the industry experienced a period of low oil and natural gas prices that negatively impacted our past operating results, cash flows and liquidity. Credit and capital markets for oil and natural gas companies have been negatively affected as well, resulting in a decline in sources of financing as compared to previous years. Oil and natural gas prices have recovered significantly from the prior year which could improve sources of external finances.
Natural gas prices are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to increased heating demand. Oil prices also are subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree. Oil and natural gas unit sales are based on the quantity produced from the properties by the respective property operators. Prices received in Canada also have been negatively impacted by the lack of export pipeline capacity. 
Preparation of Reserve Estimates
Barnwell’s reserves are estimated by our independent petroleum reserve engineers, InSite Petroleum Consultants Ltd. (“InSite”) in Canada and Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”) in the U.S., in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and techniques and rules and regulations of the SEC. All information with respect to the Company’s Canadian reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of InSite and a copy of the report issued by InSite is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.1. All information with respect to the Company’s U.S. reserves in this Form 10-K is derived from the report of Ryder Scott and a copy of the report issued by Ryder Scott is filed with this Form 10-K as Exhibit 99.2. 

The preparation of data used by the independent petroleum reserve engineers to compile our oil and natural gas reserve estimates was completed in accordance with various internal control procedures 
which include verification of data input into reserves evaluation software, reconciliations and reviews of data provided to the independent petroleum reserve engineers to ensure completeness, and management review controls, including an independent internal review of the final reserve report for completeness and accuracy.

Barnwell has a Reserves Committee consisting of two independent directors and Barnwell's CEO. The Reserves Committee was established to ensure the independence of the Company’s petroleum reserve engineers. The Reserves Committee is responsible for reviewing the annual reserve evaluation reports prepared by the independent petroleum reserve engineering firms and ensuring that the reserves are reported fairly in a manner consistent with applicable standards. The Reserves Committee meets annually to discuss reserve issues and policies and to meet with Company personnel and the independent petroleum reserve engineers.

Barnwell of Canada’s President and Chief Operating Officer is a professional engineer with over 25 years of relevant experience in the oil and natural gas industry in Canada and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta.
Reserves
The amounts set forth in the following table, based on our independent reserve engineers’ evaluation of our reserves, summarize our estimated proved reserves of oil (including natural gas liquids) and natural gas as of September 30, 2022 for all properties located in Canada and the U.S. in which Barnwell has an interest. All of our oil and natural gas reserves are based on constant dollar price and cost assumptions. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available. Proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) existing at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed oil and natural gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made. No estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with, or included in reports to, any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, since October 1, 2021.

 | As of September 30, 2022 
 | Estimated Net Proved Developed Reserves | Estimated Net Proved Undeveloped Reserves | | Estimated Net Proved Reserves
Oil, including natural gas liquids (Bbls) | 1,046,000 | | 34,000 | | 1,080,000
Natural gas (Mcf) | 4,857,000 | | 128,000 | | 4,985,000
Total (Boe) | 1,883,000 | | 56,000 | | 1,939,000

During fiscal 2022, Barnwell’s total net proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas liquids increased by 410,000 Bbls (64%) and total net proved developed reserves of natural gas increased by 1,944,000 Mcf (67%), for a combined increase of 745,000 Boe (65%). The increase in natural gas reserves 
were primarily the result of higher oil and gas prices resulting in positive revisions in the current year period.
The following table sets forth Barnwell’s oil and natural gas net reserves at September 30, 2022, by location and property name, based on information prepared by our independent reserve engineers, as well as net production and net revenues by location and property name for the year ended September 30, 2022. The reserve data in this table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at September 30, 2022, the date of the projection.

Net proved reserves that are attributable to existing producing wells are primarily determined using decline curve analysis and rate transient analysis, which incorporates the principles of hydrocarbon flow. Net proved reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. Technologies relied on to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility include electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available production data, seismic data and well test data.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The following table sets forth Barnwell’s “Estimated Future Net Revenues” from total proved oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves located in Canada and the U.S. and the present value of Barnwell’s “Estimated Future Net Revenues” (discounted at 10%) as of September 30, 2022. Estimated future net revenues for total proved reserves are net of estimated future expenditures of developing and producing the proved reserves, and assume the continuation of existing economic conditions. Net revenues have been calculated using the average first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period ending as of the balance sheet date and current costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs, future estimated capital expenditures (including abandonment costs), and income taxes. The amounts below include future cash flows from reserves that are currently proved undeveloped reserves and do not deduct general and administrative or interest expenses.

Year ending September 30, | | 
2023 | $ | 10,645,000 | 
2024 | 6,976,000 | 
2025 | 5,007,000 | 
Thereafter | 8,206,000 | 
Undiscounted future net cash flows, after income taxes | $ | 30,834,000 | 
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 27,878,000 | *

_______________________________________________
*      This amount does not purport to represent, nor should it be interpreted as, the fair value of Barnwell’s oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the value of Barnwell’s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of $4.12 per Mcf and an oil price of $81.01 per Bbl) and costs, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve estimates.
Barnwell has included all abandonment, decommissioning and reclamation costs and inactive well costs in accordance with best practice recommendations into the Company’s reserve reports. 
Oil and Natural Gas Production
The following table summarizes (a) Barnwell’s net production for the last three fiscal years, based on sales of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest, and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such production during the same periods. Production amounts reported are net of royalties. All of Barnwell’s net production in fiscal 2022 and 2021 was derived in Alberta, Canada and in Oklahoma. Barnwell's net production in fiscal 2020 was derived in Alberta, Canada. For a discussion regarding our total annual production volumes, average sales prices, and related production costs, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Capital Expenditures and Acquisitions
Barnwell invested $11,052,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2022, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations. Barnwell’s capital expenditures were mostly for the drilling of wells in the Twining area and also were for facilities expansion and upgrade costs in the Twining area and the acquisition of additional working interests in several wells in the Twining area.
Barnwell invested $2,217,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2021, including accrued capital expenditures and acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations. Barnwell’s capital expenditures were mostly for the acquisition of additional working interests in several wells and equipment in the Twining area and the drilling of wells in Oklahoma that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
Well Drilling Activities
The Company participated in the drilling of six gross (1.7 net) non-operated development wells in the Twining area during the year ended September 30, 2022. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these non-operated development wells totaled $4,366,000 for the year ended September 30, 2022. Five gross (1.4 net) wells were producing at September 30, 2022 and the remaining one gross (0.3 net) well is awaiting tie-in and is expected to produce in fiscal 2023. The Company drilled one gross (1.0 net) operated development well in the Twining area which was producing at September 30, 2022. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for this operated well was $2,852,000. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2022.
In fiscal 2021, the Company participated in the drilling of seven gross (0.2 net) non-operated development wells in Oklahoma. Capital expenditures incurred by the Company for these Oklahoma wells totaled $1,178,000 for the year ended September 30, 2021. All wells were producing during the year 
ended September 30, 2022, producing 42,000 barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 192,000 Mcf of natural gas. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Canada during the year ended September 30, 2021.
In fiscal 2020, the Company drilled one gross (1.0 net) horizontal development well in the Twining area. The Company did not drill or participate in the drilling of wells in Oklahoma during the year ended September 30, 2020.
Producing Wells
As of September 30, 2022, Barnwell had interests in 148 gross (62.4 net) producing wells in Alberta, Canada, of which 93 gross (55.2 net) were oil wells and 55 gross (7.2 net) were natural gas wells and had interests in seven gross (0.2 net) producing oil wells in Oklahoma.
Developed Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage
The following table sets forth the gross and net acres of both developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases in Canada which Barnwell held as of September 30, 2022. The acreage of developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas leases in the U.S. are not significant and are therefore not included in the table below. 

 | Developed Acreage* | Undeveloped Acreage* | Total 
Location | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Canada | 136,220 | 32,890 | 28,400 | 8,210 | 164,620 | 41,100

_________________________________________________
*                  “Developed Acreage” includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing wells. “Undeveloped Acreage” includes acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are maintained by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of drilling thereon.

Eighty-six percent of Barnwell’s undeveloped acreage is not subject to expiration at September 30, 2022. Fourteen percent of Barnwell’s leasehold interests in undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration and expire over the next five fiscal years, if not developed, as follows: 12% expire during fiscal 2023; no expirations during fiscal 2024 and 2025; 2% expire during fiscal 2026; and no expirations during fiscal 2027. There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its leasehold interests in the event of expiration.
Much of the undeveloped acreage is at non-operated properties over which we do not have control, and the value of such acreage is not estimated to be significant at current commodity prices. Barnwell’s undeveloped acreage includes a significant concentration in the Twining area (2,860 net acres).
Marketing of Oil and Natural Gas 

Barnwell sells its Canadian oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids production, including under short-term contracts between itself and two main oil marketers, one natural gas purchaser, and one natural gas liquids marketer. The prices received are freely negotiated between buyers and sellers and are determined from transparent posted prices adjusted for quality and transportation differentials. In fiscal 2022, over 80% of Barnwell’s Canadian oil and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices. Barnwell does not use derivative instruments to manage price risk.
In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Barnwell took most of its Canadian oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas “in kind” where Barnwell markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property market the products on Barnwell’s behalf. We sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids to a variety of energy marketing companies. Because our products are commodities for which there are numerous marketers, we are not dependent upon one purchaser or a small group of purchasers. Accordingly, the loss of any single purchaser would not materially affect our revenues.
Governmental Regulation
The jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste, allowable rates of production, environmental protection, and other matters. The amount of oil and natural gas produced is subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province. The province of Alberta and the Government of Canada also monitor the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and the conditions of removal; currently all our natural gas is sold within Alberta.

All of Barnwell’s Canadian gross revenues were derived from properties located within Alberta, which charges oil and natural gas producers a royalty for production within the province. Provincial royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery. Barnwell also pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold royalties on a portion of its oil and natural gas sales to parties other than the province of Alberta.
In January 2016, the Alberta Royalty Panel recommended a new modernized Alberta royalty framework which applies to wells drilled on or after January 1, 2017. The previous royalty framework will continue to apply to wells drilled prior to January 1, 2017 for a period of ten years, after which they will fall under the current royalty framework. Under the current royalty framework the same royalty calculation applies to both oil and natural gas wells, whereas the previous royalty framework had different royalties applicable to each category, and royalties are determined on a revenue minus cost basis where producers pay a flat royalty rate of 5% of gross revenues until a well reaches payout after which an increased post-payout royalty applies. Post payout royalties vary with commodity prices and are adjusted down for cost increases as wells age. 
In fiscal 2022 and 2021, 67% and 45%, respectively, of Canadian royalties related to Alberta government charges, and 33% and 55%, respectively, of royalties related to freehold, override and other charges which are not directly affected by the Alberta royalty framework.
In fiscal 2022, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Barnwell’s Canadian natural gas was 12%, and the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was 17%. In fiscal 2022, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on all of Oklahoma’s production was 23%. 
In June 2021, the AER announced that the previous Licensee Liability Program (“LLP”) would be replaced by the Licensee Life-Cycle Management via a Licensee Capability Assessment (“LCA”). The LCA is intended to be a more comprehensive assessment of corporate health and considers a wider variety of factors than those considered under the LLP and establishes clear expectations for industry with regards to the management of liabilities throughout the entire lifecycle of oil and gas projects. Factors considered are grouped into six factor groups, these being current financial distress, liability magnitude, resources lifespan, operations compliance, closure efficiency, and administrative compliance. These factors are compared to peer operators and ranked into three “Tiers.” Barnwell’s assessment under the LCA Program 
is currently favorable with Tier 1 or 2 overall rankings in the six factor groups. Barnwell believes it can continue to manage its operations to maintain a favorable ranking. Importantly, an inventory reduction program also has been implemented which requires mandatory annual minimum expenditures towards outstanding decommissioning and reclamation obligations in accordance with five-year rolling spending targets. Currently, these targets are forecast by the AER to increase by 9% per year. These targets became effective January 1, 2022. Barnwell believes the targets assessed by the AER are within estimated forecasts for Barnwell’s future ARO spending and therefore the Company will be in compliance with spend targets under the Inventory Reduction Program.
In September 2019, the AER issued an abandonment/closure order for all wells and facilities in the Manyberries area which had been largely operated by LGX, an operating company that went into receivership in 2016. The estimated asset retirement obligation for the Company's interest in the wells and facilities in the Manyberries area is included in “Asset retirement obligation” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Recently, the OWA created a WIP program for specific areas where there are a significant number of orphaned wells to abandon. The OWA has the ability and expertise to abandon wells using its internal resources and network of service providers resulting in efficiencies that companies such as Barnwell, would not be able to obtain on its own. Under the WIP program, the Company would be required to provide payment for only Barnwell’s working interest share, however, all WIP’s would have to participate in the program for the OWA to begin its work. In March 2021, the Company was notified by the OWA that Barnwell’s Manyberries wells were confirmed to be in the WIP program.
Under the new agreement with the OWA, the Company is required to pay the abandonment and reclamation costs in advance through a cash deposit. The total cash deposit amount was calculated to be approximately $1,525,000 and the Company paid $888,000 of the total deposit in July and August 2021 and will need to pay the remaining balance of $637,000 by August 2023. The Company revised its Manyberries ARO liability based on the OWA’s revised abandonment and reclamation estimates, which resulted in an increase of approximately $213,000 in the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the ARO liability was a result of higher reclamation and remediation costs than anticipated, partially offset by lower abandonment estimates. Based on a review of the details of the cash deposit calculation provided by the OWA, which includes amounts added for possible contingencies, the Company believes the required cash deposit amount by the OWA is higher than the actual costs of the asset retirement obligation for the Manyberries wells and that any excess of the deposit over actual asset retirement costs for the first phase of the work would be credited toward the second phase of the work. A remaining excess deposit, if any, would ultimately be refunded to the Company upon completion of all of the work. As at September 30, 2022, the Company recognized a cumulative reduction in the deposit balance of $113,000 for work performed under this program.
Over the past five years, the Company has worked to reduce its abandonment and reclamation obligations associated with its oil and natural gas segment, both by divesting low-productivity assets and actively closing wells and sites. Sixteen Barnwell operated sites have been certified as fully reclaimed or exempt since 2016. To aid in this regard, and as a stimulus response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Federal Government created and funded the Alberta-administered Site Rehabilitation Program (“SRP”) in spring 2020. The SRP has been designed to reduce oil and gas industry liabilities by funding vendors who perform closure work. In partnership with its vendors, Barnwell-operated sites have received $388,000 in net funding to date, to be directed to ARO reduction activities. Barnwell has further benefited from grants allocated to its non-operated property partners amounting to $120,000.
Competition
Barnwell competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price and on the ability to deliver products. The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the acquisition and development of new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities. The competition comes from numerous major oil companies as well as numerous other independent operators. There also is competition between the oil and natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Barnwell is a minor participant in the industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources.
Land Investment Segment
Overview
Barnwell owns a 77.6% interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership (“Kaupulehu Developments”) that has the right to receive payments from KD I and KD II resulting from the sale of lots and/or residential units by KD I and KD II within the approximately 870 acres of the Kaupulehu Lot 4A area in two increments (“Increment I” and “Increment II”), located approximately six miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the island of Hawaii. Kaupulehu Developments also holds an interest in approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to Lot 4A under a lease that terminates in December 2025, which currently has no development potential without both a development agreement with the lessor and zoning reclassification.

    Barnwell, through two limited liability limited partnerships, KD Kona and KKM Makai (“KKM”), holds a non-controlling ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships comprised of KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KDK. The Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships own certain real estate and development rights interests in the Kukio, Maniniowali and Kaupulehu portions of Kukio Resort, a private residential community on the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii, as well as Kukio Resort’s real estate sales office operations. KDK holds interests in KD I and KD II. KD I is the developer of Increment I, and KD II is the developer of Increment II. Barnwell's ownership interests in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Operations
In the 1980s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family residential units. These projects were developed by an unaffiliated entity on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on approximately 870 leasehold acres, known as Lot 4A, zoned for resort/residential development, located adjacent to and north of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. In 2004 and 2006, Kaupulehu Developments sold its leasehold interest in Kaupulehu Lot 4A to KD I's and KD II's predecessors in interest, which was prior to Barnwell’s affiliation with KD I and KD 
II which commenced on November 27, 2013, the acquisition date of our ownership interest in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships.

Increment I is an area of 80 single-family lots, 78 of which were sold from 2006 to 2022, and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean. The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki`o Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka`upulehu. Increment II is the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse. Two residential lots of approximately two to three acres in size fronting the ocean were developed within Increment II and sold by KD II, and the remaining acreage within Increment II is not yet under development. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop the other areas of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. The remaining 420 developable acres at Increment II are entitled for up to 350 homesites. No definitive development plans have been made by the developer of Increment II as of the date of this report.
Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to receive payments from KD I based on 10% of the gross receipts from KD I's sales of single-family residential lots in Increment I. In fiscal 2022, six single-family lots were sold and two single-family lots, of the 80 lots developed within Increment I, remained to be sold as of September 30, 2022.

In March 2019, KD II admitted a new development partner, Replay Kaupulehu Development, LLC (“Replay”), a party unrelated to Barnwell, in an effort to move forward with development of the remainder of Increment II at Kaupulehu. KDK and Replay hold ownership interests of 55% and 45%, respectively, of KD II and Barnwell has a 10.8% indirect non-controlling ownership interest in KD II through KDK, which is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Barnwell continues to have an indirect 19.6% non-controlling ownership interest in KD Kukio Resorts, KD Maniniowali, and KD I.
Under the terms of the Increment II agreement with KD II, Kaupulehu Developments is entitled to 15% of the distributions of KD II, the cost of which is to be solely borne by KDK out of its 55% ownership interest in KD II, plus a priority payout of 10% of KDK’s cumulative net profits derived from Increment II sales subsequent to Phase 2A, up to a maximum of $3,000,000 as to the priority payout. Such interests are limited to distributions or net profits interests and Barnwell does not have any partnership interests in KD II or KDK through its interest in Kaupulehu Developments. The arrangement also gives Barnwell rights to three single-family residential lots in Phase 2A of Increment II, and four single-family residential lots in phases subsequent to Phase 2A when such lots are developed by KD II, all at no cost to Barnwell. Barnwell is committed to commence construction of improvements within 90 days of the transfer of the four lots in the phases subsequent to Phase 2A as a condition of the transfer of such lots. Also, in addition to Barnwell’s existing obligations to pay professional fees to certain parties based on percentages of its gross receipts, Kaupulehu Developments also is obligated to pay an amount equal to 0.72% and 0.2% of the cumulative net profits of KD II to KD Development and a pool of various individuals, respectively, all of whom are partners of KKM and are unrelated to Barnwell, in compensation for the agreement of these parties to admit the new development partner for Increment II. Such compensation will be reflected as the obligation becomes probable and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated.
In fiscal 2022, the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships sold six lots in Increment I and as a result of the lot sales, made cash distributions to its partners of which Barnwell received $3,400,000 resulting in a net amount of $3,028,000, after distributing $372,000 to non-controlling interests.
Competition
Barnwell’s land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of property interests presently owned. The competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and other industries involved in land investment activities. The principal factors affecting competition are the location of the project and pricing. Barnwell is a minor participant in the land development industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other entities having far greater financial and other resources.
Contract Drilling Segment
Overview
Barnwell’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water Resources, drills water and water monitoring wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and repairs water pumping systems, and is the distributor for Trillium Flow Technologies, previously known as Floway, pumps and equipment in the state of Hawaii.
Operations
Water Resources owns and operates three water well drilling rigs, two pump rigs and other ancillary drilling and pump equipment. Additionally, Water Resources leases month-to-month a storage facility in Honolulu, Hawaii, and leases a one-acre maintenance and storage facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and a one-half acre equipment storage yard in Waimea, Hawaii. Water Resources also maintains an inventory of uninstalled materials for jobs in progress and an inventory of drilling materials and pump supplies.
Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations. The demand for Water Resources’ services is primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii. Water Resources markets its services to land developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through public notices, its officers’ involvement in the community and referrals. Contracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and are negotiated with private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities or local, state and federal agencies. Contract revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities involved. Contracts provide for arbitration in the event of disputes.
During the year ended September 30, 2022, Water Resources sold a drilling rig and related ancillary equipment to an independent third party for proceeds of $687,000, net of related costs, which was equivalent to its net carrying value. No drilling rigs were sold in fiscal 2021.
In October 2022, Water Resources sold an additional drilling rig to an independent third party for proceeds of $551,000, net of related costs and accordingly, the Company will recognize a $551,000 gain on the sale of the drilling rig in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 ending December 31, 2022 as the rig was fully depreciated.

In fiscal 2022, Water Resources started two well drilling and four pump installation and repair contracts and completed three well drilling and three pump installation and repair contracts. Of the three 
completed well drilling contracts, one was started in fiscal 2018 and two were started in fiscal 2019. Of the three completed pump installation and repair contracts, one was started in fiscal 2016, one was started in fiscal 2020 and one was started in the current year. Fifty-two percent of well drilling and pump installation and repair jobs, representing 59% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2022, have been pursuant to government contracts.
At September 30, 2022, there was a backlog of seven well drilling and 14 pump installation and repair contracts, of which four well drilling and 10 pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of September 30, 2022.

The approximate dollar amount of Water Resources’ backlog of firm well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts at December 1, 2022 and 2021 was as follows:

 | December 1,
 | 2022 | | 2021
Well drilling | $ | 10,000,000 | | | $ | 8,000,000
Pump installation and repair | 1,200,000 | | | 1,500,000 | 
 | $ | 11,200,000 | | | $ | 9,500,000


Of the contracts in backlog at December 1, 2022, $8,600,000 is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2023 with the remainder to be recognized in the following fiscal year.
Competition
Water Resources competes with other drilling contractors in Hawaii, some of which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources’. These competitors also are capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible water pumping systems in Hawaii. These contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private contracts. Pricing is Water Resources’ major method of competition; reliability of service also is a significant factor.

Competitive pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the quantity or values of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2022 will continue.

Employees
At December 1, 2022, Barnwell employed 35 individuals; 34 on a full time basis and 1 on a part-time basis.

Environmental Costs
Barnwell is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations. U.S. Federal and state and Canadian Federal and provincial governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply, particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment. 
These laws, which are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites where it has a working interest.
