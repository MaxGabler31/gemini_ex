ITEM 1. Business
Our Company
 
Live Ventures Incorporated, a Nevada corporation originally incorporated in the State of New Mexico in 1968 as Nuclear Corporation of New Mexico, is a holding company for diversified businesses. Commencing in fiscal year 2015, we commenced a strategic shift in our business plan away from solely providing online marketing solutions for small and medium business to acquiring profitable companies in various industries that have demonstrated a strong history of earnings power. Prior to that shift, we primarily promoted online marketing solutions to small and medium businesses to help them boost customer awareness, gain visibility and manage their online presence under our Velocity Local™ brand. In 2013, we launched LiveDeal.com, a real-time “deal engine” that connects restaurants across the United States and consumers via an online mobile platform, and helps restaurants attract new customers.
 
Under the Live Ventures brand, we seek opportunities to acquire profitable and well-managed companies. We work closely with third parties to help us identify target companies that fit within the criteria we have established for opportunities.

Products
 
Carpets & Rugs
 
Marquis is one of the top residential carpet manufacturers in the U.S. by revenue and also produces innovative commercial products for the carpet industry. Marquis has 21 running line styles offering outstanding quality and value. It also offers special value in polyester styles and residential nylon roll buy. Beginning in 2014, Marquis began offering eight carpet styles with 6.8 twists or better, six styles in ¼ gauge construction and two with a 1/8 gauge construction.
Hard Surfaces
 
Marquis has developed one of the strongest and most competitive, high styled hard surface lines on the market. The Marquis Hard Surface running line is a mainstream line-up of high styled luxury vinyl tile, several unique laminates and hand scraped engineered wood along with six individual series of vinyl. Marquis Hard Surfaces also features hundreds of rolls of vinyl specials at promotional prices.
Yarns
 
Through its A-O Division, Marquis uses state-of-the-art yarn extrusion capacity to market monofilament textured yarn products to the artificial turf industry.
 
Industry and Market
 
Marquis is an integrated carpet manufacturer, seller of hard surface products and manufacturer of nylon and polypropylene monofilament turf yarn within a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2016, the U.S. floor covering industry had an estimated $24.47 billion in sales.
 
Floor covering sales are influenced by the homeowner remodeling and residential builder markets, existing home sales and housing starts, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, the condition of residential and commercial construction, and overall strength of the economy.

Our Market
 
Carpet and Rugs
 
The carpet and rug industry had shipments of $11.53 billion in 2016. The carpet and rugs industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry. The industry has two primary sub-markets, replacement and new construction, with the replacement market making up the larger portion of the sub-markets. Approximately 60% of industry shipments are made in response to residential replacement demand.
 
Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institutional applications including office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries.
 
The Carpet and Rug Institute (the "CRI") is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a meaningful percentage of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve.
 
Hard Surfaces
 
Hard flooring surfaces such as ceramic, luxury vinyl tile, hardwood, stone, and laminate have shipments of $12.94 billion in 2016. As with carpet and rugs, the market is split between residential and commercial and replacement and new construction, with residential replacement being the largest segment of the market.
Synthetic Turf
 
Northwest Georgia is also the home to a thriving synthetic turf industry, a relative of the carpet industry. Early versions of artificial turf, or fake grass, in domed and open-air sports stadiums used to be referred to as Astro Turf by the athletes who played upon the turf. Today, artificial turf is more akin to a manmade organism, with advanced underlay, cushioning and drainage systems. AstroTurf, the granddaddy of artificial turf, is headquartered in Dalton, GA.
 
Other major turf players in Georgia include Challenger Industries, Controlled Products, Synthetic Turf Resources, Fieldturf and Turf Store. Marquis, through its A-O Industries division, has developed significant yarn extrusion expertise and services the synthetic turf industry through the sale of highest quality yarns. We believe that Marquis is the only company in the industry able to efficiently perform certain texturizing processes that are valued by turf manufacturers.
 
Competition
 
The North American flooring industry is highly competitive with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Marquis competes with other flooring manufacturers and resellers. Marquis is a fully integrated carpet mill, and, as a result, is able to produce carpet at the lowest cost possible for its target price point. Marquis is a one stop shop for soft and hard surface products, allowing its customers to save time and receive exceptional service. Marquis offers innovative products and has quick turnaround times turning a new product in two weeks from conception to delivery. The principal methods of competition are service, quality, price, product innovation and technology. Marquis’ lean operating structure plus investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and marketing strategy contribute to its ability to provide exceptional value on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just competing on price.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our principal suppliers include Honeywell, DAK, Syntec, Global Backing and Mattex. We believe that we will have access to an adequate supply of raw material on satisfactory commercial terms for the foreseeable future. We are not dependent on any one supplier.

Customers
 
Marquis sells products to flooring dealers, home centers, other flooring manufacturers and directly to end users. Approximately 70% of sales are to a network of over 2,000 flooring dealers across several different end markets, geographies, and product lines. Management believes that the dealer market is the most profitable market for its products because it’s a diversified customer base that values innovation, style and service. Dealer networks typically allow Marquis to achieve higher margin, lower volume accounts. As a result, we are not dependent on any one customer to sustain our revenue. Although we also sell our products to a limited number of retailers, sales to those individual retailers make up a small percentage of Marquis’ revenue.
Manufacturing
 
Marquis has a manufacturing facility with state-of-the-art equipment in all phases of its vertically integrated production, from extrusion of yarn to yarn processing to tufting carpet. Marquis manufactures high quality products and offer unique customization with exceptionally short lead-times. Marquis has recently invested in new, efficient equipment to expand it yarn extrusion capacity to enter new markets. The new equipment allows Marquis to reduce production costs and increase margins. Marquis has existing capacity to grow sales by 25% without additional investment.
Marketing
 
Marquis has a team of 23 full-time salespeople who deepen customer relationships throughout its markets.
 
Retail and Online Segment

We were best known for migrating print yellow pages to the Internet in 1994 and began to develop the model for LiveDeal.com after having worked closely with well-known publishers in the daily deal market. In mid-2013, we tested the beta platform in a number of cities, and the model has been well received by restaurants, consumers, and various restaurant associations.
 
Marketing
 
Vintage Stock. Vintage Sock markets its stores primarily via social media aps including but not limited to individual store & corporate Facebook and Twitter accounts. A 200,000 plus customer active email list for weekly distribution of our digital new release catalog and promotion of online and brick and mortar sales and coupons. Vintage Stock also uses guerrilla marketing by partnering and setting up booths with movie theaters for blockbuster releases, various trade fairs, and school donations.
LiveDeal.com National Advertising Campaign. In 2014, we launched a 35 city advertising campaign to support the restaurant owners who have created more than 10,000 deals in over 8,000 restaurants in those 35 cities. The campaign, which includes TV, Radio and web-based ad delivery, was designed to expand awareness, increase user registrations and drive traffic into the restaurant locations that are utilizing the LiveDeal real-time “deal engine”.
Our Market
 
Vintage Stock. In 2015, we believe that revenue generated in the U.S. video game market was approximately $44 billion, representing an average annual growth rate of 4.0% in the four-year period since 2011. IBISWorld projects future growth due to an increasing population and increased percentage of Americans that play video games. Consequently, revenue is projected to reach $49.7 billion in 2021, growing at an annual rate of 2.4% from 2016 to 2021. In addition, filmed entertainment is distributed through a variety of channels, including out-of-home (movie theatres, airlines, etc.) and in-home (home video rental, pay-per-view, etc.). The retail home video industry includes the sale and rental of DVD movies by traditional store retailers, online retailers and other retailers. In 2015, the revenue generated in the U.S. movie and video distribution market was approximately $1.6 billion. The movie distribution industry is a mature industry that is growing at less than 1% year over year through 2020.
Competition
 

Vintage Stock. Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and frequent new product introductions. Competition is based on the ability to adopt new technology, aggressive franchising, establishment of brand names and quality of collections. The markets where we have a presence do not have many establishments that sell video games. For example, 0.6% of total video game retailers are in Oklahoma. In addition, although many competitors have entered the rental industry with streaming online content, the lack of broadband throughout the United States, particularly in the Midwest, has protected retailers of movies. Six of the seven states where Vintage Stock operates are among the 10 states with the worst internet speed. We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. We have, however, established a presence in areas where we can take a greater portion of market share. Video game products are also distributed through other methods such as digital delivery. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers. 
Promotional Marketing. Our LiveDeal.com platform competes for local deals with several large competitors, such as Groupon and LivingSocial, and many smaller competitors. This business is part of a new market which has operated at a substantial scale for only a limited period of time. We expect competition in this market to continue to increase because no significant barriers to entry exist. 
 
 We believe that we are in a position to compete in this market successfully due to the unique features of our LiveDeal.com platform (as described above), our experienced sales managers, our experience at sourcing, selling and servicing large numbers of small business accounts, the comprehensiveness of our database, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, and the diversity of our publisher distribution network. Our distribution partnerships allow our clients to reach large audiences and promote their products and services in innovative ways.
 
The principal competitive factors in this market include personalization of service, ease of use, quality of services, availability of quality content, value-added products and services, access to consumers, effectiveness at driving business to our clients, and price.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties. We currently rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and similar measures to protect our intellectual property.

We estimate that reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how will continue to be our principal method of protecting our trade secrets and other proprietary technologies. While we have hired third-party contractors to help develop our proprietary software and to provide various fulfillment services, we generally own (or have permissive licenses for) the intellectual property provided by these contractors. Our proprietary software is not substantially dependent on any third-party software, although our software does utilize open source code. Notwithstanding the use of this open source code, we do not believe our usage requires public disclosure of our own source code nor do we believe the use of open source code will have a material impact on our business.
 
We register some of our product names, slogans and logos in the United States. In addition, we generally require our employees, contractors and many of those with whom we have business relationships to sign non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. Neither intellectual property laws, contractual arrangements, nor any of the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property, can ensure that third parties will not exploit our technologies or develop similar technologies.
 
Our proprietary publishing system provides an advanced set of integrated tools for design, service, and modifications to support our mobile web app services. Our mobile web app builder software enables easy and efficient design, end user modification and administration, and includes a variety of other tools accessible by our team members.
 
Services Segment
 
We continue to generate revenue from servicing our existing customers under our legacy product offerings, primarily our InstantProfile® line of products and services. These services primarily consist of directory listing services. Because of the change in our business strategy and product lines, we no longer accept new customers under our legacy product and service offerings.
Corporate Offices
 
Our principal offices are located at 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, our telephone number is (702) 939-0231, and our corporate website (which does not form part of this Form 10-K) is located at www.live-ventures.com.
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2017, we had 1,211 employees, of which 608 were full-time employees, in the United States, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
