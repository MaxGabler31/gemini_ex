      Overview
     Our Company
     We are a women’s health care company focused on creating and commercializing products targeted exclusively for women. Currently, we are focused on pursuing the regulatory approvals and pre-commercialization activities necessary for commercialization of our advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. Our drug candidates that have completed clinical trials are designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes and vaginal discomfort. We are developing these hormone therapy drug candidates, which contain estradiol and progesterone alone or in combination, with the aim of demonstrating clinical efficacy at lower doses, thereby enabling an enhanced side-effect profile compared with competing products. With our SYMBODA™ technology, we are developing advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products to enable delivery of bio-identical hormones through a variety of dosage forms and administration routes. In addition, we manufacture and distribute branded and generic prescription prenatal vitamins.
     We have submitted two new drug applications, or NDAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. In December 2017, we submitted our NDA for TX-001HR, our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate, for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, or VMS, due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy, or VVA, in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. The NDA for our TX-004HR drug candidate has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review of May 29, 2018 and, if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018. If the NDA for TX-001HR is accepted by the FDA, it could be approved as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in 2019. We intend to leverage and grow our current marketing and sales organization to commercialize our advanced hormone therapy drug candidates in the United States assuming the successful completion of the FDA regulatory process. We believe that our national sales force has developed strong relationships in the OB/GYN market to sell our current prescription prenatal vitamin products and that by delivering additional products through the same sales channel we can leverage our already deployed assets.
     Throughout this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “TherapeuticsMD,” or “our company” refer to TherapeuticsMD, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and unless specified otherwise, include our wholly owned subsidiaries, vitaMedMD, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or VitaMed; BocaGreenMD, Inc., a Nevada corporation, or BocaGreen; and VitaCare Prescription Services, Inc., a Florida corporation, or VitaCare.
     Hormone Therapy Market
     The menopause hormone therapy market includes two major components: an FDA-approved drug market and a non-FDA approved drug market supplied by compounding pharmacies. On November 27, 2013, the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, or the DQSA, became law and the FDA was given additional oversight over compounding pharmacies. We believe FDA-approved products are easily measured and monitored, while non-FDA approved hormone therapy drug products, typically referred to as bioidenticals when produced and sold by compounding pharmacies, are not easily measured or monitored. We estimate the sales of non-FDA approved compounded bioidentical hormone therapy combinations of estradiol and progesterone products by compounding pharmacies approximate $1.5 billion per year. According to PHASTTM Prescription from Symphony Health IVD, or Symphony Heath Solutions, the market for FDA-approved hormone therapy products for the treatment of menopause symptoms or prevention of osteoporosis approximated $4.7 billion based on 2017 sales. Our phase 3 clinical trials were intended to establish an indication of the safety and efficacy of our hormone therapy drug candidates at specific dosage levels. We intend our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, to provide hormone therapies with well characterized safety and efficacy profiles that can be consistently manufactured to target specifications. This would provide an alternative to the non-FDA approved compounded bioidentical market. This is based on our belief that our drug candidates will offer advantages in terms of demonstrated safety and efficacy, consistency in the hormone dose, lower patient cost as a result of insurance coverage, and improved access as a result of availability from major retail pharmacy chains rather than custom order or formulation by individual compounders.
       1 

     Pipeline of our Hormone Therapy Drug Candidates
     TX-001HR
     TX-001HR is our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body, namely estradiol and progesterone, and is being studied as a continuous-combined regimen, in which the combination of estrogen and progesterone are taken together in one product daily. If approved by the FDA, we believe this would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product. According to Symphony Health Solutions, sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $588 million and sales of estradiol and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $952 million and approximately $404 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the recently completed REPLENISH Trial, our phase 3 clinical trial of TX-001HR, and on December 28, 2017 we submitted an NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.
     TX-002HR
     TX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial, our phase 3 clinical trial for TX-002HR, to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, related to TX-002HR is currently in inactive status. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates.
     TX-003HR
     TX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive.
     TX-004HR
     TX-004HR is our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. We believe that our drug candidate will be at least as effective as the traditional treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure, and it will have an added advantage of being a simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. According to Symphony Health Solutions, sales of FDA-approved products for VVA treatment were approximately $1.8 million in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. In December 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial, our phase 3 clinical trial of TX-004HR. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR. The NDA has a PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review of May 29, 2018, and, if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018.
     Preclinical Development
     Based upon leveraging our SYMBODATM hormone technology, we have four preclinical projects that include development of a progesterone-alone and combination estradiol and progesterone products in a topical cream form, which we refer to as TX-005HR and TX-006HR, respectively, and transdermal patch form, which we refer to as TX-007HR and TX-008HR, respectively. We completed a proof-of-concept preclinical study of TX-005HR in 32 rats. The study used four groups of eight female ovariectomized rats, each of whom were treated with subcutaneous injections of estradiol for eight days. On day four of treatment, they were also dosed with a placebo, subcutaneous injections of progesterone or a similar dose of TX-005HR topical progesterone cream. The results, presented at North American Menopause Society, or NAMS, meeting in October 2015, showed that the progesterone in TX-005HR penetrated the skin and opposed the effect of subcutaneous estradiol on the endometrium. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted an IND application for TX-006HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate in a topical cream form, and intend to commence phase 1 clinical trials of this drug candidate as early as 2018. We may in the future engage with a financing partner to advance our topical cream and transdermal patch projects. We have recently conducted rat bioavailability studies on several novel, oral formulations of progesterone. We are currently adapting this formulation for the inclusion of estradiol and have embarked on its development as TX-009HR. In addition to menopausal treatments, we are also evaluating various other indications for our hormone technology, including contraception and premature ovarian failure.

     Current Products
     As we continue the clinical development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we continue to manufacture and distribute our prescription product lines, consisting of prenatal vitamins under our vitaMedMD® brand name and authorized generic formulations of some of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD® Prena1 name. All of our prenatal vitamins are gluten-, sugar-, and lactose-free. A prenatal vitamin option that is both vegan and kosher is also available for women with special dietary needs. We believe our product attributes result in greater consumer acceptance and satisfaction than competitive products while offering the highest quality and patented ingredients. As of January 1, 2017, we decided to focus on selling our prescription vitamins and ceased manufacturing and distributing our over-the-counter, or OTC, product lines, except for Iron 21/7 which we ceased manufacturing and distributing in October 2017. The sales of discontinued products have declined steadily over time resulting in immaterial sales.     Industry and Market
     Health Care and Pharmaceutical Market
     According to the EvaluatePharma® World Preview 2017, Outlook to 2022 report, despite the global pharmaceutical industry facing pricing and market access concerns, worldwide prescription drug sales are expected to reach approximately $1.1 trillion by 2022, which would represent a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% between 2017 and 2022. New drug approvals in 2016 dropped to 27 (consisting of new molecular entities and biologics), down 50%, as compared to the record high of 56 approvals in 2015. A positive drug approval trend was observed in the first months of 2017 with 21 novel drugs already approved as compared to 15 drugs approved up to May 2016, suggesting that the decline in approvals in 2016 was mostly due to timing of approvals rather than more structural dynamics. There were 51 new drugs (consisting of new molecular entities and biologics) approved by FDA in 2014.  The value of these drugs continues to be high, and with U.S. five years post-launch sales of the new drugs approved in 2016, 2015 and 2014 forecast to be over $14 billion, $30 billion, $23 billion, respectively.     Women’s Health Care Market
     According to the BBC Research report “Therapeutics for Women’s Health: Technologies and Global Markets,” menopause, post-menopause osteoporosis, endometriosis, breast cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are the most common issues within women’s health and the U.S. women’s health therapeutics market will grow from nearly $19.5 billion in 2015 to $25.3 billion by 2020, rising at compound annual growth rate of 5.4%. According to the GBI Research (a provider of industry-leading business intelligence solutions on a global basis) report “Women’s Health Therapeutic Market through 2018,” the women’s health therapeutics market is one of the most attractive markets in the global pharmaceutical industry. Hormone therapy, gynecological disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders in women are the prime areas of focus in the women’s health therapeutics market.     Hormone Therapy Market
     Menopause is the spontaneous and permanent cessation of menstruation, which naturally occurs in most women between the ages of 40 and 58. It is defined as the final menstrual period and is confirmed when a woman has not had her period for 12 consecutive months. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment in the United States and Canada for relief of menopausal symptoms according to NAMS. These symptoms are caused by the reduced levels of circulating estrogen as ovarian production shuts down. The symptoms include hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, and vaginal dryness. According to Symphony Health Solutions, prescriptions for FDA-approved hormone therapy products for the treatment of menopause symptoms or prevention of osteoporosis generated total U.S. sales of over $4.7 billion on over 30 million prescriptions for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, of which prescriptions for oral hormone therapy accounted for approximately $2.0 billion in U.S. sales on 20 million prescriptions over the same time period.
     Prescriptions for menopausal hormone therapy in the United States dropped significantly following the Women’s Health Initiative, or WHI, study in 2002, which found that subjects using conjugated equine estrogens plus the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate had, among other things, a greater incidence of coronary heart disease, breast cancer, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. A number of additional studies regarding the benefits and risks of hormone therapy have been conducted over the last decade since the WHI results were first published. In general, recommendations for hormone therapy use are to be judged on an individual basis, and the FDA recommends that women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms who want to try menopausal hormone therapy for relief use it for the shortest time needed and at the lowest effective dose.
       3 

     There were approximately 41.7 million women in the United States between the ages of 45 and 64 in 2010, projected to increase slightly by 2.8% to 42.9 million in 2015 and to approximately 44.3 million in 2040, according to the 2010 National Census population figures. These women are the target market for hormone therapy to treat menopausal related symptoms.
     Hormone Therapy Products
     Estrogen (with or without a progestin) is the most effective treatment of VMS and VVA due to menopause according to NAMS. According to Symphony Health Solutions, total U.S. sales of FDA-approved oral, transdermal, and suppository estrogen (with and without a progestin) hormone therapy products were approximately $4.0 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. The three primary hormone therapy products are estrogen, progestin, and combination of estrogen and progestin, which are produced in a variety of forms, including oral tablets or capsules, skin patches, gels, emulsion, or vaginal suppositories and creams.
     Estrogen-Only Therapies
     Estrogen therapies are used to treat VMS due to menopause that are a direct result of the decline in estrogen levels associated with ovarian shutdown at menopause. Estrogen therapy has been used to manage these symptoms for more than 50 years. Estrogen is a generic term for any substance, natural or synthetic, that exerts biological effects characteristic of estrogenic hormones, such as estradiol, a natural ovarian produced estrogen. Based upon the age demographic for all women receiving prescriptions for estrogen therapy and the average age range during which women experience VMS, we believe that estrogen is primarily used for the treatment of VMS, but also is prescribed for the prevention of osteoporosis.
     Estrogen-only therapy, or ET, is used primarily in women who have had a hysterectomy and/or have undergone surgical menopause, as those women do not require a progestin to protect the uterine endometrium. Approximately 433,000 women undergo a hysterectomy each year in the United States according to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ET is also used for the treatment of VVA, which has a variety of indications, including dyspareunia (painful intercourse), vaginal dryness, vaginal itching and irritation, painful urination, and other symptoms.
     ET is also approved for the prevention of osteoporosis. Multiple studies conducted on various estrogen compositions, including studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2002, Osteoporosis International in 2000, The Lancet in 2002, Maturitas in 2008, and Climacteric in 2005, suggested efficacy based on increases in bone mineral density. Epidemiological and some fracture prevention studies, such as the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1980, also have suggested a decrease in bone fractures as a result of ET.
     According to Symphony Health Solutions, total FDA-approved ET only U.S. sales amounted to $2.8 billion, of which $1.8 billion was specifically used for the treatment of VVA, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.
     Progestin-Only Therapies
     Progestins include the naturally occurring hormone progesterone and a number of synthetic progestin compounds that have progestational activity. These agents are used for a variety of indications and conditions, but most often, progestins are used either alone or in combination with an estrogen for hormonal contraception and to prevent endometrial hyperplasia from unopposed estrogen in hormone therapy. Progestins alone are also used to treat women with secondary amenorrhea in order to create withdrawal bleeding in these women who have not had regular menses. Progestins are also used to treat dysfunctional uterine bleeding and endometriosis. Progesterone has also been used to prevent threatened or recurrent pregnancy loss and for the prevention of preterm birth. Progestins have also been used in fertility treatments. Progestins have also been used as a palliative measure for metastatic endometrial carcinoma and in the treatment of renal and breast carcinoma.
     Estrogen/Progestin Combination Products
     Progestins are used in combination with estrogen in menopausal women with uteruses to avoid an increase in the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia, which is a condition caused by chronic use of estrogen alone by a woman with a uterus and is associated with an increased incidence of uterine, or endometrial, cancer. Studies have shown that, after one year, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia is less than 1% in women taking estrogen/progestin combinations, in contrast to up to 20% in women taking estrogen alone. In accordance with FDA recommendations, doctors typically recommend that a menopausal or post-menopausal woman who has a uterus take estrogen plus a progestin, either as a combination drug or as two separate drugs. Symphony Health Solutions estimates that sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $588 million and the sales of estradiol and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $952 million and approximately $404 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.
       4 

     Limitations of Existing Estrogen/Progestin Therapies
     The most commonly prescribed progestin is a synthetic progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate), which can cause some women to experience painful vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness, and bloating and may reduce cardio-protective benefits potentially associated with estrogen therapy by limiting the estrogen’s ability to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or good cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol. A widely prescribed naturally occurring progesterone is known as Prometrium® (progesterone USP). The brand is marketed by AbbVie Inc., and generic versions have been available since 2012. Natural progesterone is used in combination with estrogen for hormone therapy; however, we believe there are currently no FDA-approved hormone therapy combination products with natural progesterone.
     Prenatal Vitamin Market
     According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are approximately four million births per year in the U.S. Of women giving birth in the U.S., the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that approximately 73% received early prenatal care in the first trimester, while 6% began prenatal care in the third trimester or did not receive any prenatal care. Most doctors encourage taking a prenatal vitamin as the recommended standard of care. Prenatal vitamins are dietary supplements intended to be taken before and during pregnancy and during postnatal lactation that provide nutrients recognized by various health organizations as helpful for a healthy pregnancy outcome.
     There are hundreds of prenatal vitamins available, with both prescription and OTC choices. According to Symphony Health Solutions, during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 6.2 million prescriptions for prenatal vitamins were issued in the United States resulting in total sales of approximately $379 million, with sales between branded and generic products split nearly evenly.
     Our Business Model
     We are a women’s health care company focused on creating and commercializing products exclusively for women, including products specifically for pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, pre-menopause, and menopause. We have utilized our current product lines as the foundation of our business platform. If approved and commercialized, our hormone therapy drug candidates will allow us to enter the $4.7 billion market for FDA-approved hormone therapy products for the treatment of menopause symptoms or prevention of osteoporosis, based on 2017 total U.S. sales of the hormone therapy market, according to Symphony Health Solutions.
     Our current product line is marketed and sold by a direct national sales force that calls on health care providers in the OB/GYN market space. We market our prescription prenatal vitamins under our vitaMedMD brand name and authorized generic formulations of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD Prena1 brand name. We believe that our vitaMedMD brand name has become a recognized name for high quality women’s health care, while our BocaGreenMD products provide physicians, women, and payors with a lower Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) alternative for prenatal vitamins. We intend to leverage our existing relationships and distribution system to introduce our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, which we believe will enable us to provide a comprehensive line of women’s health care products all under one brand. As of January 1, 2017, we decided to focus on selling our prescription vitamins and ceased manufacturing and distributing our OTC product lines, except for Iron 21/7 which we ceased manufacturing and distributing in October 2017. The sales of discontinued products have declined steadily over time resulting in immaterial sales.
     Our sales model focuses on the “4Ps”: patient, provider, pharmacist, and payor. We market and sell our current products primarily through a direct national sales force of approximately 50 full-time professionals that calls on health care providers in the OB/GYN market space. In addition, our products allow health care providers to offer an alternative to patients to meet their individual nutritional and financial requirements related to co-payment and cost-of-care considerations and help patients realize cost savings over competing products. We also believe that our combination of branded and authorized generic lines offers physicians, women, and payors cost-effective alternatives for top-quality care. We supply our prescription products to consumers through retail pharmacies nationwide. Our fully staffed customer care center uses current customer relationship management software to respond to health care providers, pharmacies, and consumers via incoming and outgoing telephone calls, e-mails, and live-chat. As of January 1, 2017, we stopped selling our products through our websites directly to consumers.
       5 

     As health care becomes increasingly consumer driven, patients are seeking more information, control, and convenience, which places additional time and financial pressures on physicians, and as a result, physicians are looking for improved ways to provide better service to their patients. A recent study by IMS Health Inc. concluded that physicians desire fewer but more encompassing relationships with companies that can provide more valuable information, deliver more relevant services, and better respond to specific needs of their practice and patients. Our goal is to meet this challenge by focusing on the opportunities in women’s health, specifically the OB/GYN market, to provide a better customer experience for physician, payor, pharmacist, and patient through the following means:
    
● | We believe we will offer physicians a comprehensive product line of women’s health care products, including our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our hormone therapy drug candidates are designed to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | We believe the attributes of our dietary supplements will result in greater consumer acceptance and satisfaction than competitive products while offering the highest quality products incorporating patented ingredients, such as Quatrefolic®, FOLMAX®, FePlus®, and pur-DHA™. All of our prenatal vitamins are gluten-, sugar-, and lactose-free.
● | We strive to improve our existing products and develop new products to generate additional revenue through our existing sales channels. 
● | We believe health care providers are able to offer alternatives to patients that meet the patient’s individual nutritional and financial requirements and help patients realize cost savings over competing products. 
● | Improved patient education, a high level of patient compliance, and reduced cost of products all result in lower cost of care for payors and improved outcomes for patients. 

      Our Growth Strategy
     We are a women’s health care company with a corporate culture designed to foster innovation in the development and commercialization of products that address the needs of patients, pharmacists, payers and providers in the twenty-first century.
     We believe that building a culture of innovation around patient needs and opportunities, rather than focusing on specific drugs, will enable us to effectively develop and commercialize our products.
     Exclusive Focus on Women’s Health Issues. We have steadily developed relationships with many of the largest OB/GYN practices in the country through the sales of our line of prenatal vitamins. We believe that our singular focus on women’s health issues will enable us to continue to build long-term relationships with women as they move through their life cycles of family planning through menopause.
     Focus on Hormone Therapy Products. We plan to continue our focus on the development, clinical trials, and commercialization of hormone therapy products designed to (1) alleviate the symptoms of, and reduce the health effects resulting from, menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness, and (2) demonstrate equivalent clinical efficacy at lower doses, enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. We believe there is a large unmet need in this segment of the market.
     Penetrate Compounding Market with FDA-approved Products. As we are not aware of any current FDA-approved hormone therapy combination products that are bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries, we believe that our hormone therapy drug candidate for combined estradiol and progesterone, if approved by the FDA, will provide a safer and more effective alternative to non-FDA approved compounded bioidentical hormone therapy products, at a lower price to patients since most insurance companies do not provide coverage for non-FDA approved compounded products. We intend to work with independent and community based pharmacies that currently compound bioidentical hormone therapy products to help them transition their patients to our hormone therapy products, if approved. We launched the BIO-IGNITE™ program, an outreach program to quantify the number of compounded bio-identical estradiol and progesterone prescriptions currently dispensed by the 3,000-3,500 high-volume compounding pharmacies and qualify their interests in dispensing our hormone therapy product candidates, if approved.  As part of the BIO-IGNITE™ program, we intend to work with compounding pharmacies to identify the number of compounded estradiol and progesterone prescriptions that are directly substitutable by the two potential doses of TX-001HR, if approved, and to enter into agreements with such pharmacies to dispense our hormone therapy products in lieu of compounding, if approved.
     Multi-Channel Marketing Emphasis. We plan to continue our emphasis on large group OB/GYN practices that provide opportunities to reach large patient bases and that are receptive to the data and savings we provide. We believe this will effectively position us for the launch of our hormone therapy products, if approved.
     In addition, proliferation of digital technology has dramatically increased the amount of information to available to patients and providers putting more power in their hands. We believe this makes patient/provider engagement and experience a more important lever for life sciences companies and that providing patients and providers with important information whenever and however they want it, on a real-time basis, is a critical piece of serving this market.
       6 

     Multiple Sales Partners. We plan to continue to pursue multiple sales partners, including large chain pharmacies, independent community pharmacies, mail order and compounding and specialty pharmacies. We believe providing a higher level of customer care through unique programs targeted at each of these sales partners can produce better outcomes and value for the patient, provider and payer.
     Geographical Expansion. We currently plan to expand our geographic market and sales team to approximately 150 professionals as we commercialize our TX-001HR and TX-004HR product candidates, if approved.
     Sales and Marketing
     Although our direct national sales force is similar to that of a traditional pharmaceutical company in that sales representatives call on OB/GYN practices to provide education and sampling, we believe our sales representatives are more customer-centric in their sales approach by offering physicians more than just differences in our products from the competition; they are also able to offer physicians opportunities to assist their patients in obtaining products in a cost-effective manner.
     Our national rollout strategy has been to focus first on the largest metropolitan areas in the United States. In order to accelerate the sales ramp-up in a new territory, we employ a national sales/large practice sales effort to identify key practices in new or expanding markets. Concurrent with our provider sales effort, we work with commercial insurance payors for partnerships in which the payor can support the prescription and/or recommendation of our products for the benefit of the patient, physician, and payor, with an end result of providing better outcomes for all three constituents.
     At the forefront of our sales approach is the philosophy that the physician should recommend or prescribe products based only on what is best for the patient. In general, a better outcome is achieved by providing patients with the best products and care at the best value. We believe having an assortment of high-quality product options that can be recommended or prescribed by both the physician and payor is the foundation of providing valuable options to the patient.
     We believe our sales force has developed strong relationships in the OB/GYN market to sell our current products. We have also established relationships with some of the largest OB/GYN practices in their respective markets. By delivering additional products through the same sales channel, we believe we can leverage our already deployed assets to increase our sales and achieve profitability. We intend to leverage and grow our current marketing and sales organization to commercialize our drug candidates in the United States assuming the successful completion of the FDA regulatory process. In addition, we may partner with licensors or other strategic partners to commercialize our drug candidates outside of the OB/GYN market or in non-U.S. markets.
     Online Commerce
     A vast majority of our OTC product sales were completed online. As of January 1, 2017, we decided to focus on selling our prescription vitamins and ceased manufacturing and distributing our OTC product lines, except for Iron 21/7 which we ceased manufacturing and distributing in October 2017. The sales of discontinued products have declined steadily over time resulting in immaterial sales. As a result, as of January 1, 2017, we stopped selling our products through our websites directly to consumers.     Sales Concentration
     See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the concentration of sales of our prescription prenatal vitamin products.     Commercialization
     We cannot market or promote a new product until a marketing application has been approved by the FDA. On November 29, 2017, we resubmitted the NDA for TX-004HR with the FDA. The FDA has acknowledged that the resubmission is a complete, class 2 response to the complete response letter, or CRL, that we received on May 5, 2017 for TX-004HR. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review of the NDA for TX-004HR is May 29, 2018.
     We submitted the NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA on December 28, 2017. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.

     We believe that it will be possible for us to access the United States market through a specialty sales force. Subject to receiving marketing authorization in the United States, we expect to commence commercialization via our then-in-place sales and marketing organization. If approved, we plan to launch TX-004HR in the third quarter of 2018 and TX-001HR in 2019.
     Our Current Product Lines
     We offer a wide range of products targeted for women’s health specifically associated with pregnancy, child birth, nursing, and post-child birth. As we continue the clinical development of our hormone therapy drug candidates, we continue to manufacture and distribute our prescription prenatal vitamins product lines under our vitaMedMD® brand name and authorized generic formulations of some of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD® Prena1 name. As of January 1, 2017, we decided to focus on selling our prescription vitamins and ceased manufacturing and distributing our OTC product lines, except for Iron 21/7 which we ceased manufacturing and distributing in October 2017. The sales of discontinued products have declined steadily over time resulting in immaterial sales.
     For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 99.9%, 99.8%, and 99.5%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue was generated by our prenatal vitamin products.
     In March 2012, we launched our first prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD Plus Rx, with subsequent launches of our second prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD One Rx, in April 2012 and our third prescription prenatal vitamin, vitaMedMD RediChew™ Rx, in May 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we launched our BocaGreenMD Prena1 line of prescription prenatal vitamins, which included three prescription prenatal vitamins that were authorized generic formulations of our vitaMedMD-branded prescription prenatal vitamins. In the first quarter of 2014, we introduced a new prescription prenatal vitamin product under our branded vitaMedMD name as vitaPearl and under our authorized generic Prena1 name as Prena1 Pearl, which features a unique, proprietary combination of FOLMAX™, FePlus™, and pur-DHA™. In January 2016, we launched vitaTrue. Our current product line is detailed below.

     Our Hormone Therapy Drug Candidates
     We have submitted two NDAs with the FDA for our hormone therapy drug candidates. In December 2017, we submitted the NDA for TX-001HR, our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate, for the treatment of VMS due to menopause in menopausal women with an intact uterus. In November 2017, we re-submitted our NDA for TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia (vaginal pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. The NDA for our TX-004HR drug candidate has a PDUFA target action date of May 29, 2018, and if approved on that date, the drug candidate could be launched as early as the third quarter of 2018. If the NDA for our TX-001HR drug candidate is accepted by the FDA, it could be approved as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018 and launched in 2019.
     TX-001HR
     TX-001HR is our bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß- estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances for menopausal women with an intact uterus. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body, namely estradiol and progesterone, and is being studied as a continuous-combined regimen, in which the combination of estrogen and progesterone are taken together in one product daily. If approved by the FDA, we believe this would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone bioidentical to the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product.
     We previously conducted a pharmacokinetics, or PK, study of TX-001HR to demonstrate that our drug candidate is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug based on the criterion that the 90% confidence interval on the test-to-reference ratio is contained entirely within the interval 80% to 125%. The study compared our combined capsule TX-001HR of 2 mg estradiol and 200 mg of progesterone to 2 mg of Estrace® and 200 mg of Prometrium®.
     The study compared the mean plasma concentrations for free estradiol between TX-001HR and Estrace® in 62 female test subjects. When the results of a single dose-fed study were compared over 48 hours by the test drug versus reference drug, the ratio was 0.93 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.409 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.089. The maximum plasma concentration levels of free estradiol showed that the drug -versus -reference drug ratio was 0.88 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.344 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.040 over 48 hours.
     The study also compared the mean plasma concentrations for progesterone between TX-001HR and Prometrium® in 62 female test subjects. When the results were compared over 48 hours of the test that the drug-versus-reference drug, the ratio was 1.05 with the standard deviation within the subject being 0.956 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.542. The maximum plasma concentration levels of progesterone showed drug versus reference drug ratio as 1.16 with the standard deviation within the subject being 1.179 for an upper 95% confidence bound of -0.785 over 48 hours.
     On September 5, 2013, we began enrollment in the REPLENISH Trial, a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial of TX-001HR in menopausal women with an intact uterus. The trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy of TX-001HR for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause and the endometrial safety of TX-001HR. Patients were assigned to one of five arms, four active and one placebo, and received study medication for 12 months. The primary endpoint for the reduction of endometrial hyperplasia was an incidence of endometrial hyperplasia of less than 1% at 12 months, as determined by endometrial biopsy. The primary endpoint for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS was the mean change of frequency and severity of moderate to severe VMS at weeks four and 12 compared to placebo, as measured by the number and severity of hot flashes. Only subjects experiencing a minimum daily frequency of seven moderate to severe hot flashes at screening were included in the VMS analysis, while all subjects were included in the endometrial hyperplasia analysis. The secondary endpoints included reduction in sleep disturbances and improvement in quality of life measures, night sweats and vaginal dryness, measured at 12 weeks, six months and 12 months. The trial evaluated 1,835 patients between 40 and 65 years old at 111 sites. On December 5, 2016, we announced positive topline data for the REPLENISH Trial.
     The REPLENISH Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo; the doses studied were:
    
● | 17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416)
--+-------------------------------------------------

        9 

    
● | 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423)

● | 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421)
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | 17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424)
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Placebo (n = 151)
--+------------------

      The REPLENISH Trial results demonstrated:
     ● TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.
     ● TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.
     ● TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.
     ● The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the FDA’s draft guidance.
     As outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the REPLENISH Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks four and 12 as compared to placebo. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.
     The results of the REPLENISH Trial are summarized in the table below (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy):

     We submitted the NDA for TX-001HR with the FDA on December 28, 2017. Assuming that the NDA is accepted 74 days thereafter and an FDA review period of ten months from the receipt date to the PDUFA target action date for a non-new molecular entity, the NDA for TX-001HR could be approved by the FDA as soon as the fourth quarter of 2018.
     Symphony Health Solutions estimates that sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $588 million and the sales of estradiol and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $952 million and approximately $404 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.
     TX-002HR
     TX-002HR is a natural progesterone formulation for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea without the potentially allergenic component of peanut oil. The hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. We believe it will be similarly effective to traditional treatments, but may demonstrate efficacy at lower dosages. In January 2014, we began recruitment of patients in the SPRY Trial, a phase 3 clinical trial designed to measure the safety and effectiveness of TX-002HR in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. During the first two quarters of 2014, the SPRY Trial encountered enrollment challenges because of Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical trial protocols and FDA inclusion and exclusion criteria. In July 2014, we suspended enrollment and in October 2014 we stopped the SPRY Trial in order to update the phase 3 protocol based on discussions with the FDA. Our IND related to TX-002HR is currently in inactive status. We are considering updating the phase 3 protocol to, among other things, target only those women with secondary amenorrhea due to polycystic ovarian syndrome and to amend the primary endpoint of the trial. We believe that the updated phase 3 protocol, if proposed by us and approved by the FDA, would allow us to mitigate the enrollment challenges in, and shorten the duration of, the SPRY Trial. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will approve the updated phase 3 protocol if we propose it. We have currently suspended further development of this drug candidate to prioritize our leading drug candidates.
     TX-003HR
     TX-003HR is a natural estradiol formulation. This hormone therapy drug candidate is bioidentical to the hormones that naturally occur in a woman’s body. We currently do not have plans to further develop this hormone therapy drug candidate. Our IND related to TX-003HR is currently inactive.
     TX-004HR
     TX-004HR is our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. We believe that our drug candidate will be at least as effective as the traditional treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure, and it will have an added advantage of being a simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. We initiated the REJOICE Trial, a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trial during the third quarter of 2014 to assess the safety and efficacy of three doses – 25 mcg, 10 mcg and 4 mcg (compared to placebo) – of TX-004HR for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, or painful intercourse, as a symptom of VVA due to menopause.
     On November 10, 2015, the FDA held a scientific workshop on labeling “lower” dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA to provide an opportunity for the FDA to obtain input from experts on several topics related to the product label of lower dose estrogen-alone products approved solely for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of VVA due to menopause. According to the FDA, lower-dose estrogen products means products that contain less than the 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens used in the WHI study and estradiol products containing 0.0375 mg and below. Discussion topics at the workshop included the relevance of the boxed warnings based on data from the WHI to the lower dose estrogen-alone products; certain members in the scientific/medical community have questioned whether the boxed warnings section in the labeling, which is currently required to be included on all estrogen products, is applicable in whole or in part to these lower-dose estrogen products. The boxed warnings include: (1) an increased risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens, (2) estrogen therapy with or without progestins should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia, (3) an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in women treated with estrogen-alone, (4) an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older treated with estrogen-alone, (5) an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women treated with estrogen plus progestin, and (6) to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. It is unknown at this time what, if any, changes the FDA may propose with respect to the boxed warnings on lower dose estrogen-alone products for symptoms of VVA or whether such label changes would be applicable to TX-004HR, if approved.
     On December 7, 2015, we announced positive top-line results from the REJOICE Trial. The pre-specified four co-primary efficacy endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 12 versus placebo in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, percentage of vaginal parabasal cells, vaginal pH and severity of participants’ self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA. The trial enrolled 764 menopausal women (40 to 75 years old) experiencing moderate to severe dyspareunia at approximately 89 sites across the United States and Canada. Trial participants were randomized to receive either TX-004HR at 25 mcg (n=190), 10 mcg (n=191), or 4 mcg (n=191) doses or placebo (n=192) for a total of 12 weeks, all administered once daily for two weeks and then twice weekly (approximately three to four days apart) for ten weeks.
     The following table sets forth the statistical significance of the REJOICE Trial results for the four pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints, based on mean changes from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo.  Based on our analyses of the REJOICE Trial data, statistical significance of the results for the co-primary endpoint of severity of participants’ self-reported moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom of VVA has improved for all three doses from the results originally reported.
    
 | 25 mcg | 10 mcg | | 4 mcg
------------------------+------------+--------+------------+------
Superficial Cells | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001
Parabasal Cells | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001
Vaginal pH | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001
Severity of Dyspareunia | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001 | | P = 0.0149

        11 

     The 25 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 10 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo across all four co-primary endpoints. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR also demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoints of vaginal superficial cells, vaginal parabasal cells, and vaginal pH; the change from baseline compared to placebo in the severity of dyspareunia was statistically significant at the p = 0.0149 level. The FDA has previously indicated to us that in order to approve the drug based on a single trial, the trial would need to show statistical significance at the 0.01 level or lower for each endpoint, and that a trial that is merely statistically significant at a higher level may not provide sufficient evidence to support an NDA filing or approval of a drug candidate where the NDA relies on a single clinical trial.
     Statistical improvement over placebo was also observed for all three doses at the first assessment at week two and sustained through week 12 (see table below).
    
 | 25 mcg | 10 mcg | 4 mcg 
--------+------------+------------+-----------
Week 2 | P = 0.0105 | P = 0.0019 | P = 0.026 
Week 6 | P < 0.0001 | P = 0.0009 | P = 0.0069
Week 8 | P < 0.0001 | P < 0.0001 | P = 0.0003
Week 12 | P < 0.0001 | P < 0.0001 | P = 0.0149

      Vaginal dryness was a prespecified key secondary endpoint. The 25 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR demonstrated highly statistically significant results at the p < 0.0001 level compared to placebo for the endpoint of vaginal dryness. The 4 mcg dose of TX-004HR demonstrated statistically significant results at the p = 0.0014 level compared to placebo (see table below).
    
 | 25 mcg | | 10 mcg | | 4 mcg
----------------------------+--------+------------+--------+------------+------
Severity of Vaginal Dryness | | P < 0.0001 | | P < 0.0001 | | P = 0.0014

      The pharmacokinetic data for all three doses demonstrated negligible to very low systemic absorption of 17 beta estradiol, estrone and estrone conjugated, supporting the previous phase 1 trial data. TX-004HR was well tolerated, and there were no clinically significant differences compared to placebo-treated participants with respect to adverse events. There were no drug-related serious adverse events reported.
       We submitted the NDA for TX-004HR with the FDA on July 7, 2016. The FDA determined that the NDA was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and accepted the NDA for filing with the PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review of May 7, 2017. The NDA submission was supported by the complete TX-004HR clinical program, including positive results of the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The NDA submission included all three doses of TX-004HR (4 mcg, 10 mcg and 25 mcg) that were evaluated in the REJOICE Trial.
     On May 5, 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding the NDA for TX-004HR. In the CRL, the only approvability concern raised by the FDA was the lack of long-term safety data for TX-004HR beyond the 12 weeks studied in the phase 3 REJOICE Trial. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the efficacy of TX-004HR and did not identify any approvability issues related to chemistry, manufacturing and controls.
       12 

     On June 14, 2017, we participated in a Type A Post-Action Meeting with the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) of the FDA to discuss the CRL. At the meeting, we presented information that we believed could address concerns raised by the FDA in the CRL and positively affect the status of the NDA for TX-004HR. On July 5, 2017, we received the official minutes of the meeting from the FDA, which provided the FDA’s response to the information presented at the Type A meeting. Per the FDA’s request, we formally submitted the information presented at the Type A meeting for consideration related to the NDA for TX-004HR.
     On August 3, 2017, we received a formal General Advice Letter from the FDA stating that an initial review of this information has been completed and requesting that we submit the additional endometrial safety information to the NDA for TX-004HR on or before September 18, 2017. On September 14, 2017, we submitted the additional endometrial safety information that was requested by the FDA in the General Advice Letter to the NDA for TX-004HR. The submission included a comprehensive, systematic review of the medical literature on the use of vaginal estrogen products and the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, including the safety data from the recently published Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study, or WHI Study, of vaginal estrogen use in postmenopausal women and information on the relevance of the first uterine pass effect for low-dose vaginal estrogen products. The WHI Study demonstrated no significant difference in the risk of invasive breast cancer, stroke, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study also shows that, among women with an intact uterus, there was a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, hip fracture and all-cause mortality in vaginal estrogen users versus non-users. The WHI Study evaluated over 4,000 women who used vaginal estrogens for a median duration of two to three years.
     On November 3, 2017, we participated in an in-person meeting with DBRUP. At the meeting, DBRUP agreed to the resubmission of the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR without the need for an additional pre-approval study.
     On November 29, 2017, we resubmitted the NDA for the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of TX-004HR with the FDA. We have committed to conduct a post-approval observational study. The FDA has acknowledged that the resubmission is a complete, class 2 response to the CRL received on May 5, 2017 for TX-004HR. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review is May 29, 2018. If approved, the 4 mcg formulation of TX-004HR would represent a lower effective dose than the currently available VVA therapies approved by the FDA.
     According to Symphony Health Solutions, the total FDA-approved market for VVA treatment was approximately $1.8 billion in U.S. sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 18 issued patents, which included 13 utility patents that relate to our combination progesterone and estradiol formulations, three utility patents and one design patent that relate to TX-004HR, which establish an important intellectual property foundation for TX-004HR, one utility patent that relates to a pipeline transdermal patch technology, and one utility patent that relates to our OPERA® information technology platform.
     Preclinical Development
     Based upon leveraging our SYMBODATM hormone technology, we have four preclinical projects that include development of a progesterone-alone and combination estradiol and progesterone products in a topical cream form, which we refer to as TX-005HR and TX-006HR, respectively, and transdermal patch form, which we refer to as TX-007HR and TX-008HR, respectively. We completed a proof-of-concept preclinical study of TX-005HR in 32 rats. The study used four groups of eight female ovariectomized rats, each of whom were treated with subcutaneous injections of estradiol for eight days. On day four of treatment, they were also dosed with a placebo, subcutaneous injections of progesterone or a similar dose of TX-005HR topical progesterone cream. The results, presented at North American Menopause Society, or NAMS, meeting in October 2015, showed that the progesterone in TX-005HR penetrated the skin and opposed the effect of subcutaneous estradiol on the endometrium. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted an IND application for TX-006HR, our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate in a topical cream form, and intend to commence phase 1 clinical trials of this drug candidate as early as 2018. We may in the future engage with a financing partner to advance our topical cream and transdermal patch projects. We have recently conducted rat bioavailability studies on several novel, oral formulations of progesterone. We are currently adapting this formulation for the inclusion of estradiol and have embarked on its development as TX-009HR. In addition to menopausal treatments, we are also evaluating various other indications for our hormone technology, including contraception and premature ovarian failure.     Competition
     Pharmaceutical Industry
     The pharmaceutical industry is subject to intense competition and is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological change. Competition in our industry occurs in a variety of areas, including developing and bringing new products to market before others, developing new technologies to improve existing products, developing new products to provide the same benefits as existing products at lower cost, and developing new products to provide benefits superior to those of existing products. Most major pharmaceutical companies, as well as numerous specialty pharmaceutical companies, sell products in the women’s health sector of the pharmaceutical industry, which is comprised of products designed for post-pubescent females and is generally considered very fragmented. There are many companies focused on the women’s health sector of the pharmaceutical industry that have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, including generic manufacturers, drug compounding pharmacies, and large pharmaceutical companies. In addition, academic and other research institutions could be engaged in research and development efforts for the indications targeted by our products.

     Hormone Therapy Market
     The menopause hormone therapy market includes two major components: an FDA-approved drug market and a non-FDA approved drug market supplied by compounding pharmacies. On November 27, 2013, the DQSA became law and the FDA was given additional oversight over compounding pharmacies. In January 2018, the FDA announced the release of its 2018 Compounding Priorities Plan, which lays out how the agency will implement certain key provisions of the DQSA and other provisions of the law relevant to compounders over the course of the coming year. This plan confirms the FDA’s renewed commitment to compounding oversight and education outreach to health care professionals, all of which, we believe, will help discourage prescribing of compounded bio-identical hormones and encourage compounding pharmacies to collaborate with us.
     We believe, FDA-approved products are easily measured and monitored, while non-FDA approved hormone therapy drug products, typically referred to as “bioidenticals” when produced and sold by compounding pharmacies, are not easily measured or monitored. Our phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish an indication of the safety and efficacy of our hormone therapy drug candidates at specific dosage levels. We intend our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved by the FDA, to provide hormone therapies with well characterized safety and efficacy profiles that can be consistently manufactured to target specifications. This would provide an alternative to the non-FDA approved compounded bioidentical market. This aim is based on our belief that our drug candidates will offer advantages in terms of demonstrated safety and efficacy consistency in the hormone dose, lower patient cost due to the increased likelihood of insurance coverage and improved access as a result of availability from major retail pharmacy chains rather than custom order or formulation by individual compounders.
     TX-001HR is our combination estradiol and progesterone drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause. The combination of estradiol and progesterone for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause for menopausal women with an intact uterus is comprised of two components: the FDA-approved drug market and the non-FDA-approved compounded drug market. Symphony Health Solutions estimates that sales of FDA-approved combinations of estrogen and progestins were approximately $588 million and the sales of estradiol and progesterone on a stand-alone basis were approximately $952 million and approximately $404 million, respectively, in the United States for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017.
     The largest competitors in the FDA-approved market are Pfizer (PREMPRO), Breckenridge (generic estradiol) and Noven (CombiPatch), with sales of PREMPRO constituting a majority of such sales. None of the current FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of moderate to severe VMS due to menopause is bioidentical to both the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries. Based on various reports, including data recently presented at the NAMS Annual Meeting, “Knowledge, Use, and Prescribing of Custom-Compounded Bioidentical Hormones for Menopausal Women: It’s Not What You Think,” by JoAnn V. Pinkerton, et al., we estimate that U.S. sales of non-FDA-approved compounded combination estradiol and progesterone products approximate $1.5 billion per year. The market for non-FDA-approved compounded hormone therapy products is generally considered very fragmented because the products are prepared and sold by individual compounding pharmacies. We believe that TX-001HR, if approved by the FDA, would represent the first time a combination product of estradiol and progesterone that is bioidentical to – or having the same chemical and molecular structure as - the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovaries would be approved for use in a single combined product.
     TX-004HR is our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel drug candidate for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA in menopausal women with vaginal linings that do not receive enough estrogen. According to Symphony Health Solutions, the FDA-approved U.S. market for treatment of VVA in menopausal women was approximately $1.8 billion for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.5 billion of such sales were by three products currently on the market: Pfizer (PREMARIN cream), Allergan (ESTRACE cream) and Vagifem and its generics. We believe that TX-004HR, if approved by the FDA, will be at least as effective as the existing treatments for VVA because of an early onset of action with less systemic exposure and it will have an added advantage of being a simple, easier to use dosage form versus traditional VVA treatments. Generics for Vagifem were introduced to the market in 2017, taking significant share from Vagifem only. Generics for Estrace were approved by the FDA and are anticipated to enter the market in 2018. Also, a new product– AMAG (Intrarosa insert) – was approved by the FDA for the treatment of dyspareunia in November 2016 and was licensed for commercialization in early 2017.

     Prenatal Vitamin Market
     The prenatal vitamin market is highly fragmented, with dozens of companies selling hundreds of competitive products. Prenatal vitamin products are marketed as either OTC products or prescription products, with many companies marketing their products through both channels. According to Symphony Health Solutions, during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, approximately 6.2 million prescriptions for prenatal vitamins were issued in the United States resulting in total sales of approximately $379 million.     Seasonality
     The specialty pharmaceutical industry is not subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.
     Products in Development
     Our market objective is to develop an entire suite of products that are condition-specific and geared to the women’s health sector. Our focus is to introduce products in which we use proprietary or patented molecules or ingredients that will differentiate our products from the competition. We currently have numerous products in development, including our hormone therapy drug candidates as described above.     Manufacturing of Our Products; Availability of and Dependence Upon Suppliers; Raw Materials for Our Products
     We have sourced and qualified third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the commercial supply of our hormone therapy drug candidates that have expertise in the manufacture of soft gel capsules. The regulations for manufacturing of approved drug products are significantly more stringent than the standards for manufacturing supplements or drug product for clinical trials. Our CMOs are responsible for the manufacture of our products in accordance with our specifications and applicable regulatory requirements.  We have entered into long-term supply agreements with Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC, or Catalent, for the commercial supply of our TX-001HR and TX- 004HR hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved. Under the terms of the agreements, we will be obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of each product once we commence commercial sales of such product following regulatory approval of Catalent as a manufacturer of the product. We may terminate the agreement for a particular drug candidate in the event that we cease pursuit of regulatory approval for such drug candidate for certain specified reasons. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug candidates or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay our manufacturing and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming. The hormone therapy drug candidates used in our recently completed phase 3 clinical trials for TX-001HR and TX-004HR were manufactured by a different CMO.
     We have a multi-faceted risk management approach to ensure continuous supply from our qualified CMOs for the commercial supply of our hormone therapy products. This approach includes oversight of the manufacturing processes, regular GMP audits, a review of their business continuity plans, management of finished product inventory and safety stock, and second sourcing as appropriate.
     We have also sourced and qualified manufacturers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or APIs, to be used in our drug candidates, if approved. We follow a risk management approach for our API manufacturer similar to that followed for the commercial supply of the finished drug product.
     We use third-party manufacturers to manufacture and package our vitamin and supplement products, as well as meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.  We currently obtain approximately 100% of our vitaMedMD and BocaGreen products from Lang Pharma Nutrition, or Lang, a full-service, private label and corporate brand manufacturer specializing in premium health benefit driven products, including medical foods, nutritional supplements, beverages, bars, and functional foods in the dietary supplement category. As a result, we are dependent on Lang and its subcontractors for the manufacture of most of our vitamin and supplement products. In addition to manufacturing, Lang also provides a variety of additional services to us, including development processes, prototype development, raw materials sourcing, regulatory review, and packaging production. We believe that Lang maintains multiple supply and purchasing relationships throughout the raw materials marketplace to provide an uninterrupted supply of product to meet our manufacturing requirements.
     We have experienced no difficulties in obtaining the vitamin and supplement products we need in the amounts we require and do not anticipate those issues in the future. We believe the terms of our agreements with Lang are competitive with other suppliers and manufacturers. At present, we believe our relationship with Lang is excellent, and we intend to continue to use Lang as our third-party manufacturer for most of our vitamins and supplements.  Although we anticipate continuing our relationship with Lang, we believe that we could obtain similar terms with other suppliers to provide the same services in the event our relationship with Lang terminates. Accordingly, we do not believe that such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business.

     Quality Control for our Products
     Our products are required to be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMPs.  To approve an NDA, the FDA must assure that the proposed manufacturing facilities for our drug candidates are in compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations, which may include an FDA Pre-Approval Inspection Process, or PAI. Our third-party suppliers and manufacturers are responsible for continued compliance with cGMP requirements. We have executed Quality Agreements that delineate the responsibilities of each company in the quality assurance process. To comply with these drug commercialization standards, we have personnel with pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and quality assurance experience who are responsible for the relationships with our suppliers. We have contracted with Catalent, an established manufacturer of softgel drug products, to manufacture the commercial supply for both our TX-001HR and TX-004HR hormone therapy drug candidates. Although Catalent has received FDA Form 483 observations from FDA inspections in the past, we are not aware of any open FDA investigations into its manufacturing processes at the facilities that would be used to manufacture our products, if approved. We anticipate that as part of the PAI of our NDA for TX-004HR (or TX-001HR) the FDA may inspect Catalent’s facilities.
     The CMO that manufactured the hormone therapy drug candidates used in our recently completed phase 3 clinical trials for TX-001HR and TX-004HR was inspected by the FDA, which issued it a FDA Form 483 listing various observations, some of which pertained to the clinical supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR drug candidates. The CMO has submitted its written response to the Form 483 observations to the FDA, which we believe will satisfactorily address the FDA’s observations with respect to the clinical supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR drug candidates. We do not believe that the observations made by the FDA with respect to the CMO will have a material adverse effect on the FDA’s review of our NDA for TX-004HR or the timing of our anticipated submission of an NDA for TX-001HR. We believe the inspection was not conducted as part of the FDA’s review of our NDA for TX-004HR. As noted above, we have contracted with a different CMO, Catalent, to provide the commercial supply of our TX-001HR and TX- 004HR hormone therapy drug candidates.
     Our quality assurance team establishes controls that are designed to document the manufacturing process and ensure that our contract manufacturers meet product specifications and that our finished products contain the correct ingredients, purity, strength, and composition in compliance with FDA regulations. Our contractors test incoming raw materials and finished goods to ensure they meet or exceed FDA and U.S. Pharmacopeia standards (when applicable), including quantitative and qualitative assay and microbial and heavy metal contamination (as appropriate).
     Distribution of our Products
     During the third quarter of 2016, we centralized the distribution channel for both our retail pharmacy distributors and wholesale distributors, in order to facilitate sales to a broader population of retail pharmacies. In addition to third-party logistics providers, we use some of the same national and regional distributors as other pharmaceutical companies, including Cardinal, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, H.D. Smith, and Smith Drug. Wholesaler product inventory is monitored daily and sales out is monitored weekly. National and regional retail pharmacies are also an area of focus to make sure our products are purchased and dispensed properly.
     Customer Service
     Our goal is 100% customer satisfaction by consistently delivering superior customer experiences before, during, and after the sale. To achieve this goal, we maintain a fully-staffed customer care center that uses current customer relationship management software to respond to health care providers, pharmacies, and consumers. We believe our customer service initiatives allow us to establish and maintain long-term customer relationships and facilitate repeat visits and purchases. We also facilitate repeat customer orders through our auto-ship feature.
     Our representatives receive regular training so that they can effectively and efficiently field questions from current and prospective customers and are also trained not to answer questions that should be directed to a customer’s physician. Having a quality customer care center allows our representatives to provide an array of valuable data in the areas of sales, market research, quality assurance, lead generation, and customer retention.
     Our Return Policy
     We sell our prescription products through third-party logistics providers, wholesale distributors, and retail pharmacy distributors, all of whom may return a product within six months prior to and twelve months after the expiration date of the product. Once customers buy a prescription product from the pharmacy, the product may not be returned.

     Our Quality Guarantee
     We proudly stand behind the quality of our products. We believe our guarantee makes it easy, convenient, and safe for customers to purchase our products. Under our quality guarantee, we:
● | ensure the potency and quality of our vitamin products; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | help health care providers and payors by delivering information on patient compliance and satisfaction.

      We value frequent communication with and feedback from our customers in order to continue to improve our offerings and services.
     Research and Development
     Our product development programs are concentrated in the area of advanced hormone therapy pharmaceutical products. We engage in programs to provide alternatives to the FDA and non-FDA-approved compounded bioidentical market for hormone therapy. Our programs seek to bring new products to market in unique delivery systems or formats that enhance the effectiveness, safety, and reliability of existing hormone therapy alternatives.
     We intend for our hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, to provide an alternative to the non-FDA-approved compounded bioidentical market based on our belief that our drug candidates will offer advantages in terms of proven safety, efficacy, and stability, lower patient cost as a result of insurance coverage, and improved access as a result of availability from major retail pharmacy chains rather than custom order or formulation by individual compounders.
     Our research and development expenses were approximately $33.9 million in 2017, $53.9 million in 2016, and $72.0 million in 2015.
     Intellectual Property
     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property portfolio is one of the means by which we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are diligently seeking ways to protect our intellectual property through various legal mechanisms in relevant jurisdictions.
     We also have numerous pending foreign and domestic patent applications. As of December 31, 2017, we had 18 issued domestic, or U.S., patents and 13 issued foreign patents, including:
    
● | 13 domestic and three foreign utility patents that relate to our combination progesterone and estradiol product candidates, which are owned by us. The domestic utility patents will expire in 2032. In addition, we have pending patent applications with respect to our combination progesterone and estradiol product candidates in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | three domestic and 10 foreign patents that relate to TX-004HR, our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel product candidate. These patents establish an important intellectual property foundation for TX-004HR and are owned by us. These domestic patents will expire in 2033 or 2032. In addition, we have pending patent applications related to our applicator-free vaginal estradiol softgel product candidate in the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and South Korea;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one domestic utility patent that relates to a pipeline transdermal patch technology, which is owned by us and will expire in 2032. We have pending patent applications with respect to this technology in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Mexico, Japan, and South Africa; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one utility patent that relates to our OPERA® information-technology platform, which is owned by us and is a domestic patent that will expire in 2029.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As of December 31, 2017, we had filed 46 nonprovisional and 33 provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, with respect to our technology or our hormone therapy drug candidates, including issued patents, and 123 international patent applications with respect to our technology or our hormone therapy drug candidates, including Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and national stage filings.
     We hold multiple U.S. trademark registrations and have numerous pending trademark applications. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark; however, it is subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all of the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life so long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe our patents and trademarks are valuable and provide us certain benefits in marketing our products.
       17 

     We intend to actively protect our intellectual property with patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or other legal avenues for the protection of intellectual property and to aggressively prosecute, enforce, and defend our patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of any one patent may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing on validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to account for patent rights of third parties.
     OPERA is our patented information technology platform used in our business. We believe the deployment of OPERA and the further development and deployment of related technology creates a sustainable competitive advantage in clinical development and product improvement.
     As we continue to develop proprietary intellectual property, we will expand our protection by applying for patents on future technologies. As we examine our current product offerings and new product pipeline, we are in the process of modifying and developing new formulations that will enable us to gain patent protection for these products.
     While we seek broad coverage under our patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, patents expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending application or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
     Government Regulation
     In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including federal and state consumer protection laws, laws protecting the privacy of health-related information, and laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and trade practices.     Pharmaceutical Regulation
     The process required by the FDA before a new drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
    
● | completion of or reference to extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND application under which the holder may begin conducting human clinical trials, provided that the FDA does not object; the IND must be updated annually; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; and 
● | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials. 

      An IND application is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. We have submitted five INDs for our hormone therapy drug candidates. The INDs for TX-002HR and TX-003HR are currently on inactive status. The INDs for TX-004HR, TX-001HR, and TX-006HR remain active.
     Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in the clinical trial. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed and re-assess and approve the study at least annually. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
     Clinical trials are usually conducted in three phases. Phase 1 clinical trials are normally conducted in small groups of healthy volunteers to assess safety, characterize pharmacokinetics, and assist in finding the potential dosing range. After phase 1, the drug is administered to small populations of patients (phase 2) to look for initial signs of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or condition and to continue to assess dosing and safety. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually multi-center, double-blind controlled trials in hundreds or even thousands of subjects at various sites to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug.
       18 

     During the course of a clinical trial, we are required to inform the FDA and the IRB about adverse events associated with our drug candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group reviews unblinded data from clinical trials and provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climates.
     Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things.
     Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months of filing or 12 months of receipt for a new molecular entity. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
     After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities in which the drug product will be formulated and its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or, instead, a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
     After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we would be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long-term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive, and record keeping requirements. For example, Catalent, the CMO that we have contracted with for the commercial supply of our TX-001HR and TX-004HR hormone therapy drug candidates, if approved, was issued a Form FDA-483 in 2016 with respect to its softgel manufacturing plant that will be used for the manufacture of the commercial supply of TX-001HR and TX- 004HR, if approved.  The corrective actions identified in Catalent’s response to the Form FDA 483 have been completed and we are not aware of any open FDA investigations into Catalent’s manufacturing processes at this facility.
     In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
     We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our drug candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
       19 

     Our hormone therapy drug candidates may compete with unapproved hormone therapy products supplied by compounding pharmacies. Pharmacy compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist combines, mixes, or alters ingredients in response to a prescription to create a medication tailored to the medical needs of an individual patient. The medications created by the compounding pharmacy are theoretically “new drugs” that would otherwise be subject to the new drug approval requirements of the FDCA.
     However, for approximately 50 years, the FDA left regulation of compounding pharmacies to the states. In 1992, in response to various safety concerns, the FDA issued a Compliance Policy Guide, which announced that the “FDA may, in the exercise of its enforcement discretion, initiate federal enforcement actions...when the scope and nature of a pharmacy’s activities raises the kinds of concerns normally associated with a manufacturer and...results in significant violations of the new drug, adulteration, or misbranding provisions of the Act.” Thereafter, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, which sought to clarify FDA’s regulatory authority over compounding pharmacies. FDAMA exempted “compounded drugs” from the FDA’s standard drug approval requirements as long as the providers of those drugs abide by several restrictions, including that they refrain from advertising or promoting particular compounded drugs. In 2002, though, the Supreme Court declared this provision of FDAMA to be unconstitutional under the First Amendment, effectively re-instating the pre-FDAMA regime. Shortly thereafter, the FDA issued its 2002 Compliance Policy Guide 460.200, which states that the FDA will exercise enforcement discretion to exclude compounded drugs from the new drug approval requirements except where compounding pharmacies act more akin to traditional drug manufacturers.
     To further clarify the FDA’s jurisdiction, Congress enacted and the President signed into law the DQSA, which among other things, formalized the relationship between the FDA and compounding pharmacies by exempting compounding pharmacy products from the FDA approval requirements and the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, but not the exemption from cGMP requirements. To qualify for this exemption, a compounding pharmacy must register with the FDA as an “outsourcing facility,” subject to FDA inspection and other requirements. The FDA does not exercise the same authority to regulate compounding pharmacies as pharmaceutical manufacturers. For example, compounding pharmacies are not required to report adverse events associated with compounded drugs, while commercial drug manufacturers are subject to stringent regulatory reporting requirements.
     505(b)(2) Application
     We submitted two NDAs for our hormone therapy drug candidates, TX-004HR and TX-001HR, assuming that the clinical data justify submission, under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or Section 505(b)(2). Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA when at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which a referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
     As part of our NDA submission, we intend to certify that all of the patents for approved products referenced in the NDA for each of the hormone therapy drug candidates as listed in the FDA’s Orange Book have expired and that we will not be compelled to certify that any patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the new products. If, in fact, this assessment is incorrect, it can have a serious and significant adverse effect on our ability to obtain FDA approval or market our new products. If we are compelled to certify that a patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, then the holder of that patent can initiate a patent infringement suit against us and the FDA is precluded from approving our product for 30 months or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier.
     Marketing Exclusivity
     A Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as a three-year exclusivity. The first approved Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant for a particular condition, or change to a marketed product, such as a new extended release formulation for a previously approved product, may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted or sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the marketing product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. Additional exclusivities may also apply.
       20 

     Additionally, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may have relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if it does, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against those applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants.
     Dietary Supplement Regulation
     Our currently marketed products are regulated as dietary supplements. The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of these products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold.
     Generally, our nutritional product formulations are proprietary in that in designing them, we attempt to blend an optimal combination of nutrients that appear to have beneficial impact based upon scientific literature and input from physicians; however, we are generally prohibited from making disease treatment and prevention claims in the promotion of our products that use these formulations.
     The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, amended the FDCA to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing, and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDCA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient. The FDA recently issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. FDA guidance is not mandatory and companies are free to use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. However, FDA guidance is a strong indication of the FDA’s “current thinking” on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. The draft guidance on new dietary ingredients is expected to be significantly revised when published in final form. Moreover, Congress can amend the dietary supplement provisions of the FDCA to impose additional restrictions on labeling and marketing of dietary supplements. Such action would have material adverse impact on our business and growth prospects.
     The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that in its determination present an unreasonable health risk to consumers that would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients in such products. Such actions or warnings could be based on information received through FDCA-mandated reporting of serious adverse events. The FDCA requires that reports of serious adverse events be submitted to the FDA, and based in part on such reports, the FDA has issued public warnings to consumers to stop using certain third party dietary supplement products.
     The FDCA permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without premarket approval. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function, or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function, or well-being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim, conventional food claim, or an unauthorized version of a “health claim,” or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we would be prevented from using the claim.
     In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” such as a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. The literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter; (4) if displayed in establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or another method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.
       21 

     In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FDCA as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed cGMP regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA is conducting inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, which was enacted on January 2, 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements are subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which has the potential to increase the costs of dietary ingredients and subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA also requires importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements.
     The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue public Warning Letters or Untitled Letters to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, request a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request that the Department of Justice initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U.S. courts. The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.
     The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and cosmetics. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases, including promotional offers of savings compared policies, telemarketing, continuity plans, and “free” offers.
     We are also subject to regulation under various state, local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of dietary supplements and drugs. For example, Proposition 65 in the state of California is a list of substances deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a dietary supplement, cosmetic, or drug, the product may be lawfully sold in California only if accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth defect risk. Private attorney general actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant parties and can result in substantial costs and fines.
     Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
     We are also subject to additional health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations include the following:
● | The federal health care anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, and its corresponding regulations, prohibit physicians from referring patients for designated health services, including outpatient drugs, reimbursed under the Medicare or Medicaid programs to entities with which the physicians or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest, subject to narrow regulatory exceptions, and prohibits those entities from submitting claims to Medicare or Medicaid for payment of items or services provided to a referred beneficiary.
● | The federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment involving federally funded programs that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money with respect to a federal program. 

        22 

    
● | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with any mater within the jurisdiction of the federal government, including the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. 
● | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government.

      Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable health care laws and regulations could be costly. Although we believe that our business practices are structured to be compliant with applicable laws, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other health care laws and regulations. If our past or present operations, including activities conducted by our sales team or agents, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from third party payor programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians, providers, or entities with whom we do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusion from government funded health care programs.
     Many aspects of these laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations that increases the risk of potential violations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation.
     In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the FTC, or by other federal, state, local, or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable, such as DSHEA, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals, or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel, or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
     The growth and demand for eCommerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online retailers. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business. There is currently great uncertainty in many states whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, and libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online retailers. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or a change in application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
     Employees
     As of December 31, 2017, we had 173 full time employees, six of whom are executive officers. Additionally, from time to time, we hire temporary contract employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we are unaware of any union organizing efforts. We have never experienced a major work stoppage, strike, or dispute. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

     Our History
     On October 3, 2011, we changed our name to TherapeuticsMD, Inc. On October 4, 2011, we closed a reverse merger with VitaMedMD pursuant to which (1) all outstanding membership units of VitaMed were exchanged for shares of our common stock, (2) all outstanding VitaMed options and warrants were exchanged and converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and (3) VitaMed became our wholly owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2011, we determined that VitaMed would become the sole focus of our company and services previously performed relative to the licensing agreement discussed in the following paragraph were discontinued.
     We were incorporated in Utah in 1907 under the name Croff Mining Company, or Croff. Prior to 2008, Croff’s operations consisted entirely of oil and natural gas leases. Due to a spin-off of its operations in December 2007, Croff had no business operations or revenue source and had reduced its operations to a minimal level although it continued to file reports required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. As a result of the spin-off, Croff was a “shell company” under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. In July 2009, Croff (i) closed a transaction to acquire America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary, (ii) ceased being a shell company, and (iii) experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. acquired control of our company. On June 11, 2010, we closed a transaction to acquire Spectrum Health Network, Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. On July 20, 2010, we filed Articles of Conversion and Articles of Incorporation to redomicile in the state of Nevada. On July 31, 2010, we transferred the assets of America’s Minority Health Network, Inc. to a secured noteholder in exchange for the satisfaction of certain associated debt. On February 15, 2011, we transferred the assets of Spectrum Health Network, Inc. to a secured noteholder in exchange for the satisfaction of associated debt and in exchange for a licensing agreement under which we subsequently sold subscription services and advertising on the Spectrum Health Network for commissions.
