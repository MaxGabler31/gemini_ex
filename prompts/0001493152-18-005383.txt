ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the “Company”) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels, and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC (“AMG Renewables”), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group, LLC (“AMG Energy”), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest in Carbolosic, LLC (“Carbolosic”). Carbolosic holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida’s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428) known as “CTS™.” The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company’s goal in acquiring the interest in AMG Energy was to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company’s resources and personnel on the Company’s renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries. Effective December 5, 2014, amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc., which more appropriately describes the Company’s new business direction.
 
In December 2014, AMG Energy formed EK Laboratories, Inc. (originally, Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc.) (“EK”), to serve as a demonstration and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies. EK remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG Energy.
 
In July 2016, the Company determined to restructure its energy holdings under a single wholly-owned subsidiary (AMG Energy) such that AMG Energy would own (i) the Company’s fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic (which includes certain licensing rights in North America and Africa) and (ii) the Company’s 100% interest in EK Laboratories, LLC. This restructuring was completed on September 19, 2016 when AMG Renewables merged into AMG Energy. Previously, the Company had completed transactions with certain related parties to acquire the remaining 49% of AMG Energy, which was not owned by the Company, in exchange for an aggregate of 10,240,094 shares of Company common stock and a restructuring of the balance due under a cash payable to the minority AMG Energy Shareholders.

The Company is now focused on the development and commercialization of the licensed technology it controls through its affiliate Carbolosic, LLC. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AMG Energy, the Company owns Ek Laboratories, Inc. and a 50% interest in Carbolosic (which includes certain licensing rights in North America and Africa).
 
The Company has a strategy that includes mergers and acquisitions of existing businesses in the renewable energy and sustainable products industries as well as sublicensing its patented technologies that it controls through a master license with the University of Central Florida under affiliate Carbolosic and start-up activities which are focused on development of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value.
 
In February 2017, the Company formed Alliance Bio-Products, Inc., a Florida corporation (“ABIOP”), for the purpose of acquiring and operating a plant for the installation of the Company’s patented CTS process. The Company intends to raise money into ABIOP for this purpose.
 
The Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the development of technologies from concept to commercialization as well as the bio-fuels, renewable energy, chemical manufacturing and engineering and industrial construction industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its business.
