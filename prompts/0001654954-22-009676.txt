The variation in the proportionate share of each product line for each period reflects changes emanating from: demand, Congressional appropriations, the process and timing associated with awards of defense contracts, shifts in technology and consolidation of defense prime contractors. The Company’s microelectronic products can be classified as active electronic components. Active electronic components are those that control and direct the flow of electrical power by means of a control signal such as a voltage or current. 

It is customary to subdivide active electronic components into those of a discrete nature and those which are non‑discrete. Discrete devices contain a single microelectronic element; and non-discrete devices consist of integrated circuits or hybrid circuits, which contain two or more elements, either active or passive, that are interconnected to make up an electrical circuit. An integrated circuit incorporates various active and passive elements into a single silicon chip. A hybrid circuit, on the other hand, comprises a number of individual components that are mounted onto a suitable surface material, interconnected by various means, and suitably encapsulated. Hybrid and integrated circuits can be analog or digital; presently, the Company manufactures analog components. The Company’s products are either standard devices, such as catalog type items (e.g., transistors and voltage regulators), or application‑specific devices, also referred to as custom or semi‑custom products. The latter are designed and manufactured to meet a customer’s particular requirements. For each of the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, approximately 86% of the Company’s sales have been of custom products, and the remaining 14% have been of standard or catalog products. 


3


Approximately 90% of the semiconductor components produced by the Company are manufactured pursuant to approved Source Control Drawings (“SCD”) from the United States government and/or its prime contractors; the remainder are primarily JAN qualified products approved for use by the military. The Company’s semiconductor products are used as components of military, commercial, and aerospace electronic equipment, such as ground and airborne radar systems, power distribution systems, missiles, missile control systems, satellites, and space applications. The Company’s products have been used on the space shuttle and on the space missions to the moon, to Jupiter (on Galileo), and to Mars (on Global Surveyor and Mars Sojourner). For the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, approximately 85% and 77%, respectively, of the Company’s sales have been attributable to contracts with customers whose products are sold to the United States government. The remaining 15% and 23%, respectively of sales are for non-military, scientific and industrial applications, or to distributors where we do not have end user information. 

Custom products are typically sold to the United States government and defense or aerospace companies, such as Raytheon Technologies Corporation, Lockheed Martin, L3Harris Technologies, General Electric Aviation, Honeywell International, and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, while standard products are sold to the same customer base and to the general electronic industry. The Company has standard and custom products available in all of its major product lines.

The following is a general description of the principal product lines manufactured by the Company.

Power Transistors

Power transistors are high current and/or high voltage control devices commonly used for active gain applications in electronic circuits. The Company manufactures a large variety of power bipolar transistors for applications requiring currents in the range of 0.1A to 300A or voltages in the range of 30V to 1000V. The Company employs over 60 types of silicon chips to manufacture over 500 types of power bipolar transistors and is currently expanding this line in response to increased market demand resulting from other companies’ departure from the military market. The Company also manufactures power diodes under the same military specification. The Company is qualified to deliver these products under MIL-PRF-19500 in accordance with JAN, JANTX and JANTXV. JAN, JANTX AND JANTXV denotes various quality military screening levels. The Company manufactures both standard and custom power transistors. Additionally, it manufactures power N‑Channel and P‑Channel MOSFET transistors and is continuously expanding that line in accordance with customers’ requirements.

The Company has been certified and qualified since 1968 under MIL-PRF-19500 (and its predecessor) standards promulgated by the Defense Supply Center Columbus (“DSCC”). These standards specify the uniformity and quality of bipolar transistors and diodes purchased for United States military programs. The purpose of the program is to standardize the documentation and testing for bipolar semiconductors for use in United States military and aerospace applications. Attainment of certification and/or qualification to MIL-PRF-19500 requirements is important since it is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to be selected to supply bipolar semiconductors for defense-related purposes. MIL-PRF-19500 establishes specific criteria for manufacturing construction techniques and materials used for bipolar semiconductors and assures that these types of devices will be manufactured under conditions that have been demonstrated to be capable of continuously producing highly reliable products. This program requires a manufacturer to demonstrate its products’ performance capabilities. A manufacturer receives certification once its Product Quality Assurance Program Plan is reviewed and approved by DSCC. A manufacturer receives qualification once it has demonstrated that it can build and test a sample product in conformity with its certified Product Quality Assurance Program Plan. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of MIL-PRF-19500 qualification will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. The Company continues to expand its power transistor product offering.

Hybrids

Hybrids are compact electronic circuits that contain passive and active components mounted on thick film printed substrates and encapsulated in appropriate packages. The Company manufactures thick film hybrids, which generally contain discrete semiconductor chips, integrated circuits, chip capacitors and thick film or thin film resistors. Most of the hybrids are of the high-power type and are custom manufactured for military and aerospace systems. Some of the Company’s hybrids include high power voltage regulators, power amplifiers, power drivers, boosters and controllers. The Company manufactures both standard and custom hybrids.

The Company has been certified (since 1990) and qualified (since 1995) under MIL-PRF-38534 Class H (and its predecessor) standards promulgated by the DSCC. These standards specify the uniformity and quality of hybrid products purchased for United States military programs. The purpose of the program is to standardize the documentation and testing for hybrid microcircuits for use in United States military and aerospace applications. Attainment of certification and/or qualification under MIL-PRF-38534 Class H requirements is important since it is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to be selected to supply hybrids for defense-related purposes. MIL-PRF-38534 Class H establishes definite criteria for manufacturing techniques and materials used for hybrid microcircuits and assures that these types of devices will be manufactured under conditions that have been demonstrated to be capable of continuously producing highly reliable products. This program requires a manufacturer to demonstrate its products’ performance capabilities. Certification is a prerequisite of qualification. A manufacturer receives certification once its Product Quality Assurance Program Plan is reviewed and approved by DSCC. A manufacturer receives qualification once it has demonstrated that it can build and test a sample product in conformity with its certified Product Quality Assurance Program Plan. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of MIL-PRF-38534 Class H qualification will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. 

Voltage Regulators

Voltage regulators provide the power required to activate electronic components such as the integrated circuits found in all electronic devices from radar and missile systems to smart phones.

Power MOSFETs

Power MOSFETs perform the same function as bipolar transistors except that power MOSFETs are current controlled and bipolar transistors are voltage controlled. MOSFETs are popular due to their high input impedance, fast switching speed, and resistance to thermal runaway and secondary breakdown. Power MOSFETs are available in very high voltage and current ratings.

Field Effect Transistors

Field effect transistors are surface-controlled devices where conduction of electrical current is controlled by the electrical potential applied to a capacitively coupled control element. The Company manufactures about 30 different types of junction field effect transistor chips. They are used to produce over 350 different field effect transistor types. Most of the Company’s field effect transistors conform to standard Joint Electronic Device Engineering Council designated transistors, commonly referred to with standard 2N designation numbers. The Company continues to expand its field effect transistor product offering. The Company manufactures both standard and custom field effect transistors.
MANUFACTURING

The Company’s engineers design its transistors, diodes, field effect transistors and hybrids, as well as other customized products, based upon requirements established by customers, with the cooperation of the Company’s product and marketing personnel. The design of standard or catalog products is based on specific industry standards.

Each new design is first produced on a CAD/CAE (Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering) computer system. The design layout is then reduced to the desired geometry and transferred to silicon wafers in a series of steps that include photolithography, chemical or plasma etching, oxidation, diffusion and metallization. The wafers then go through a fabrication process. When the process is completed, each wafer contains a large number of silicon chips, each chip being a single transistor device or a single diode. The wafers are tested using a computerized test system prior to being separated into individual chips. The chips are then assembled in standard or custom packages, incorporated in hybrids or sold as chips to other companies. The chips are normally mounted inside a chosen package using eutectic, solder or epoxy die attach techniques, and then wire bonded to the package pins using gold or aluminum wires. Many of the packages are manufactured by the Company and, in most cases, the Company plates its packages with gold, nickel or other metals utilizing outside vendors to perform the plating operation. In the case of hybrids, design engineers formulate the circuit layout designs. Ceramic substrates are then printed with thick film gold conductors to form the interconnect pattern and with thick film resistive inks to form the resistors of the designed circuit. Semiconductor chips, resistor chips, capacitor chips and inductors are then mounted on the substrates and sequential wire bonding is used to interconnect the various components to the printed substrate, as well as to connect the circuit to the package's external pins.

In addition to Company-performed testing and inspection procedures, certain of the Company’s products are subject to source inspections required by customers (including the United States Government). In such cases, designated inspectors are authorized to perform a detailed on-premise inspection of each individual device prior to encapsulation in a casing or before dispatch of the finished unit to ensure that the quality and performance of the product meets the prescribed specifications. 

ISO 9001 and AS9100

The Company is certified by NQA to AS 9100:2016 (sometimes previously referred to as AS 9100D) and ISO 9001:2015 standards. The certification is valid until September 2022 and was reissued on August 31, 2018 for the cycle starting September 8, 2018. The AS 9100 certification defines a Quality Management System that is oriented to the aerospace industry. It was released in 1999 by the European Association of Aerospace Industries along with the Society of Automotive Engineers. AS 9100 encompasses ISO 9001 requirements so the certification to AS 9100 standards includes ISO 9001 standards. It is broadly accepted or endorsed as a requirement for aerospace manufacturers among many Solitron customers.

MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS

During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, Raytheon Technologies Corporation accounted for approximately 47% of net sales, USI Electronics 13% of net sales, L3Harris 15% of net sales, and Honeywell 11% of net sales, as compared to 49%, 15%, and 11%, and less than 10%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. Seven of the Company’s customers accounted for approximately 92% of the Company’s net sales during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022, as compared to nine customers accounting for 92% of net sales for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. It has been the Company’s experience that a large percentage of its sales have been attributable to a relatively small number of customers in any particular period. Due to mergers and acquisitions activity in general, and among large defense contractors in particular, the number of large customers will most likely continue to decline in number, but this does not necessarily mean that the Company will experience a decline in sales. As a result, the Company expects customer concentration to continue. The loss of any major customer without offsetting orders from other sources could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

Sales to foreign customers accounted for less than 1% of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021. All sales to foreign customers are conducted utilizing exclusively U.S. dollars. See Note 10 of the financial statements for more information regarding export sales to customers.

BACKLOG

The Company’s order backlog, which consists of semiconductor and hybrid related open orders, was approximately $4,464,000 at February 28, 2022, as compared to $9,150,000 at February 28, 2021. Approximately 71% of the backlog is scheduled for delivery within twelve months. For the years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, the entire backlog consisted of orders for electronic components. 

The Company’s backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period because lead times for the release of purchase orders depend upon the scheduling practices of individual customers. The delivery times of new or non-standard products can be affected by scheduling factors and other manufacturing considerations, variances in the rate of booking new orders from month to month and the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations of orders. Also, delivery times of new or non-standard products are affected by the availability of raw material, scheduling factors, manufacturing considerations and customer delivery requirements.

The rate of booking new orders varies significantly from month to month, mostly as a result of sharp fluctuations in the government budgeting and appropriation process. The Company has historically experienced somewhat decreased levels of bookings during the summer months, primarily as a result of such budgeting and appropriation activities. For these reasons, and because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations of orders, the Company’s backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Bookings and Backlog.”

PATENTS AND LICENSES

The Company historically owned 33 patents (all of which have now expired or have been allowed to lapse) relating to the design and manufacture of its products. The expirations or lapses of these patents have not had a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes that engineering standards, manufacturing techniques and product reliability are more important to the successful manufacture and sale of its products than the expired or lapsed patents it held. 
COMPETITION

The electronic component industry, in general, is highly competitive and has been characterized by price erosion, rapid technological changes and foreign competition. However, in the market segments in which the Company operates, while highly competitive and subject to the same price erosion, technological change is slow and minimal. The Company believes that it is well regarded by its customers in the segments of the market in which competition is dependent less on price and more on product reliability, performance and service. Management believes, however, that to the extent the Company’s business is targeted at the military and aerospace markets, where there has been virtually no foreign competition, it is subjected to less competition than manufacturers of commercial electronic components. Additionally, the decline in military orders in programs the Company participates in and the shift in the requirement of the Defense Department whereby the use of Commercial Off The Shelf (“COTS”) components is encouraged over the use of high reliability components that the Company manufactures, prompting the number of competitors to decline, afford the Company the opportunity to increase its market share. In the non-military, non-aerospace markets, the Company is subject to greater price erosion and foreign competition. 

The Company has numerous competitors across all of its product lines. The Company is not in direct competition with any other semiconductor manufacturer for an identical mixture of products; however, one or more of the major manufacturers of semiconductors manufacture some of the Company’s products. Other competitors in the military market include Infineon Technologies, Microsemi Corporation, Anaren, Inc., Natel Engineering Company and Sensitron Semiconductor. The Company competes principally on the basis of product quality, turn-around time, customer service and price. The Company believes that competition for sales of products that will ultimately be sold to the United States Government has intensified and will continue to intensify as United States defense spending on high reliability components continues to decrease and the Department of Defense pushes for implementation of its 1995 decision to purchase COTS standard products in lieu of products made in accordance with more stringent military specifications. 

The Company believes that its primary competitive advantage is its ability to produce high quality products as a result of its years of experience, its sophisticated technologies and its experienced staff. The Company believes that its ability to produce highly reliable custom hybrids in a short period of time will give it a strategic advantage in attempting to penetrate high-end commercial markets and in selling military products complementary with those currently sold, as doing so would enable the Company to produce products early in design and development cycles. 

The Company believes that it will be able to improve its capability to respond more quickly to customer needs and deliver products ahead of schedule.

EMPLOYEES

At February 28, 2022, the Company had 58 employees, 33 of whom were engaged in production activities, 4 in sales and marketing, 7 in executive and administrative capacities and 14 in technical and support activities. Of the 58 employees, 54 were full time employees and 4 were part time employees. 

The Company has never had a work stoppage, and none of its employees are represented by a labor organization. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL 

The Company purchases its raw materials from multiple suppliers and has a minimum of two suppliers for most of its material requirements. The largest supplier in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2022 was Platronics Seals, representing 25% of total purchases. Other suppliers that represented more than 10% of total purchases were Wuxi Streamtek, which accounted for 22% of total purchases, and Stellar Industries, which accounted for 12% of total purchases. The largest supplier in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 was Egide USA, representing 18% of total purchases. Other suppliers that represented more than 10% of total purchases were Wuxi Streamtek, which accounted for 13% of total purchases, SemiDice, which accounted for 10% of total purchases, and CPS Technologies, which accounted for 10% of total purchases. Because of a diminishing number of sources for components and packages in particular, and the increase in the prices of raw silicon semiconductor wafers, precious metals and gold (used in the finish of the packages), the Company has been obliged to pay higher prices, which results in higher costs of goods sold. Most of the packages the Company uses are gold plated, thus they are subject to the volatility and cost fluctuations of gold. 
EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The Company has received DSCC approval to supply its products in accordance with MIL-PRF-19500 and Class H of MIL-PRF-38534. These qualifications are required of vendors to supply to the United States Government or its prime contractors. The Company expects that its continued maintenance of these qualifications will continue to improve its business posture by increasing product marketability. The Company is also certified in accordance with AS9100 which is a core requirement of most defense aerospace contracts.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

During the fiscal years ended February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2021, the Company spent $124,000 and $122,000, respectively, of its own funds on research and development. The Company may decide to increase research and development expenditures in the future. The cost of designing custom products has historically been borne in full by the customer, either as a direct charge or is amortized in the unit price charged to the customer.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

While the Company believes that it has the environmental permits necessary to conduct its business and that its operations conform to current environmental regulations, increased public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor manufacturing operations. The Company, in the conduct of its manufacturing operations, has handled and does handle materials that are considered hazardous, toxic or volatile under federal, state and local laws and, therefore, is subject to regulations related to their use, storage, discharge and disposal. No assurance can be made that the risk of accidental release of such materials can be completely eliminated. In the event of a violation of environmental laws, the Company could be held liable for damages and the costs of remediation. In addition, the Company, along with the rest of the semiconductor industry, is subject to variable interpretations and governmental priorities concerning environmental laws and regulations. The annual cost of complying with the regulations is minimal.

Environmental statutes have been interpreted to provide for joint and several liability and strict liability regardless of actual fault. There can be no assurance that the Company and its subsidiaries will not be required to incur costs to comply with, or that the operations, business or financial condition of the Company will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations.
