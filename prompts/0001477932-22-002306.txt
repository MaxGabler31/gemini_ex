Evolution of Trident Brands

Brands

On March 1, 2015, we acquired, through a licensing agreement with DSM Nutritional Products LLC (“DNP”), the exclusive global rights to Brain Armor® dietary supplements, a plant-based DHA supplement designed specifically for the needs of athletes. At the same time, a wholly-owned subsidiary, Brain Armor Incorporated was registered to hold the trademark license and commercially develop the Brain Armor® brand. As per the agreement, DNP was to be the sole source of the Company’s omega-3 oil requirements which will be DNP’s life’s DHATM oil and will supply the soft gel capsules in finished form to us. In order to maintain exclusivity to the license, we were required to meet certain targets with respect to product launches and sales volume. Also under the terms of the agreement we had the opportunity to exercise an option to purchase the Brain Armor(R) dietary supplement brand. The term of the Agreement and the license rights was for five (5) years and shall be subject to successive one (1) year automatic renewal periods, assuming all performance milestones had been met. On December 22, 2017, the Company purchased the trademark and the proprietary formulations at a cost of $400,000, effectively terminating the license agreement of 2015. The Company has since developed and improved its own formulations.

On January 28, 2016, we issued 3,000,000 common shares pursuant to a Deed of Assignment dated effective January 20, 2015 among our Company, Oceans Omega LLC, and the assignor 2298107 Ontario Inc., pursuant to which the assignor assigned to our Company the assignor’s non-exclusive rights to purchase, market, sell and distribute certain Omega 3 nutritional emulsions produced by Oceans Omega LLC to the food and beverage industries and exclusive rights to purchase, market, sell and distribute to the global meat industry.

In April 2019, Trident began shipping Brain Armor dietary supplement products to CVS Health; in July 2020 to Whole Foods Markets through United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI), a national distributor; and in June 2020 to US supplement retailer Vitamin Shoppe. All of these retail listings were under standard vendor trading agreement terms. All these retail agreements have since been terminated due to the Company’s inability to purchase inventory due to a lack of funds.

Human Resources, Contract Service Providers, Employees

We operate our business utilizing resources to provide services to the Company on a contractual basis. We feel this is most prudent as we can cost effectively meet our needs and leverage capabilities of talented individuals without employing on a full time basis. As the business grows, we expect to add a number of full-time employees. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future. Except for our stock option plan, there are presently no employee benefits available to our officers and directors.
