ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
General
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2010 under the name “Advanced Ventures Corp.” Effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” Effective March 26, 2018, we changed our name to Noble Vici Group, Inc. and our trading symbol was changed to NVGI. On August 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of Noble Vici Private Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Singapore (“NVPL”), which was wholly owned by Eldee Tang, our sole director and Chief Executive Officer. NVPL is engaged in the IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce business. As a result of our acquisition of NVPL, we entered into the IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce business. We are headquartered in Singapore and operate a branch office in Taiwan. Certain of our resellers are operating “V-More” branded satellite offices in Shenzhen, China.
History
 
As Advanced Ventures Corp., we acquired a patent (U.S. Patent Number: 6,743,209) (the “Patent”), for a catheter with a integral anchoring mechanism. During the second fiscal quarter of 2014, we elected to discontinue our business of exploiting the Patent and began to consider other business opportunities that may bring quicker and greater value to our stockholders. We initially considered entering into the business of trading precious metal bullion primarily in the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, effective January 6, 2014, we changed our name to “Gold Union Inc.” to more adequately reflect our initial intended business operations.
 
Effective March 7, 2012, we increased the number of our authorized shares of common stock to three billion shares (3,000,000,000) and engaged in a forward stock split of our common shares whereby each one share of our common stock was split into fifteen shares of our common stock.
 
On December 31, 2015, we consummated a Share Exchange Agreement with G.U. International Limited, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles and our wholly owned subsidiary (“GUI”), and Kao Wei-Chen, an individual representing herself and 8 other individuals (collectively, the “Golden Corridor Shareholders”), which agreement was amended several times to extend the closing date of the acquisition (collectively, the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we, through GUI, purchased 480 shares of Phnom Penh Golden Corridor Trading Co. Limited (the “GC Shares”), from 9 private Golden Corridor Shareholders, representing 48% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Golden Corridor. As consideration, we issued to the Golden Corridor Shareholders 2,500,000,000 shares of our common stock, at a value of US $0.002 per share, for an aggregate value of US $5,000,000.

As a result of our acquisition of the GC Shares, we ceased our metal bullion trading business and entered into the real estate development and rental business located in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Golden Corridor owns three parcels of land located at National Road 44, Phum Phkung, Chbarmorn Commune, Chbarmorn District, Kampong Speu Province, Kingdom of Cambodia, measuring an aggregate of 172,510 square meters (collectively, the “Properties”). We intended to develop the Properties into an industrial park for rental income.
 
Due to difficulties in entering the real estate development and rental business, on February 2, 2018, we engaged in a corporate reorganization and distributed the GC Shares to our shareholders. On March 18, 2018, our subsidiary, G.U. Asia Limited was dissolved.
 
Change in Control to Current Business
 
On January 29, 2018, Eldee Tang entered into Share Sale Agreements with Kao Wei-Chen and three other shareholders and former affiliates of the Company to purchase up to 1,675,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share purchase price of US$0.00008, for an aggregate price of US$134,000. On June 15, 2018, the Company effectuated a 1 for 1,000 reverse stock split whereby every 1,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were reduced to one share. The parties effectuated Mr. Tang’s purchase of 750,000 shares such securities (expressed on a post reverse split basis) effective June 15, 2018. Mr. Tang expects to purchase the balance of the 925,000 shares from Kao Wei-Chen, a former affiliate of the Company, in the near future. The foregoing description of the Share Sale Agreement with Kao Wei-Chen is qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreement which is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Quarterly Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with the contemplated change in control, on March 27, 2018, Lim Yew Chuan, the director, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Noble Vici Group, Inc. (the “Company”), resigned from all of his positions as director, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Company. Concurrently, Eldee Tang was appointed to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, together with other members of the new management team.
 
Effective June 15, 2018, we:
 

1. | Increased the Company’s authorized capital from 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Common Stock”), to 3,050,000,000 shares, consisting of 3,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Preferred Stock”);
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition of NVPL, TDA and NDA
 
On August 8, 2018, we consummated the acquisition of Noble Vici Private Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of Singapore (“NVPL”), in accordance with the terms of a Share Exchange Agreement. NVPL is wholly owned by Eldee Tang, our Chief Executive Officer and Director. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we purchased One Million and One (1,000,001) shares of NVPL (the “NVPL Shares”), representing all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NVPL, in consideration of One Hundred Forty Million (140,000,000) shares of our common stock, at a value of US $1.70 per share, for an aggregate value of US $238,000,000. It is our understanding that Mr. Tang is not a U.S. Person within the meaning of Regulations S. Accordingly, the Shares are being sold pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated thereunder.

Our Operations and Future Plans
 
We are focused on providing users with innovative tools to live and interact in the modern mobile world through its ecosystem of IoT, Big Data, Blockchain and E-commerce products and services. We integrate blockchain technology with our E-commerce platform to connect consumers and merchants in a dynamic global marketplace via blockchain transactions. We onboard users, consumers and referrers through our Affiliate Incentivized Marketing (AIM) model while merchants are onboarded via our Merchant Incentivized Marketing (MIM) model. Some products and services offered in our ecosystem include procurement of discounted goods and services, referral reward system, mobile games and digital marketing, financial markets apps and a “Business Centre” within the same app. Our E-commerce platform not only offers users the ability to make online purchases, but also the convenience of an O2O (Online to Offline) platform whereby consumers can transact at a discount online while goods and services are distributed at a physical location. This drives traffic to the already weakened retail industry. The Business Centre within our ecosystem is offered through a mobile app and allows users to create their own referral platform within our ecosystem.
 
We are pursuing a plan of expansion and hope to achieve revenue growth through mass adoption by users and merchants of our platform/ecosystem. We seek to increase our user and merchant base through user incentive programs and brand awareness marketing programs, among other things. We expect to focus on users and merchants located in China and the Asia Pacific region in the foreseeable future. Similarly, we intend to seek corporate growth by listing our securities on a national exchange such as the Nasdaq Capital Markets in the future. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to successfully grow our revenues or list our securities on a national exchange in the future, if ever.
 
Near-Term Requirements For Additional Capital
 
For the immediate future, we intend to finance our business efforts and any future acquisitions through sales of our securities to existing shareholders and loans from existing shareholders or financial institutions. We have not yet generated revenues. We expect to incur relatively small operating losses over the next twelve months until we acquire an operating company. There can be no assurance that that we will be successful in consummating a business acquisition or that such business will be successful after acquisition.
Intellectual Property
 
We continue to own the rights, title and interests in Patent for a receptacle catheter with integral anchoring means, which Patent is associated with our former business. The Patent was issued on September 1, 2004 and will expire on September 6, 2022. We do not expect to exploit this Patent in the near future.
Employees
 
As of July 12, 2019, we have the following employees:
 

Executive Officer | 2 
------------------------+---
Service Representative | 4 
Tech Development Staff | 3 
Sales & Marketing Staff | 5 
Administration Staff | 4

We are required to make contributions under a defined contribution pension plan for all of our eligible employees in Singapore. We are required to contribute a specified percentage of the participants’ relevant income based on their ages and wages level.
