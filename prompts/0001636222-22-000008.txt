Item 1. | Business

Throughout this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ: WING) and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as the "Company," "Wingstop," or in the first-person notations of "we," "us," and "our."
General
Wingstop is the largest fast casual chicken wings-focused restaurant chain in the world, with over 1,700 locations worldwide. The first Wingstop opened in Garland, Texas in 1994, and we began franchising Wingstop restaurants in 1997. Since 2015, Wingstop Inc.'s common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “WING.” We are dedicated to serving the world flavor through an unparalleled guest experience and offering of classic wings, boneless wings and tenders, always cooked to order, and hand-sauced-and-tossed in 11 bold, distinctive flavors.
The Company is primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Wingstop’s restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. We operate in a single segment for reporting purposes and generate revenues by charging royalties, advertising fees, and franchise fees to our franchisees and by operating a number of our own restaurants. We believe our asset-light, highly-franchised business model generates strong operating margins and requires low capital expenditures, creating stockholder value through strong and consistent free cash flow and capital-efficient growth.
Our Brand
It is our mission to serve the world flavor. We offer our guests fresh, cooked-to-order wings with bold, layered flavors that touch all of the senses, and we complement our wings with fresh-cut, seasoned fries and fresh, hand-cut carrots and celery. We round out the flavor experience with ranch and bleu cheese dips that are made in-house daily. We never use heat lamps or microwaves in the preparation of our food.
Our 11 flavor offerings create a differentiated experience that drives demand across multiple day parts and occasions. Paired with our numerous order options (eat-in (to the extent available) / to go / delivery; individual / combo meals / family packs) that allow guests to eat Wingstop during any occasion, whether it is a quick carry-out snack, a party size order for their favorite group occasion, or delivery for a family dinner, we believe this customizable unique experience drives repeat business and brand loyalty.
Our Vision
Our vision is to become a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand. Based on our internal analysis, we believe there is opportunity for our brand to grow to more than 4,000 restaurants across the United States and to more than 3,000 restaurants internationally. Our approach to becoming a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand centers around the following key strategic priorities:
–sustaining long-term same store sales growth;
–maintaining best in class returns; and
–expanding our global footprint.
This approach is built upon the foundation of our investments in the people and infrastructure necessary to build our organization for the next level.
Sustaining Long-Term Same Store Sales Growth through Brand Awareness and Innovation
We believe in sustaining long-term same store sales growth through brand awareness. Our national advertising program is funded through the Wingstop Restaurants Advertising Fund (the “Ad Fund”), a consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund for which a percentage of gross sales is collected from Wingstop restaurant domestic franchisees and company-owned restaurants to be used for various forms of advertising for the Wingstop brand. Domestic franchisees are required to contribute 4% of gross sales to the Ad Fund. The continued growth of our national advertising program since its inception in 2017 supports elevated marketing spend and premium placements through an extensive range of social media and digital marketing channels, including search engine, digital video, and social media advertising, to allow us to target core customers and create top of mind consideration with relevant, impactful messaging.
We are making focused investments in customer relationship management (“CRM”) and our digital platform, which will allow us to transition from the traditional promotion-based marketing approach to a digital platform-based strategy. As a result of these investments, we continue to sustain digital sales above 60%.
Maintaining Best-in-Class Unit Economics
We believe the growing popularity of the Wingstop experience and the operational simplicity of our restaurants translate into attractive economics at our franchised- and company-owned locations. Existing franchisees accounted for approximately 93% of franchised restaurants opened in 2021 and approximately 94% of franchised restaurants opened in 2020, which we believe further underscores our restaurant model’s financial appeal. 
Upon opening, our restaurant volume generally builds year after year. Our domestic average unit volume (“AUV”) has grown consistently, approximating $1.6 million during fiscal year 2021. Our operating model targets a low average estimated initial investment of approximately $400,000, excluding real estate purchase or lease costs and pre-opening expenses. In year two of operation, we target a franchisee unlevered cash-on-cash return of approximately 50%+. We believe low entry costs and high returns provide a compelling investment opportunity for our franchisees that has helped drive the continued growth of our system. 
Expanding Our Global Footprint
We believe in the importance of building one global brand with a distinctive flavor experience that is consistent around the globe. This includes laying the groundwork for a global supply chain to support expansion of our global footprint, as well as creating a consistent digital presence centered around our global technology strategy which includes expanding our best-in-class domestic digital platform internationally.
We believe that there is significant opportunity to expand globally, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic penetration in both existing and new domestic markets, as well as international markets. We believe our highly-franchised model positions us for continued strong unit growth over the medium- and long-term. We expect franchisee demand for our brand, supported by compelling unit economics, operational simplicity, low entry costs, and flexible real estate profile, to drive global restaurant growth. 
We believe we can achieve our domestic restaurant potential by expanding in our existing markets where we believe we can double our current restaurant count, as well as continuing to expand into emerging markets. Our domestic market expansion strategy focuses on maximizing our brand market share and visibility in key priority markets. We have a robust development pipeline with approximately 90% of our domestic commitments as of December 25, 2021 from existing franchisees, supporting the strength of our restaurant business model and our positive franchisor-franchisee relationships. 
We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to grow our business internationally. As of December 25, 2021, we had 197 international restaurants located in six countries, all of which were franchised. In fiscal year 2021, we opened 34 international locations. We believe that our restaurant operating model translates well internationally based on our small real estate footprint, our simplicity of operations, the universal and broad appeal of chicken, and our ability to customize our wide variety of flavors to local tastes.
Our Franchise
Franchise Overview
Our franchisees operated a total of 1,695 restaurants in 44 states and seven countries as of December 25, 2021. We have rigorous qualification criteria and training programs for our franchisees and require them to adhere to strict operating standards. We work hard to ensure that every Wingstop franchise location meets the same quality and customer service benchmarks in order to preserve the consistency and reliability of the Wingstop brand.
Franchisees (along with their managers) must attend and successfully complete a four-week training program prior to opening a new franchise restaurant. Our training program covers various topics including Wingstop culture, food preparation and storage, food safety, cleaning and sanitation, marketing and advertising, point of sale (“POS”) systems, accounting, and hospitality, among others. 
All of our franchise agreements require that each franchised restaurant be operated in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu we establish, and meet applicable quality, service, health, and cleanliness standards. We may terminate the franchise rights of any franchisee who does not comply with our standards and requirements. We believe that maintaining superior food quality, an inviting and energetic atmosphere, and excellent guest service are critical to the reputation and success of our concept. Therefore, we enforce the contractual requirements of our franchise agreements.
We have a broad and diversified domestic franchisee base. Since 2014, the number of franchisees who own ten or more restaurants has more than doubled. This increase is consistent with our strategy to grow with our existing franchisees. As of December 25, 2021, our domestic franchise base had an average restaurant ownership of approximately six restaurants per franchisee and an average tenure of twelve years. 
U.S. Franchise Agreements
We enter into franchise agreements with U.S. franchisees under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a restaurant in a particular location, typically providing for a 10-year initial term, with an opportunity to enter into one or more renewal franchise agreements subject to certain conditions. We generally update and/or revise our franchise agreement on an annual basis and, as a result, the agreements we enter into with individual franchisees may vary. Our franchise documents currently provide that franchisees must pay a franchise fee of $20,000 for each restaurant opened. If a franchisee has entered into an area development agreement to develop restaurants in a defined market area with us (which occurs, in most cases, even if a franchisee wants to develop only one restaurant), the aggregate initial fee is $30,000 for each restaurant, which includes a $10,000 development fee per restaurant. The $10,000 development fee per restaurant to-be-developed is paid in full at the time a development agreement is signed for the grant of development rights and is not refundable.
Under our current standard franchise agreement, each franchisee is required to pay us a royalty of 6% of their gross sales net of discounts. Each restaurant also contributes 4% of gross sales net of discounts to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the contribution rate will increase to 5% of gross sales net of discounts. These funds are managed by the Ad Fund and are primarily used to create advertising content and purchase digital and television advertising on a national level. 
International Franchise Agreements
Our markets outside of the United States are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries. The master franchise agreement typically requires the franchisees to open a minimum number of restaurants within a specified period. The master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial, upfront development fee for the territory as well as a franchise fee for each restaurant opened. Under our current standard master franchise agreement, each master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales, which varies among international markets, but is currently set at 6%. 
Suppliers and Distribution 
Our franchisees are required to purchase all chicken, groceries, produce, beverages, equipment and signage, furniture, fixtures, logo-imprinted paper goods, and cleaning supplies solely from suppliers that we designate and approve. Our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety. We regularly inspect vendors to ensure our standards are being met and that prices offered are competitive. 
The principal raw materials for a Wingstop restaurant operation are bone-in and boneless chicken wings. Therefore, chicken is our largest product cost item and represented approximately 69% of all purchases for the 2021 fiscal year. Company-owned and franchised restaurants purchase their bone-in and boneless chicken wings from suppliers that we designate and approve. We designate sources for potatoes to ensure that they are grown to our specifications. We also require franchisees to use our proprietary sauces, seasonings, and spice blends and to purchase them and other proprietary products only from designated sources. 
All food items and packaging goods for Wingstop restaurants are sourced through one distributor, Performance Food Group (“PFG”). There are 16 geographically diverse PFG distribution centers, which carry all products required for a Wingstop restaurant and service all of Wingstop’s domestic restaurants. PFG is contractually obligated to deliver products to our restaurants at least twice weekly. PFG provides consolidated deliveries with a tightly controlled and monitored cold chain. Its national distribution system has a documented recovery plan to handle any disruption. Wingstop contracts directly with manufacturers to sell products to PFG, who in turn receives a fee for delivering these items to our restaurants. The majority of Wingstop’s highest-spend items are formula or fixed-contract priced. Wingstop has also negotiated agreements with its soft drink suppliers to offer soft drink dispensing systems, along with associated branded products, in all Wingstop restaurants.
Information / Technology Systems
We have core information systems in place that, together with focused investments we are making in technology, we believe are designed to scale and support our future growth plans. We specify a POS system and restaurant management system in all domestic restaurants that helps facilitate the operation of the restaurants by recording sales, purchasing and inventory of goods, managing of labor and assessing restaurant performance. Our POS system and restaurant management system is configured to record and store financial information in a manner that we specify, and we require franchisees to provide us with continual and unlimited independent access to all information on each POS system.
We have an online ordering platform and mobile ordering applications that integrate with third party delivery providers and our POS system, which makes it easy for our guests to order-ahead, and which we believe leads to higher check averages.
We require our franchisees’ electronic information systems, including POS systems, comply with and maintain established network security standards, including applicable Payment Card Industry and data privacy standards.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 25, 2021, we employed 890 employees, affectionately referred to as team members, of whom 240 were full-time corporate-based and regional personnel. The remainder were part-time or restaurant-level team members. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that we have good relations with our team members. Our franchise owners are independent business owners, so they and their team members are not included in our team member count and are not our team members. 
Our human capital objectives include attracting, training, motivating, rewarding and retaining team members. To support these objectives, our team member programs are designed to develop talent and prepare team members for advancement and leadership positions in the future; provide market-competitive pay and benefits; focus on team members’ health, safety and well-being; enhance our culture through our continuing efforts to make our workplace more engaging and inclusive; and acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. 
We are committed to fostering an environment of diversity and inclusion, including among our board of directors, and having diverse representation across all levels of our workforce. Examples of some of our recent efforts and metrics include:
•we implemented unconscious bias training for all our corporate team members;
•currently 60% of our franchisees and 50% of our board of directors classify as diverse;
•we are a member of the Women’s Foodservice Forum; 
•we launched a partnership with Disability Solutions to help reach talented and qualified people with disabilities to serve on our Wingstop team; and
•our Chief Executive Officer joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion.
We are also committed to providing competitive pay to compensate and reward our team members. All corporate management and staff and restaurant management positions, including hourly assistant managers and shift leaders, are eligible for performance-based cash incentives. Our incentive plan reinforces and rewards individuals for achievement of specific company and/or restaurant business goals.
We offer comprehensive benefit programs to eligible team members. Our core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued a strong focus on team member well-being, health and safety.
Another area of focus for us is investing in people and infrastructure to build the organization for the next level. In addition to seeking to acquire new talent in the marketplace that share our values and goals, we recognize and support the growth and development of our team members and offer opportunities to participate in regular talent and development planning reviews to assist us with growing our internal restaurant teams, resulting in a majority of current managers of company-owned restaurants being promoted from within.
Government Regulation
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal regulations affecting the operation of our business. We and our franchisees are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and various other federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A 
significant number of our and our franchisees’ food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our and our franchisees’ labor costs, as would future increases. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us and our franchisees.
We are subject to extensive and varied state and local government regulation affecting the operation of our business, as are our franchisees, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation, fire prevention, and franchise operation. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, including with respect to zoning, health, safety, sanitation, nutritional information disclosure, environmental, and building and fire safety, in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Our and our franchisees’ licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees, or our franchisees or their employees, of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control, such as those regulating the minimum age of patrons or employees, advertising, wholesale purchasing, and inventory control.
In addition, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state franchise laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees in advance of any franchise sale or the receipt of any consideration for the franchise, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document at least annually with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration (though not disclosure) in several states based on our qualifications for exemption as set forth in each such state’s laws. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including in the areas of termination and non-renewal, presently exist in a substantial number of states. We believe that our franchise disclosure document and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.
Our international franchised restaurants are subject to national and local laws and regulations that are often similar to those affecting our U.S. restaurants. We believe that we have established procedures at our international franchised restaurants that provide reasonable assurance that our international franchised restaurants comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable foreign jurisdiction.
Trademarks
We have many registered trademarks and believe that the Wingstop mark and Wingstop names and logos, in particular, have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our trademarks and to vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our trademarks. We license the use of our registered marks to franchisees through franchise agreements.
Environmental Matters
We are not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that we would expect to materially affect our earnings or competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. During the 2021 fiscal year, there were no material environmental compliance-related capital expenditures.
Community Involvement
In 2016, we created Wingstop Charities, a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing and elevating the community work of our franchisees to make a difference in the lives of our youth. We are committed to strengthening the communities we serve by being strong, active, corporate citizens and good neighbors. In fiscal year 2021, more than 120 organizations and team members received grants or team member assistance. In fiscal year 2020, we donated $1 million to the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation’s Restaurant Employee Relief Fund and, in partnership with our franchisees, donated more than one million meals to frontline workers and COVID-19 first responders. Since its inception, Wingstop Charities has donated over $1 million through local grants and team member assistance. To learn more about how Wingstop Charities is making an impact in our local communities, visit www.wingstopcharities.org.
