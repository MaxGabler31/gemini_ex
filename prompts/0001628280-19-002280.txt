Item 1. | Business

Overview
William Lyon Homes, a Delaware corporation, together with its subsidiaries, is one of the largest Western U.S. regional homebuilders. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, the Company is primarily engaged in the design, construction, marketing and sale of single-family detached and attached homes in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Texas. The Company's core markets currently include Orange County, Los Angeles, the Inland Empire, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Denver, Seattle, Portland, Austin and San Antonio. The Company has a distinguished legacy of more than 62 years of homebuilding operations, over which time it has sold in excess of 106,000 homes. The Company believes that its markets are characterized by attractive long-term housing fundamentals and that it has a significant land supply, with 29,541 lots owned or controlled.
The Company has significant expertise in understanding the needs of its homebuyers and designing its product offerings to meet those needs. This allows the Company to maximize the return on its land investments by tailoring its home offerings to meet the buyer demands in each of its markets. The Company builds and sells across a diverse range of product lines at a variety of price points with sales to entry-level, first-time move-up, second-time move-up homebuyers, as well as a signature luxury brand and an active adult target segment. The Company is committed to achieving the highest standards in design, quality and customer satisfaction and has received numerous industry awards and commendations throughout its operating history in recognition of its achievements. 
In 2018, the Company delivered 4,186 homes, with an average selling price ("ASP") of approximately $497,300, and recognized home sales revenues of $2.1 billion. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a consolidated backlog of 1,041 sold but unclosed homes, with an associated sales value of $479.0 million, representing a 11% increase in value as compared to its backlog as of December 31, 2017. The average selling price of homes in backlog as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $460,100.
The Company’s Markets
The Company is currently operating in seven reportable operating segments: California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Texas. Each of the segments has responsibility for the management of the Company’s homebuilding and development operations within its geographic footprint. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further information.
The following table sets forth homebuilding revenue from each of the Company’s homebuilding segments for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands):

Strategy and Lot Position
The Company owned approximately 17,649 lots and had options to purchase an additional 11,892 lots as of December 31, 2018. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “entitled” land typically has a development agreement and/or vesting tentative map, or a final recorded plat or map from the appropriate county or city government. Development agreements and vesting tentative maps generally provide for the right to develop the land in accordance with the provisions of the development agreement or vesting tentative map unless an issue arises concerning health, safety or general welfare. The Company’s sources of developed lots for its homebuilding operations are (1) purchase of smaller projects with shorter life cycles (merchant homebuilding) and (2) development of larger scale projects to perform land development activities for the purpose of (i) merchant homebuilding or (ii) selling lots to other builders, and/or master-planned communities.
The Company intends to continue to utilize its current inventory of lots and future land acquisitions to conduct its operating strategy, which consists of:

1. | converting our lot supply into active projects;


2. | maximizing revenue at communities;


3. | maintaining a low cost structure;


4. | acquiring land positions through disciplined acquisition strategies near employment centers or transportation corridors;


5. | leveraging an experienced management team;


6. | deleveraging the balance sheet; and


7. | generating positive cash flows and strong returns for shareholders.

Land Acquisition and Development
To manage the risks associated with land ownership and development, the Company has a Corporate Land Committee, which is comprised of certain members of its senior executive management team whom are key operational and financial executives. As potential land acquisitions are being analyzed, the Corporate Land Committee must approve all land acquisitions. Further, the Company's board of directors must also approve land purchases over certain dollar thresholds. The Company’s long-term strategy consists of the following elements:

• | completing due diligence prior to contracting to acquire land;


• | reviewing the status of entitlements and other governmental processing to mitigate or eliminate zoning and other entitlement or development risk;


• | maximizing density to achieve more units per acre;


• | analyzing project pricing compared to the market's median home price;


• | focusing on land as a component of a home’s cost structure, rather than on the land’s speculative value;


• | limiting land acquisition size to reduce investment levels in any one project where possible;

5


• | utilizing option, joint venture and other non-capital intensive structures to control land and reduce risk where feasible;


• | funding land acquisitions whenever possible with non-recourse seller financing;


• | employing centralized control of approval over all land transactions; and


• | diversifying with respect to market segments and product types.

Prior to committing to the acquisition of land, the Company conducts feasibility studies covering pertinent aspects of the proposed commitment. These studies may include a variety of elements from technical aspects such as title, zoning, soil and seismic characteristics, to marketing studies that review population and employment trends, schools, transportation access, buyer profiles, sales forecasts, projected profitability, cash requirements, and assessment of geo-political risk and other factors. Prior to acquiring land, the Company considers assumptions concerning the needs of the targeted customer and determines whether the underlying land price enables the Company to meet those needs at an affordable price. Before purchasing land, the Company attempts to project the commencement of construction and sales over a reasonable time period. The Company utilizes architects and outside consultants, under close supervision, to help review acquisitions and design products.
Homebuilding and Market Strategy
The Company currently has a wide variety of product lines which enables it to meet the specific needs of each of its markets. The Company creates product for the entry-level, first time move-up, second time move-up, luxury home and active adult markets, and believes that a diversified product strategy enables it to best serve a wide range of buyers and adapt quickly to a variety of market conditions. The Company’s markets are geographically diverse in order to mitigate market risk.
Because the decision as to which product to develop is based on the Company’s assessment of market conditions and the restrictions imposed by government regulations, home styles and sizes vary from project to project. The Company generally standardizes and limits the number of home designs within any given product line. This standardization allows on-site mass production techniques and bulk purchasing of materials and components, thus enabling the Company to better control and sometimes reduce construction costs and home construction cycles.
The Company contracts with a number of architects and other consultants who are involved in the design process of the Company’s homes. Designs are constrained by zoning requirements, building codes, energy efficiency laws and local architectural guidelines, among other factors. Engineering, landscaping, master-planning and environmental impact analysis work are subcontracted to independent firms which are familiar with local requirements.
Substantially all construction work is done by subcontractors with the Company acting as the general contractor. The Company manages subcontractor activities with on-site supervisory employees and management control systems. The Company does not have long-term contractual commitments with its subcontractors or suppliers, and instead it contracts development work by project and where possible by phase size of 10 to 25 home sites or by building/structure for attached product. The Company generally has been able to obtain sufficient materials and subcontractors during times of material shortages, though it has experienced skilled labor shortages in certain markets during times of peak demand. The Company believes its relationships with its suppliers and subcontractors are in good standing.
Description of Projects and Communities Under Development
The Company’s homebuilding projects usually take two to five years to develop. The following table presents project information relating to each of the Company’s homebuilding operating segments as of December 31, 2018, which includes lots owned as of December 31, 2018, lots consolidated in accordance with certain accounting principles as of December 31, 2018, homes either closed or in backlog as of or for the period ended December 31, 2018, and lots controlled as of December 31, 2018. The following table includes certain information that is forward-looking or predictive in nature and is based on expectations and projections about future events. Such information is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecast in the table below. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update or revise the information in the table below to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or changes to projections over time. See "CAUTIONARY NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1) | The estimated number of homes to be built at completion is approximate and includes home sites in our backlog. Such estimated amounts are subject to change based on, among other things, future site planning, as well as zoning and permit changes, and there can be no assurance that the Company will build these homes. Further, certain projects may include lots that the Company controls, and that are also reflected in "Lots Owned or Controlled as of December 31, 2018".


(2) | “Cumulative Homes Closed” represents homes closed since the project opened, and may include prior years, in addition to the homes closed during the current year presented.


(3) | Backlog consists of homes sold under sales contracts that have not yet closed, and there can be no assurance that closings of sold homes will occur.


(4) | Of the total homes subject to pending sales contracts as of December 31, 2018, 628 represent homes that are completed or under construction.


(5) | Lots owned or controlled as of December 31, 2018 include lots in backlog at December 31, 2018 and projects with lots owned as of December 31, 2018 that are expected to open for sale and have an estimated year of first delivery of 2019 or later, as well as lots controlled as of December 31, 2018, and parcels of undeveloped land held for future sale. Certain lots controlled are under land banking arrangements which may become owned and produce deliveries during 2019. Actual homes at completion may change prior to the marketing and sales of homes in these projects and the sales price ranges for these projects are to be determined and will be based on current market conditions and other factors upon the commencement of active selling. There can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any of the controlled lots reflected in these amounts.


(6) | Estimated sales price range reflects the most recent pricing updates of the base price only and excludes any lot premium, buyer incentive and buyer selected options, which vary from project to project. Sales prices reflect current pricing estimates and might not be indicative of past or future pricing. Further, any potential benefit to be gained from an increase in sales price ranges as compared to previously estimated amounts may be offset by increases in costs, profit participation, and other factors.

Sales and Marketing
Each segment's management team develops a sales and marketing strategy for each project, which includes:
•market studies of existing home sales, both re-sale and new homes, as well as competition market analysis to establish pricing;
•developing the advertising program based on the product segmentation; and
•understanding the buyer profile to target marketing efforts.
The Company makes use of marketing tactics that include promotional events as well as on-line and off-line advertising channels. Advertising channels include primarily off-site signage programs that serve as way-finding to individual neighborhood model complexes, online digital advertising specifically targeting potential homebuyers and on-site promotional events to support new neighborhood grand openings, new phase releases and/or homeowner referrals.
7

The Company normally builds, decorates, furnishes and landscapes three to seven model homes for each product line and maintains on-site sales offices, which typically are open seven days a week, however, in some cases the Company will operate out of an on-site sales trailer prior to model home construction. Management believes that model homes and sales trailers play a particularly important role in the Company’s marketing efforts. Consequently, the Company expends a significant amount of effort in creating an attractive atmosphere at its model homes. Interior decorations vary among the Company’s models and are carefully selected based upon the lifestyles of targeted buyers. Structural changes in design from the model homes are not generally permitted, but home buyers may select various other optional construction and design amenities.
The Company employs in-house commissioned sales personnel to sell its homes, and outside brokers are also involved in the selling of the Company’s homes. The Company typically engages its sales personnel on a long-term, rather than a project-by-project basis, which it believes results in a more motivated sales force with an extensive knowledge of the Company’s operating policies and products. Sales personnel are trained by the Company and attend regular meetings to be updated on the availability of financing, construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans.
The Company strives to provide a high level of customer help service throughout the entire sales process and after a home has closed escrow. The participation of the sales representatives, on-site construction supervisors and the post-closing customer service personnel, working in a team effort, is intended to foster the Company’s reputation for quality and service, and ultimately lead to an overall better customer home-buying experience that will benefit not only the customer directly, but also benefit the company in improving buyer retention and future homeowner referrals.
The Company’s homes are typically sold before or during construction through sales contracts which are usually accompanied by a small cash deposit. Such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer’s ability to qualify for financing. The cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow at the Company and its joint ventures’ projects was approximately 16% during 2018 and 15% during 2017. Cancellations are caused by a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control such as buyer’s change in ability to secure financing over time, individual life changing events, or overall economic market conditions. 
Warranty
The Company provides its homebuyers with a one to three year limited warranty, depending upon the timing of close of escrow and location of the project, covering workmanship and materials. The Company also provides its homebuyers with a limited warranty that covers “construction defects,” as defined in the limited warranty agreement provided to each home buyer, for the length of its legal liability for such defects (which may be up to ten years in some circumstances), as determined by the law of the state in which the Company builds. The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with the Company and requires that homebuyers agree to the definitions and procedures set forth in the warranty, including the submission of unresolved construction-related disputes to binding arbitration. In connection with the limited warranty covering construction defects, the Company maintains general liability insurance coverage. The Company believes that its insurance policies will respond to construction defect claims on homes that close during each policy period for the duration of the Company’s legal liability, upon satisfaction of the applicable self-insured retention. In all of our geographic markets with the exception of Texas, where we maintain and require our subcontractors to maintain a separate general liability policy, each of our insurance policies provides a single wrap-up policy of insurance to the Company and its subcontractors. As a result, the Company is not required to obtain proof of insurance from its subcontractors nor be named as an additional insured under their individual insurance policies regarding the subcontractors' general liability policies for work on the Company's projects. The subcontractors still must provide proof of insurance regarding general liability coverage for off-site work, worker's compensation and auto coverage. Furthermore, the Company generally requires that each subcontractor and design professional agreement provide the Company with an indemnity, subject to various limitations. 
There can be no assurance, however, that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be enforceable against the homebuyers, that the Company will be able to renew its insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that the Company will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building-related claims or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with the Company’s subcontractors and design professionals or that such subcontractors and design professionals will be viable entities at the time of the claim.
Raw Materials
Typically, all of the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started or other market conditions could cause delays in the delivery of, shortages in, or higher prices for necessary materials. Delivery delays or the inability to obtain necessary materials could result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We have 
8

established national purchase programs for certain materials and we continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available.
Sale of Lots and Land
In the ordinary course of business, the Company continually evaluates land sales and has sold, and expects that it will continue to sell, land as market and business conditions warrant. The Company may also sell both multiple lots to other builders (bulk sales) and improved individual lots for the construction of custom homes where the presence of such homes adds to the quality of the community. In addition, the Company may acquire sites with commercial, industrial and multi-family parcels which will generally be sold to third-party developers.
Customer Financing
The Company seeks to assist its home buyers in obtaining mortgage financing for qualified buyers. Substantially all home buyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers. In connection with the Polygon Acquisition in 2014, the Company acquired a membership interest in an unconsolidated joint venture which provides certain mortgage brokerage services, in part, to its customers in Washington and Oregon. In addition, in 2015 the Company announced the formation of a separate unconsolidated joint venture, of which it holds a membership interest, which provides a variety of mortgage banking services, in part, to its customers in California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. While the Company's affiliated mortgage ventures may offer or provide certain mortgage services to the Company's homebuyers, the Company's homebuyers may obtain mortgage financing to purchase its homes from any lender or other provider of their choice.
Information Systems and Controls
The Company assigns a high priority to the development and maintenance of its budget and cost control systems and procedures. The Company’s segment offices are connected to corporate headquarters through a fully integrated accounting, financial and operational management information system. Through this system, management regularly evaluates the status of its projects in relation to budgets to determine the cause of any variances and, where appropriate, adjusts the Company’s operations to capitalize on favorable variances or to limit adverse financial impacts.
Regulation
The Company and its competitors are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulation which imposes restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can ultimately be built within the boundaries of a particular project. The Company and its competitors may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states in which it operates. Because the Company usually purchases land with entitlements, the Company believes that the moratoriums would adversely affect the Company only if they arose from unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. However, these are normally locked-in when the Company receives entitlements.
The Company and its competitors are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site’s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause the Company and its competitors to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Environmental laws and regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. The Company’s projects in California are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. However, environmental laws have not, to date, had a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, California Lyon, is licensed as a general building contractor in California, Arizona and Nevada, in various municipalities within Colorado as required, and in Oregon. California Lyon holds a corporate real estate license under the California Real Estate Law. In addition, certain subsidiaries of the Company hold general contractor licenses and/or real estate broker licenses as necessary under the relevant jurisdictions.
Competition
The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. The Company competes for homebuyers 
9

primarily on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including home design and location, construction quality, customer service and satisfaction, and reputation. The Company believes that it competes effectively in its existing markets as a result of its product and geographic diversity, substantial development expertise and its reputation as a low-cost producer of quality homes. Further, the Company believes that it sometimes gains a competitive advantage in locations where changing regulations make it difficult for competitors to obtain entitlements and/or government approvals which the Company has already obtained. 
Seasonality
The Company’s operations are historically seasonal, with the highest new order activity typically occurring in the spring and summer, which is impacted by the timing of project openings and competition in surrounding projects, among other factors. In addition, a majority of the Company’s home deliveries typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of each fiscal year, based on the construction cycle times of our homes between five and eight months. As a result, the Company’s revenues, cash flow and profitability are higher in that same period.
Financing
The Company provides for its ongoing cash requirements principally from internally generated funds from the sales of real estate, outside borrowings and by forming new joint ventures with venture partners that provide a substantial portion of the capital required for certain projects. In addition, the Company makes use of the funds received from certain recent corporate transactions including the Company's initial public offering of equity securities, senior notes offerings and other capital markets transactions.
As of December 31, 2018, California Lyon has outstanding its 7% Senior Notes due 2022, 6% Senior Notes due 2023, 5.875% Senior Notes due 2025, certain construction notes payable, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and a letter of credit from its revolving credit facility. In addition to these borrowings, the Company had availability of $311.4 million under its revolving credit facility. Parent, California Lyon and their subsidiaries and joint ventures have financed, and may in the future finance, certain project and land acquisitions with construction loans secured by real estate inventories, seller-provided financing, lot option agreements and land banking transactions.
Corporate Organization and Personnel
The Company combines decentralized management in those aspects of its business where detailed knowledge of local market conditions is important (such as governmental processing, construction, land development and sales and marketing), with centralized management in those functions where the Company believes central control is required (such as approval of land acquisitions, finance, treasury, human resources and legal matters - corporate governance).
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed 870 full-time employees, including corporate staff, supervisory personnel of construction projects, warranty service personnel for completed projects, as well as persons engaged in administrative, finance and accounting, engineering, sales and marketing activities.
The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good. Some employees of the subcontractors the Company utilizes are unionized, but none of the Company’s employees are union members.
