Introduction
 
SCI Engineered Materials, Inc. (“SCI”, “we” or the “Company”), formerly Superconductive Components, Inc., an Ohio corporation, was incorporated in 1987.  We operate in one segment as a global supplier and manufacturer of advanced materials for Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”) Thin Film Applications. We are focused on markets within the PVD industry including Photonics, Thin Film Solar, Glass, Thin Film Battery and Transparent Electronics.  Substantially all of our revenues are generated from customers with multi-national operations.  We have made a considerable resource investment in the Thin Film Solar industry and a number of customers have adopted our products.  Thin Film Battery is a developing market where manufacturers of batteries use our products to produce power supplies. Through collaboration with end users and Original Equipment Manufacturers the Company develops innovative customized solutions enabling commercial success.
 
History of the Company
 
The late Dr. Edward Funk, Sc.D., and his late wife Ingeborg founded SCI in 1987. Dr. Funk, formerly a Professor of Metallurgy at The Ohio State University and a successful entrepreneur, envisioned significant market potential for the then newly discovered High Temperature Superconductivity (“HTS”) material YBCO (Tc of 90o K). Our first product was a 99.999% pure, co-precipitated YBCO 1-2-3 powder. Over the years we expanded our product line by adding other High Tc Powders, sintered shapes, single crystal substrates, and non-superconducting sputtering targets. At this time we are not pursuing this market but these early years of development is the foundation on which our material science experience is built.
 
We opened a subdivision, Target Materials Inc. (“TMI”), in 1991 to supply the increasing worldwide demand for sputtering and laser ablation targets. We became a full service manufacturer of high performance thin film materials, providing a wide selection of metals, ceramics, and alloys for sputtering targets, evaporation sources, and other PVD applications. We served the Research & Development market as well as the Industrial and Decorative Coating markets. During this time, we began to manufacture targets for the Photovoltaic, Flat Panel Display, and Semiconductor industries.
 
SCI and TMI were merged in 2002. We continued to manufacture complex ceramic, metal, and alloy products for the photonic, photovoltaic, thin film battery, media storage, flat panel display, and semiconductor industries.
 
In January 2017, we received ISO 9001:2015 registration, an internationally recognized quality standard. We received ISO 9001:2008 registration in April 2010 and prior to April 2010 we were ISO 9001:2000 registered.
 
Throughout much of our history, we have conducted funded research primarily under grants from entities such as the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Ohio Development Services Agency (formerly known as the Ohio Department of Development). These activities are generally limited to funded research that is consistent with our focus on near term commercial applications in our principal markets.
 
For three decades we have been developing considerable expertise in the development and manufacturing ramp-up of innovative materials, such as Transparent Conductive Oxides for Thin Film Solar applications and targets for thin film batteries. Today, we serve a diverse base of domestic and multi-national corporations, universities, and leading research institutions. We actively seek to partner with organizations to provide solutions for difficult material challenges.
 
Business
 
We are a supplier of materials to the PVD industry. Our customers need our materials to produce nano layers of metals and oxides for advanced material systems. Applications for PVD coatings range from everyday items to complex computer processors. Every day applications include transparent anti-scratch coatings on eyeglasses, coatings on kitchen faucets, as well as low emissivity glass for household windows. More technically advanced applications for our products include semiconductors, thin film solar, flat panel displays, photonics and an emerging technology - Thin Film Battery.

We continue to pursue niche opportunities where our core competencies give us an advantage and that fit our manufacturing capabilities. This disciplined approach enables us to focus on those opportunities that are the best fit for our capabilities and also offer the greatest long-term return. Considerations include our core strengths, resource requirements, and time-to-market.
 
Photonics currently represents the largest market for our materials. Our customers are continually identifying new materials that improve the utility of optical coatings. This includes improvements in their ability to focus, filter or reflect light, all of which increase the potential demand for the types and amounts of products we sell in this market. Photonic applications continue to expand as new methods are found to manipulate light waves to enhance the various applications for light.
 
We have developed products for the Thin Film Solar (“TFS”) market. We are well positioned in the TFS area having supplied materials to that market for over twenty years from the early stages of TFS development. We continue to increase our visibility in the global arena by attending various trade shows targeted at the solar market. We have added representatives for Korea, China, and Taiwan. Market expansion is expected to continue in 2018 and we are poised to benefit, with minimal capital additions, as TFS grows. We see increased opportunities in both domestic and foreign markets.
 
We continued to develop TCO systems for the solar and glass markets and added domestic and international customers for these products. Despite short term uncertainties, the solar industry is projected to have strong growth for the next few decades. The TFS market, which we serve, is expected to gain market share in roof applications with low weight flexible products, vehicles and mobile devices during that period. Given current market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development, marketing, and sales.
 
Thin Film Battery is a developing market where manufacturers of batteries use our lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) targets as a key element to produce power supplies with small quantities of stored energy. A typical Thin Film Battery would be produced via PVD with five or more thin layers. Following several years of industry developments, some Thin Film Battery customers announced their batteries are commercially available. Our customers anticipate the unique properties of these batteries could be used in applications in wearable electronic devices, integrated circuits, RFID, smart cards, hand held and flexible electronics and many other applications.
 
We continue to invest in developing new products for all current markets which includes accelerating time to market.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had total revenue of $6,801,365. This was an increase of $1,335,766, or 24.4% compared to 2016. The increase was due to increased sales of solar products, pricing and product mix. 
 
Our largest customer represented approximately 72% of total revenues in 2017 and 53% in 2016.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
Europe and Asia, as well as the Americas, have high demand for sputtering targets. We continue to expand our global marketing reach. We have a manufacturer’s representative in the Korean market as well as the Taiwan and China markets. We use various distribution channels to reach end user markets, including direct sales by our employees, independent manufacturers’ representatives in the United States, and independent distributors and manufacturers’ representatives for international markets. Also, the internet provides tremendous reach for new customers to be able to identify us as a source of their product needs.
 
In October 2016, we launched a new corporate website, www.sciengineeredmaterials.com, with increased content and functionality. The new website is designed to serve customers, suppliers and investors with additional information in an easy to use format and includes expanded mobile access. There are also social media components, including LinkedIn®, Google Plus and Facebook®, to enhance the Company’s visibility and communication with all stakeholders. For customers and suppliers, there is expanded information about our product focus as well as a library of detailed product data sheets that will continue to be updated and added going forward. Investors can continue to access current and archived information about the Company utilizing multiple electronic platforms.

Ceramics
 
We are capable of producing ceramic powders via several different processing techniques including solid state and precipitation. Ceramic targets can also be produced in a variety of ways depending on the end user applications. Production techniques include sintering, cold isostatic pressing and hot pressing.
 
Most of our products are manufactured from component chemicals and metal oxides supplied by various vendors. If we suddenly lost the services of a supplier, there could be a disruption in our manufacturing process until the supplier was replaced. We have identified several firms as potential back-up suppliers that would be capable of supplying these materials to us as necessary.
 
Metals
 
In addition to the ceramic targets previously mentioned, we produce metal sputtering targets and backing plates. The targets are often bonded to the backing plates for application in the PVD industry. These targets can be produced by casting, hot pressing and machining of metals and metal alloys depending on the application.
 
Applications for metal targets are highly varied from applying decorative coatings for end uses such as sink faucets to the production of various electronic, photonic and semiconductor products.
 
We purchase various metals of reasonable high purity (often above 99.9%) for our applications. We are not dependent on a single source for these metals and do not believe losing a vendor would materially affect our business.
 
We have continually added production processes and testing equipment to enable us to manufacture and qualify many product compositions that can be used as PVD materials.
 
Competition
 
We have a number of domestic and international competitors in both the ceramic and metal fields, many of whom have resources far in excess of our resources. Tosoh, Materion Corporation and Kurt Lesker are competing suppliers in regard to targets.
Suppliers
 
Principal suppliers in 2017 were Johnson Matthey, Six Nine Materials and Silicon-HQ. In every case, we have established alternate vendors that can be used to ensure availability of required materials. As volume grows, we may enter into alliances or purchasing contracts with these or other vendors.
Research and Development
 
We are developing sputtering targets for transparent electronic applications, which could be used to produce transparent thin film transistors via PVD processing. We have ongoing development for product improvements and new Transparent Conductive Oxide (TCO) for Thin Film Solar and wide area coating applications. Much of the development for these new products is based on doping zinc oxide (ZnO). We have developed considerable expertize working with ZnO from our aluminum zinc oxide (AZO) development. We are also developing a dielectric material for semiconductor applications. We focus our research and development efforts in areas that build on our core competencies.
 
We have new materials under development that may replace the Cadmium Sulfide buffer layer in CIGS solar cells. These materials were tested at Case Western Reserve University and the results support the use of our innovative material in thin film solar applications that could lead to higher efficiencies.
 
We may seek funded research opportunities within our core competencies that maintain and expand technical understanding within our company.
 
We had a collaborative program with Kent State University to evaluate our TCO materials in liquid crystal display applications which began in 2014 and ended during 2016.
 
We have certain proprietary knowledge and trade secrets related to the manufacture of metal and metal oxide PVD materials.

New Product Initiatives
 
We continue to develop TCO target materials for the Thin Film Solar market in partnership with both original equipment manufacturers and Thin Film Solar Cell panel fabricators.  A combination of Third Frontier grants and loans provided by the Ohio Department of Development and the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority enabled us to accelerate both our development of new products and expanding our manufacturing capacity to meet demands in an evolving marketplace. In addition, we have developed a Zinc Magnesium Oxide material that may be used as a buffer layer material in Copper Indium Gallium Diselenide (CIGS) solar cells.
 
Our research and development team includes two Ph.D.’s. One member of the team has a degree in material science and the other holds a doctorate in Physics. This diverse knowledge base is essential for our products to be successful. Our team provides a deeper understanding of the optical and electrical properties in the various applications. The applications in which we are involved require a deeper understanding than only the material properties.
 
We continue to pursue research and development opportunities with respect to new and innovative materials and processes to be used in connection with the production of solid state Thin Film Batteries.  Presently, there are a few manufacturers of Thin Film Batteries in the United States, each in various stages of development from prototype to commercial activity.  In addition, globally there are several firms and research institutes conducting tests on Thin Film Batteries.  We believe this market may potentially become large with growth expected during the next few years.  There are numerous applications for Thin Film Batteries, including, but not limited to, active RFID tags, battery on chip, portable electronics, medical implant devices, remote sensors and wearable devices.  Given the many potential uses for Thin Film Batteries, we anticipate that the market for materials will grow in direct proportion to the Thin Film Battery market itself. We currently face competition from other producers of materials used in connection with the manufacture of Thin Film Batteries. We believe that we have certain competitive advantages in terms of quality.  We intend to actively market our materials to Thin Film Battery producers in the upcoming year in order to maintain our strong presence in this market. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have received a patent for Fine-Particle Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O Having High Phase Purity made by a Chemical Precipitation and Low-Pressure Calcination method from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  We also have received a patent for a process to join two individual strongly linked super-conductors utilizing a melt processing technique.
 
We have the rights to multiple patent applications and any subsequent patents for technology related to the application of Zinc Oxide based Transparent Conductive Oxide in Displays.
 
In 2017, we filed an application for a patent for Process for the Removal of Chromium Contaminants from Ruthenium Sputtering Target Substrates.
 
In the future, we may submit additional patent applications covering various inventions which have been developed by us.  Because the publication of U.S. patent applications can be delayed for up to one year, they tend to lag behind actual discoveries and we may not be the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications for such inventions.  Additionally, other parties may independently develop similar technologies, duplicate our technologies or, if patents are issued to us or rights licensed by us, design around the patented aspects of any technologies we developed or licensed.
 
We rely on a combination of patent and trademark law, license agreements, internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property.  Unfortunately, these may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
 
Employees
 
We had 18 full-time employees as of December 31, 2017. One of these employees holds a PhD in Material Science and another holds a PhD in Physics. One of these individuals has expertise in application for the Display market. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with employees to be good. The employees do not have a bargaining unit.

Environmental Matters
 
We handle all materials according to federal, state and local environmental regulations and include Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with all shipments to customers.  We maintain a collection of MSDS sheets for all raw materials used in the manufacture of products and maintenance of equipment and insure that all personnel follow the handling instructions contained in the MSDS for each material.  We contract with a reputable fully permitted hazardous waste disposal company to dispose of the small amount of hazardous waste generated.
Collections and Write-offs
 
We collected receivables in an average of 37 days in 2017. We have occasionally been forced to write-off negligible amount of accounts receivable as uncollectible. There were none in 2017 and 2016. We consider credit management critical to our success.
Seasonal Trends
 
We have not experienced and do not expect to experience seasonal trends in future business operations.
