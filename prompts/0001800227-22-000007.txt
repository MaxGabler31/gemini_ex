OVERVIEW
Who We Are 
IAC is today comprised of Dotdash Meredith, Angi Inc. and Care.com, as well as a number of other businesses ranging from early stage to established.
As used herein, “IAC,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” and other similar terms refer to IAC/InterActiveCorp and its subsidiaries (unless the context requires otherwise).
Our History 
IAC began as a hybrid media/electronic retailing company over twenty-five years ago. Since then, IAC (directly and through predecessor entities) has transformed itself into a leading Internet company through the development, building, acquisition and distribution to its stockholders of a number of businesses over two decades, and IAC continues to build companies and invest opportunistically.
From and after the late 1990s, we acquired a number of e-commerce companies, including Ticketmaster Group (later renamed Ticketmaster), Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), Expedia.com, Match.com, LendingTree (later renamed Tree.com, Inc.), TripAdvisor, HomeAdvisor and AskJeeves, as well as Interval International (later renamed Interval Leisure Group, Inc.).
In 2005, we completed the separation of our travel and travel-related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. (now known as Expedia Group, Inc.). In 2008, we separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc. (now part of Qurate Retail, Inc.), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. (now part of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation), Ticketmaster (now known as Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.) and Tree.com, Following this transaction, we continued to invest in and acquire e-commerce companies, including About.com (later renamed Dotdash) and a number of online dating companies in the United States and various jurisdictions abroad.
In 2017, we completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor financial reporting segment with those of Angie’s List, Inc. under a new publicly traded holding company, ANGI Homeservices Inc. (now known as Angi Inc.), that we control. And in 2018, through this entity we acquired Handy Technologies, Inc., a leading platform in the United States for connecting consumers looking for household services (primarily cleaning and handyman services) with top-quality, pre-screened independent service professionals.
In February 2020, we acquired Care.com, the leading online destination for families to easily connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes and for a wide variety of caregivers to easily connect with families. In June 2020, we completed the separation of our online dating businesses into an independent, separately traded public company called Match Group, Inc. In August 2020, we announced that we had acquired an approximate 12% interest in MGM Resorts International, a leader in gaming, hospitality and leisure (“MGM”), for an aggregate of approximately $1 billion. 
In May 2021, we completed the spin-off of our full stake in our Vimeo business (the “Spin-off”). Following the Spin-off, Vimeo, Inc. (formerly Vimeo Holdings, Inc. (“Vimeo”)) became an independent, separately traded public company. In December 2021, through Dotdash Media Inc., we completed the acquisition of Meredith Holdings Corp., owner of a portfolio of publishing brands, such as PEOPLE, Better Homes & Gardens, FOOD & WINE, Allrecipes, Southern Living and InStyle. Following the acquisition, we refer to the combined entity, which operates the brands and businesses of our former Dotdash financial reporting segment and those of Meredith Holdings Corp., as Dotdash Meredith.

In addition, as a result of the Voting Agreement, Mr. Levin is currently in a position, subject to IAC’s organizational documents and Delaware law, to influence his election to IAC's board of directors and influence the outcome of Contingent Matters (as defined in the Voting Agreement).

Digital
Our Digital business delivers digital content through our portfolio of brands that have leadership in the subject areas that we believe matter most to our consumer audiences (including entertainment, food, home, beauty, travel, health, family, luxury and fashion). Through our Digital business, we provide original and engaging digital content in a variety of formats, including articles, illustrations, videos and images, working with hundreds of experts in their respective fields to create content (including doctors, chefs and certified financial advisors, among others) and produce thousands of pieces of original content that we publish across our portfolio of brands on a monthly basis. 
Print
Through our Print business, we are a leading magazine publisher in the United States. In 2021, our Print business published 30 magazines, as well as more than 350 special interest publications (which numbers include magazines and special interest publications published in 2021 prior to our acquisition of Meredith Holdings Corp. in December 2021).
Our Print editorial teams create premium content covering subjects that we believe matter most to our consumer audience in a format that we believe consumers enjoy for its convenience and thoughtful editorial curation. The majority of the publishing brands and content within our Print business is focused on interests related to women and lifestyle (for example, PEOPLE, Better Homes & Gardens and Southern Living). Our special interest publications provide in-depth information, education and entertainment on single topics and trends that we believe are timely and relevant to our consumer audience (including food, home, entertainment, and health and wellness). Most of our special interest publications have a high ratio of editorial to advertising content and are premium priced (for consumers) at between $10 and $15 each.
We distribute our magazines on a subscription basis (both direct and via agency partners) and through newsstands, with the majority of distribution occurring on a subscription basis. We had approximately 35 million active subscriptions at December 31, 2021 and the majority of our subscription brands are issued between four and twelve times annually. Through newsstands, we sell single copies of our subscription titles and special interest publications. 
  Revenue
Dotdash Meredith revenue consists of digital and print revenue. Digital revenue consists principally of display advertising, performance marketing and licensing and other revenue. Print revenue consists principally of subscription, newsstand, print advertising and performance marketing revenue.
Display advertising revenue is generated primarily through digital display advertisements sold directly by Dotdash Meredith's sales team and programmatic advertising networks. Performance marketing revenue includes commissions generated through affiliate commerce, affinity marketing and performance marketing channels. Affiliate commerce and performance marketing commission revenue is generated when Dotdash Meredith refers consumers to commerce partner websites. Affinity marketing programs partner with third parties to market and place magazine subscriptions online for both Dotdash Meredith and third party publisher titles where Dotdash Meredith acts as an agent. Licensing revenue includes symbolic licenses, which include direct-to-retail product partnerships based on Dotdash Meredith's brands, and functional licenses, which consist of content licensing. 
In addition to subscription revenue, print revenue includes newsstand revenue, which is related to single copy magazines or bundles of single copy magazines to wholesalers for resale on newsstands, print advertising revenue, which relates to the sale of advertising in magazines directly to advertisers or through advertising agencies, and performance marketing, which principally consists of affinity marketing revenue. Print revenue also includes other revenue streams that are primarily projects based, which may relate to any one or combination of the following activities: advertising audience targeting, custom publishing, content strategy and development, email marketing, social media, database marketing,and search engine optimization. 
Marketing
Our Digital business markets its digital content through a full suite of digital distribution channels, as well as via direct navigation to its various branded websites. Our Print business markets its content through a variety of channels, including through direct mail, search engines, social media, email, web sites, affiliate links and third party partnerships. We prefer a subscription-focused distribution approach in the case of our Print business because we believe that it fosters long-term direct relationships with consumers and creates greater monetization opportunities.
Competition
Our Digital business is characterized by ever evolving technology, frequent product evolution and changing preferences of consumers, advertisers and marketers. Digital media is intensely competitive, particularly for consumer attention (both attracting and retaining), driving traffic to our various Digital brands through search engines (and the display of information from such brands (and links to websites offering our content) within search engine results) and spending from advertisers and marketers. In the case of our Digital business, competitors primarily include diversified multi-platform media companies, other online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories, news aggregators, search engines and social media platforms. Some of these competitors may have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger user bases and/or greater financial, technical or marketing resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their digital content, which could result in greater market acceptance of their digital content relative to ours. 
Publishing is a highly competitive business. Our print magazines and related publishing products and services compete primarily with other print magazine publishers, as well as other mass media, including the Internet and many other leisure-time activities. While competition is strong for established brands, gaining readership for newer magazines and specialty publications is especially competitive.
We believe that the ability of our Digital and Print businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the ability to maintain and grow our large reach to American consumers;
•the quality of the content and editorial features in our Digital and Print publications;
•the ability of our publishing brands to have recognized expertise and authority in each of our verticals and continue to create content and experiences that are useful, relevant and entertaining to our consumer audiences;
•the amount of traffic we attract to our various digital publishing brands through search engines (and how prominently information from such brands (and links to websites offering our content) are displayed in search engine results);
•the ability to continue to build and maintain brand recognition, trust and loyalty across our portfolio of publishing brands; 
•the usefulness, performance and visibility of our publishing brands across digital and other platforms relative to our competitors; 
•the ability to continue to grow and diversify our monetization solutions, including advertising, e-commerce and affiliate relationships, performance marketing and other solutions;
•the ability to leverage our proprietary platforms and data to provide consumers with performant and relevant sites and experiences that are respectful (with targeted and limited ads) and privacy compliant; 
•the ability to maintain and grow relationships with advertisers, in the case of our Digital business, through performant ads, targeting audiences and unique branded offerings, all with efficient reach to influence branding through to purchase, and in the case of our Print business, which will depend on:
•the rates we charge for print advertising;
•the circulation levels of magazines and the profit derived from such circulation;
•the breadth of our demographic reach in terms of readership; and
•our ability to consistently provide advertisers and marketers with a compelling return on their investments;
•the ability to grow our e-commerce related content and experiences, to leverage our publishing brands and expertise to help consumers purchase products; and 
• in the case of our Print business:
•our ability to retain existing subscribers and successfully drive new consumers to our magazines in a cost-effective manner; 
•our ability to maintain print advertising rate cards and the number of pages sold by brand and issue; 
•the prices we charge for our magazines; and
•our ability to provide quality customer service to advertisers, marketers and subscribers.
Angi Inc.
 Overview
Our Angi Inc. segment includes the North American (United States and Canada) and European businesses and operations of Angi Inc., a publicly traded company that was formed as ANGI Homeservices Inc. in September 2017 to facilitate the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor financial reporting segment and Angie’s List, Inc. In March 2021, ANGI Homeservices Inc. changed its name to Angi Inc. and updated one of its leading websites and brands (Angie’s List) to Angi, and concentrated its marketing investment on the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales and branding efforts on a single brand. As of December 31, 2021, IAC’s economic interest and voting interest in Angi Inc. were 84.5% and 98.2%, respectively.
Angi Inc.’s North American businesses and operations include Angi Ads (formerly known as Angie’s List), Angi Leads (formerly known as HomeAdvisor) and Angi Services (which consists primarily of Handy Technologies, Inc. (“Handy”) and Angi Roofing, LLC (“Angi Roofing”)) in the United States. Through these businesses and operations, the Angi brand collectively connects quality home service professionals with consumers across more than 500 different categories, from repairing and remodeling homes to cleaning and landscaping, in 64 discrete geographic areas in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2021, over 240,000 service professionals actively sought consumer leads, completed jobs or advertised work through these businesses and operations and consumers turned to at least one Angi business to find a service professional for approximately 33 million projects.
In addition to Angi Inc.’s leading businesses and operations in the United States, Angi Inc. owns leading home services online marketplaces in France (Travaux), Germany (MyHammer), Netherlands (Werkspot) and Italy (Instapro), owns controlling stakes in leading home services online marketplaces in the United Kingdom (MyBuilder) and Canada (HomeStars), and has operations in Austria through its MyHammer business.
Services
Overview. Our Angi Ads business connects consumers with service professionals for local services through a nationwide online directory of service professionals. Our Angi Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, matches consumers with independently established home services professionals engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services and provides consumers with tools that enable them to communicate with service professionals and pay for related services directly through Angi platforms. Through our Angi Services business, consumers can browse and buy common household services at set prices directly from Angi rather than requesting quotes from service professionals (which we refer to as pre-priced offerings), as well as instantly book related appointments with service professionals online for household services. All services booked through our Angi Services business are provided by pre-screened, independent service professionals engaged directly by Angi platforms. The matching and pre-priced booking services and related tools and directories are provided to consumers free of charge. Angi Services also include roof replacement services fulfilled by Angi Roofing. 
As of December 31, 2021, Angi had a network of approximately 206,000 transacting service professionals (each of whom paid for consumer matches through Angi Leads and/or performed an Angi Services job in the quarter). In addition, our Angi Ads businesses had approximately 38,000 advertising service professionals under contract for advertising as of December 31, 2021.
Angi Ads. Through our Angi Ads business, we connect consumers with service professionals for local services through the Angi nationwide online directory of service professionals across more than 500 different categories, as well as provide consumers with valuable tools, services and content (including verified reviews of local service professionals), to help them research, shop and hire for local services. Consumers can access the Angi nationwide online directory and related basic tools and services free of charge upon registration, as well as by way of purchased membership packages. Our Angi Ads business also sells term-based website and mobile and digital magazine advertising to service professionals. 
Consumers who register for free with our Angi Ads business can search for a service professional in the Angi nationwide online directory and/or be matched with a service professional, as well as access related basic tools and services, ratings and reviews and certain promotions. In addition, two premium membership packages are available for a fee, which packages include varying degrees of online and phone support and access to exclusive promotions, features and an award-winning digital magazine. 
Consumers can rate service professionals listed in the Angi nationwide online directory on a one- to five- star rating scale, based on a variety of criteria (including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism), as well as provide commentary regarding their experiences with service professionals. Ratings and reviews cannot be submitted anonymously, and there are processes in place to prevent service professionals from reporting on themselves or their competitors, as well as to detect fraudulent or otherwise problematic reviews.
In addition to the consumer services described above, our Angi Ads business provides service professionals with a variety of services and tools, including certification, as well as quoting, invoicing and payment services. Generally, service professionals with an average consumer rating below a “3” are not eligible for certification. Service professionals must satisfy certain criteria for certification, including retaining the requisite member rating, and owners or principals of businesses affiliated with service professionals must pass certain criminal background checks and attest to applicable licensure requirements. Once eligibility criteria are satisfied, service professionals must then purchase term-based advertising to obtain certification. If a certified service professional fails to meet any eligibility criteria during the applicable advertising contract term, refuses to participate in Angi's complaint resolution process and/or engages in what is determined to be prohibited behavior, existing advertising and exclusive promotions will be suspended, and the related advertising contract will be subject to termination.
Certified service professionals rotate among the first service professionals listed in the Angi nationwide online directory search results for an applicable category, together with their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information. When consumers choose to be matched with a service professional, Angi's proprietary algorithm will determine where a given service professional appears within related results.
Angi Leads. Through our Angi Leads business, we operate a digital marketplace (formerly known as the HomeAdvisor Marketplace and now known as HomeAdvisor powered by Angi) that connects consumers with service professionals nationwide for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. Our Angi Leads business provides consumers with tools and resources to help them find local, pre-screened and customer-rated service professionals, as well as instantly book appointments online, connect with service professionals instantly by telephone and access several home services-related resources, such as cost guides for different types of home services projects. 
Consumers can submit a request to be matched with a service professional through the Angi Leads digital marketplace, as well as through certain paths on the Angi Ads and various third party affiliate platforms. Depending on the nature of the service request and the path through which it was submitted, consumers are generally matched with service professionals from the Angi Leads digital marketplace, an Angi Services service professional or a combination of Angi Leads and Angi Ads service professionals (as and if available for the given service request). Matches made through our Angi Leads and Angi Ads businesses and various third party affiliate platforms and paths are made by way of Angi’s proprietary algorithm based on several factors, including the type of services desired, location and the number of service professionals available to fulfill the request. 
In all cases, service professionals may contact consumers with whom they have been matched directly and consumers can generally review profiles, ratings and reviews of presented service professionals and select the service professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs. Consumers are under no obligation to work with any service professional(s) referred by or found through any Angi branded or third party affiliate platforms. Consumers are responsible for booking the service and for paying the service professional directly, which can be done by consumers independently or via the Angi Pay function in the Angi Pro Leads mobile app, through which consumers can also finance payments to service providers through a third party. 
In addition to the general matching services described above, our Angi Leads business provides several on-demand services, including Instant Booking and Instant Connect. Consumers can also access an online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types nationwide, as well as a library of home services-related content. 
Angi Leads service professionals pay fees for consumer matches and subscription fees for memberships, which are available for purchase through the Angi sales force. The basic annual membership package includes membership in the Angi Leads digital marketplace, as well as access to consumer leads (for which additional fees are paid) through Angi Leads and Angi Ads platforms and a listing in the Angi Leads online directory and certain other affiliated directories, among other benefits. In addition to the commercial membership terms, in order to be admitted into the Angi Leads network, service professionals must validate their home services experiences, as well as satisfy certain criteria, including the verification of any required state-level licensing credentials and the owner or principal passing certain criminal background checks.
Angi Services. Through our Angi Services business, we provide pre-priced offerings, whereby consumers can submit requests for services through Angi and Handy branded platforms and pay us directly for such services. We began providing pre-priced offerings following our acquisition of Handy in October 2018 and expanded the provision of such offerings through the launch of our Angi Services business in August 2019 and the addition of Angi Roofing in July 2021. Matches are made based on the type of service desired, location and the date and time the consumer wants the service to be provided. Consumers pay Angi Services directly for pre-priced offerings and Angi Services then, in turn, fulfills the request with independently established home services providers engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business that customarily provides such services. 
In certain markets, consumers can also submit requests to book a specific Handy service professional for a given household service. In addition, consumers who purchase furniture, electronics, appliances and other home-related items from select third party retail partners online (and in certain markets, in store) can simultaneously purchase assembly, installation and other related services to be fulfilled by Handy service professionals, which are then paid for directly through the applicable third party retail partner platform.
Angi Services service professionals (including those on the Handy platform) are provided with access to a pool of consumers seeking service professionals. Service professionals must validate their home services experience, as well as satisfy credential verification and a background check (either as an individual professional or as the owner or principal of the business) requirements and maintain an acceptable rating to remain on Angi and Handy platforms. Angi Roofing consumers are identified through lead generation services, as well as organically through consumers that reach out directly. Consumers are able to receive roof replacement and repair services, as well as a warranty on the quality of workmanship.
Revenue
Angi revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by Angi Leads service professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the service professional ultimately provides the requested service). Consumer connection revenue varies based upon several factors, including the service requested, product experience offered, and geographic location of service. Angi revenue is also derived from: (i) sales of time-based website, mobile and call center advertising to service professionals, (ii) Angi Leads service professional membership subscription fees, (iii) membership subscription fees from consumers, (iv) service warranty subscription and other services and (v) revenue from completed jobs sourced through the Angi Services platforms. 
 Marketing
Angi businesses market their various products and services to consumers primarily through digital marketing (primarily search engine marketing (free, or organic, and paid), display advertising and third party affiliate agreements) and traditional offline marketing (national television and radio campaigns), as well as through e-mail. Pursuant to third party affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote Angi products and services (and those of Angi service professionals) on their platforms. In exchange for these efforts, these third parties are paid a fixed fee when visitors from their platforms click through and submit a valid service request through Angi platforms, or when visitors submit a valid service request on the affiliate platform and the affiliate transmits the service request to an Angi platform. Angi businesses also market their products and services to consumers through relationships with select third party retail partners and, to a lesser extent, through partnerships with other contextually related websites and direct mail.
Angi Leads matching services and membership subscriptions and Angi Ads term-based advertising and related products are marketed to service professionals primarily through the Angi sales force. These products and services are also marketed, together with Handy branded products and services and pre-priced offerings and various directories, through paid search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations and manufacturers. 
Both generally and in connection with the brand integration initiative described below, Angi has made (and we expect it will continue to make), substantial investments in digital and traditional offline marketing (with continued expansion into new and existing digital platforms) to consumers and service professionals to promote Angi products and services and drive visitors to Angi platforms and service professionals.
In March 2021, ANGI Homeservices Inc. changed its name to Angi Inc. and updated one of its leading websites and brands (Angie’s List) to Angi, and concentrated its marketing investment on the Angi brand in order to focus its marketing, sales and branding efforts on a single brand.
Angi relies heavily on free, or organic, search results from search engine optimization and paid search engine marketing to drive traffic to its platforms. The brand integration initiative has adversely affected the placement and ranking of Angi websites, particularly Angi.com, in organic search results as the Angi brand does not have the same domain history as Angie’s List. In addition, Angi shifted marketing to support the Angi brand (and away from the HomeAdvisor brand), which has negatively affected the efficiency of Angi's search engine marketing efforts.
Since the beginning of the brand integration initiative, related efforts have had a pronounced negative impact on service requests from organic search results and via mobile applications, which in turn has resulted in increased paid search engine marketing to generate service requests. We expect the pronounced negative impact to organic search results, increased paid search engine marketing costs and reduced monetization from mobile applications to continue until such time as the Angi brand establishes a more optimal search engine optimization ranking and consumer awareness is established. 
 Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, and in many important respects, local in nature. Angi businesses compete with, among others: (i) search engines and online directories, (ii) home and/or local services-related platforms, (iii) providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals and (iv) various forms of traditional offline advertising (primarily local in nature), including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories. Angi businesses also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services. We believe that the biggest competition for Angi businesses comes from the traditional methods most people currently use to find service professionals, which are by word-of-mouth and through referrals.
 We believe that the ability of our Angi businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the ability of Angi to successfully implement the brand integration initiative;
•the ability of the Angi Services business to expand pre-priced booking services, while balancing the overall mix of service requests and directory services on Angi platforms generally;
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of the Angi Leads digital marketplace (in terms of service professional membership and participation) and the breadth of Angi branded online directory listings;
•the ability to consistently generate service requests and pre-priced bookings through Angi businesses and leads through Angi branded online directories that convert into revenue for service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 
•the ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through Angi platforms, including mobile applications (rather than through search engine marketing or via free search engine referrals); 
•the functionality of Angi websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and Angi products and services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as the continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally; and
•the quality and consistency of service professional pre-screening processes and ongoing quality control efforts, as well as the reliability, depth and timeliness of customer ratings and reviews.
Search
Overview
Our Search segment consists of Ask Media Group, a collection of websites providing general search services and information, and our Desktop business, which includes our direct-to-consumer downloadable desktop applications and our business-to-business partnership operations. Ask Media Group’s websites include, among others: Ask.com, a search site with a variety of fresh and contemporary content (celebrities, culture, entertainment, travel and general knowledge); Reference.com, a search and general knowledge content site that provides content across select vertical categories (history, business and finance and geography, among other verticals); Consumersearch.com, a search and content website that provides content designed to simplify the product research process; and Shopping.net, a vertical shopping search site, each of which contains a mix of search services and/or content targeted to various user or segment demographics. 
Products, Services and Content
Through Ask Media Group, we provide search services that generally involve the generation and display on a search results page of a set of hyperlinks to web pages deemed relevant to search queries entered by users. In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to an advertiser’s website. Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by the advertiser and relevancy to the search query. Through certain of Ask Media Group’s various websites, digital content in a variety of formats, primarily articles with images and/or illustrations, as well as slideshows or more in-depth presentations, is also provided in addition to general search services. Display advertisements and/or native advertising (or advertising that matches the look, feel and function of the content alongside which it appears) generally appear alongside digital content.
Through our Desktop business, we primarily own and/or operate a portfolio of legacy (meaning they are no longer actively marketed and distributed to new users) consumer desktop browser applications and websites that provide users with access to a wide variety of online content, tools and services, including new tab search services and the option of default browser search services.

Ask Media Group revenue consists principally of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, as well as from display advertisements appearing alongside content on its various websites and, to a lesser extent, affiliate commerce commission revenue. Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites. The majority of the paid listings displayed by Ask Media Group is supplied to us by Google Inc. (“Google”) pursuant to our services agreement with Google. Pursuant to this agreement, Ask Media Group businesses transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results. This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries. Paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages. Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through an Ask Media Group business and then clicks on a paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with the Ask Media Group business. Ask Media Group recognizes paid listing revenue when it delivers the user's click. In cases where the user’s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs. “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business, Operations and Ownership — Certain of our businesses depend upon arrangements with Google."
Revenue from display advertising is generated through advertisements sold through programmatic advertising networks. Affiliate commerce commission revenue is generated when an Ask Media Group property refers users to commerce partner websites resulting in a purchase or transaction.
Revenue from our Desktop business largely consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries. The majority of the paid listings displayed are supplied to us by Google in the manner, and pursuant to the services agreement with Google, described above. To a lesser extent, Desktop revenue also includes fees paid by subscribers for downloadable desktop applications, as well as display advertisements.
Marketing
Ask Media Group’s various properties are marketed primarily through the acquisition of traffic from major search engines and their syndication networks, which involves the purchase of keyword-based sponsored listings that link to search results pages of Ask Media Group properties, and other types of display media (primarily banner advertisements). 
Ask Media Group content is also marketed through a variety of digital distribution channels, including search engines, social media platforms, display advertising networks and native advertising networks, as well as a number of advertising agencies that acquire traffic via these channels for certain Ask Media Group properties. 
Our search powered desktop applications were historically marketed to users primarily through business-to-business partnerships and to a lesser extent digital display advertisements and paid search engine marketing efforts.
Competition
In the case of general search services, Ask Media Group’s competitors include major search engines and other destination search websites and search-centric portals that engage in marketing efforts similar to those of Ask Media Group. In the case of content, Ask Media Group’s competitors primarily include online publishers and destination websites with brands in similar vertical content categories and social channels. We believe that Ask Media Group’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon: 
•its continued ability to monetize search traffic via paid search listings; 
•its continued ability to market its search websites in a cost-effective manner;
•the relevance and authority of search results, answers and other content displayed on its various properties; 
•its continued ability to differentiate Ask Media Group search websites (which depends primarily upon it continued ability to deliver quality, authoritative and trustworthy content to users), as well as the ability to attract advertisers to these websites;
•its ability to successfully create or acquire content (or the rights thereto) in a cost-effective manner; and
•its ability to monetize content pages with display and native advertising and other forms of digital advertising.
Emerging & Other
 Overview
 Our Emerging & Other segment primarily includes:
•Care.com, a leading online destination for families to easily connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes and for a wide variety of caregivers to easily connect with families. Care.com's brands include Care For Business, Care.com offerings to enterprises and HomePay. Care.com acquired Lifecare, a leading provider of family care benefits, on October 27, 2020; 
•Mosaic Group, a leading developer and provider of global subscription mobile applications. Mosaic Group has a portfolio of some of the largest and most popular applications in the following verticals: Communications (RoboKiller, TapeACall), Language (iTranslate, Grammatica), Weather (Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live, Weather Live), Business (PDF Hero, Scan Hero), Health (Daily Burn, Window - Intermittent Fasting) and Lifestyle (Blossom, Pixomatic);

 Care.com
Overview. Through Care.com, we are a leading online destination for families to easily connect with caregivers for their children, aging parents, pets and homes and for a wide variety of caregivers to easily connect with families. Care.com is building a premier destination for families, caregivers and enterprises (through which they can provide care-related benefits to their employees) that features a portfolio of products and services spanning the entire care journey, including guidance for care options, a marketplace for searching for and connecting with caregivers for a wide range of care options (such as a nannies for children or companions for seniors), care management features and access to care-related activities and resources. 
Services. Through Care.com, we primarily offer online consumer matching and consumer payment solutions for families searching for care for their loved ones and enterprise solutions (Care For Business) for companies seeking to provide care-related benefits to their employees.
•Consumer matching solutions. Through free and paid memberships to consumer matching services, Care.com offers a variety of resources designed to match and guide families toward the best care for their loved ones. Resources include online matches with potential caregivers and related resources, augmented by assistance from subject matter experts. Free basic membership provides families with the ability to set up an account, post a job, search and review caregiver profiles and receive applications from caregivers. To engage with caregivers, families must upgrade to a paid premium membership which includes all basic membership features, plus the ability to contact caregivers to schedule interviews, purchase additional background checks, reply to applications and messages from caregivers and access certain promotions and discounts. 
Through our consumer matching solutions, families can match with caregivers (in-home and out-of-home) who meet their diverse and evolving care needs (full-time, part-time, long-term, short-term and occasional at irregular intervals). Matching is facilitated by algorithms designed to highlight the most relevant caregiver(s) (based on user-generated content regarding the type and frequency of care requested, hourly rate for the job and responsibilities and other job requirements), as well as an internally monitored messaging system. In-home caregivers create and post detailed Care.com profiles that include photos, bios, work histories and reviews, the type of care they primarily provide, their experience, certifications and qualifications and their availability, hourly rate and payment details, among other information. Before caregivers with Care.com profiles can communicate directly with consumers seeking care, they must complete a CareCheck background check (conducted by a third party consumer reporting agency). We also offer families and caregivers the ability to purchase multiple levels of additional background check options through third party consumer reporting agencies. While we strongly believe that CareCheck and additional background checks are good practice and recommend them to families and caregivers, they have limitations and, even with these safety measures, no assurances can be provided regarding the future behavior of any caregiver on our platform. 
We also maintain a safety center that provides resources and information designed to help families and caregivers make safer and more informed hiring and job selection decisions, including recommendations to families for screening, interviewing and ongoing monitoring of caregivers, as well as recommendations to caregivers for avoiding scams. We also encourage members to contact us if they believe another member may have violated our community guidelines. 
Out-of-home care-related businesses (such as daycare centers, senior care facilities, tutoring companies, camps and activities) can also market their services through Care.com.
•Consumer payment solutions. Through Care.com, we also offer consumer payments solutions that provide families with several options to manage their financial relationship with their caregiver, as well as help caregivers professionalize and manage their careers. These payment solutions include: 
•HomePay, our payroll and tax product for families who employ nannies, housekeepers or other domestic employees. HomePay, a leader in the space, is a technology-based, turnkey service that includes automated payroll processing, as well as household employer-related tax filings at the federal, state and local levels in the case of caregivers who earn income that is above the annual reportable threshold amount that would require them to make tax filings. Facilitating household employer-related tax filings helps to ensure that families are able to avail themselves of certain tax credits and savings for care related costs, and ensure that caregivers who are paid legally can access unemployment insurance and social security benefits. HomePay is available to anyone (not just members of our consumer matching solutions) for a fee; and 
•our peer-to-peer payments solution, which enables families to make electronic payments to their caregivers directly through our platform or mobile applications. We believe that this solution is particularly applicable to (and helpful in the case of) families who pay caregivers who provide care services at irregular intervals (such as babysitters, after-school caregivers or tutors, or in varying amounts each time services are performed).
•Enterprise solutions. Through Care.com, we also offer Care For Business, a comprehensive suite of services that employers can offer as an employee benefit. Currently, employers can choose from a number of services, including:
• our consumer matching solutions; 
• back-up care services (in-home and in-center) for employees who need alternative care arrangements for their child or senior when their regular care is not available (for example, school closures or the illness of their child or regular caregiver); and 
•access to consultation and referral services to support a wide array of work-life challenges faced by employees, such as senior care planning services to assist employees with finding the most suitable care option for their aging family member; access to mental health experts and resources; tutoring and college prep assistance; lactation support; relocation services; and financial guidance and legal services, among many others. 
Employers generally pay for our enterprise solutions on a per employee per year basis and have access to features that allow them to manage employee access and track aggregate usage. Depending on the suite of services selected and the employer’s preference, the employer may subsidize all, a portion or none of the cost of these solutions for employees. Additionally, employers may add services during the term of their contract on an as needed basis to enhance the support they provide to their employees. 
Revenue. Care.com generates revenue primarily through subscription fees from families and caregivers for its suite of products and services, as well as through annual contracts with corporate employers who provide access to Care.com's suite of products and services as an employee benefit and through contracts with businesses that recruit employees through its platform.
Marketing. Care.com markets its various products and services to families and caregivers through a diverse mix of free and paid offline and online marketing, as well as its sales team. We believe that most families and caregivers currently find Care.com through unpaid marketing channels, primarily through word-of-mouth, referrals and online communities and forums, as well as search engine marketing (free and paid) and repeat users. Paid direct marketing efforts include offline channels, such as network and cable TV, OTT channels and direct mail, as well as through paid search engine marketing, display advertising, third party affiliate agreements and select paid job board sites. In addition, Care.com markets its employee-benefit product offerings directly to enterprises through its sales team. 
Competition. In the case of consumer matching solutions, Care.com primarily competes with traditional offline consumer resources for finding caregivers, as well as online job boards and other online care marketplaces. We believe Care.com’s biggest competition comes from the traditional offline methods through which most consumers find caregivers, which are by word-of-mouth, referrals and online communities and forums. In the case of payment solutions, Care.com primarily competes with similar products offered by providers of online and offline payroll services. Care.com also competes for a share of the overall recruiting and advertising budgets of care-related businesses with traditional, offline media companies and other online marketing providers. In the case of Care For Business, Care.com primarily competes with other providers of employer-sponsored care services and employee benefit products, particularly those that provide back-up child and senior care services.
We believe that Care.com’s ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors: 
•the size, quality, diversity and stability of its network of families and caregivers;
•the functionality and reliability of its websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features (and Care.com’s various products and services) generally to families and caregivers;
•its continued ability to innovate and introduce new products and services that resonate with families and caregivers;
•the quality, completeness and consistency of caregiver profiles and job postings, as well the reliability of background check and other security measures and trustworthiness and reliability of caregivers;
•its ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, Care.com brands
•its ability to continue expand its enterprise solutions business; and
•its ability to continue to expand its businesses in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Mosaic Group 
Overview. Through Mosaic Group, we are a leading developer and provider of global subscription mobile applications. As of December 31, 2021, Mosaic Group had approximately 3.7 million mobile paying subscribers.
Though Mosaic Group and its subsidiaries, we operated 44 branded mobile applications in over 28 languages across 192 countries as of December 31, 2021. These branded mobile applications consist of some of the largest and most popular applications in the following verticals: Communications (RoboKiller, TapeACall), Language (iTranslate, Grammatica), Weather (Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live, Weather Live), Business (PDF Hero, Scan Hero), Health (Daily Burn, Window - Intermittent Fasting) and Lifestyle (Blossom, Pixomatic). Robokiller thwarts both telemarketing and illegal spam phone calls and TapeACall provides prime-quality call recordings services. Through iTranslate, subscribers can connect and communicate across numerous languages, and Grammatica provides AI-powered writing assistant services, including grammar, spelling and punctuation checks. Clime: NOAA Weather Radar Live provides up-to-date weather information and storm tracking worldwide and Weather Live provides customized weather forecasts based on user selected parameters. Through PDF Hero, users can annotate and store all of their PDF files in one place, and through Scan Hero, users can create, sign and edit PDFs by way of the camera on their mobile phones. Daily Burn provides streaming fitness and workout videos and Window-Intermittent Fasting Productive tracks the times between end of/start of fasts. Blossom provides plant identification and content on plant care and Pixomatic is a photo editing application. Mosaic Group’s various branded mobile applications are distributed to subscribers primarily through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 
We believe that Mosaic Group has the personnel, systems and expertise necessary to continue to build and scale leading mobile applications and grow mobile subscription businesses. By applying these resources and skills to both organically developed and acquired mobile applications, Mosaic Group has demonstrated success in scaling mobile applications across a wide variety of utility and productivity categories. 
Revenue. Mosaic Group revenue consists primarily of fees paid by subscribers for downloadable mobile applications distributed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and directly from consumers, as well as display advertisements.
Marketing. We market our mobile applications to users primarily through digital storefronts (primarily the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) and digital display advertisements on social media, messaging and media platforms, as well as in-app and cross-app advertising.
Competition. The applications industry is competitive and has no single, dominant desktop or mobile application brand globally. We believe that the ability of Mosaic Group to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
•the continued growth of consumer adoption of free and paid mobile applications generally and related engagement levels; 
•its ability to operate its various mobile applications as a scalable platform; 
•its ability to retain existing subscribers and acquire new subscribers in a cost-effective manner; 
•its ability to market and distribute its mobile applications through third party digital app stores, including the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, in a cost-effective manner;
•its ability to continue to optimize its marketing and monetization strategies;
•the continued growth of smartphone adoption in certain regions of the world, particularly emerging markets; 
•the continued strength of Mosaic Group brands; and 
•its ability to introduce new and enhanced mobile applications in response to competitor offerings, consumer preferences, platform demands, social trends and evolving technological landscape.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets, and regard this intellectual property as critical to our success. We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from October 2022 to November 2035.
We have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew (or secure by contract where appropriate) trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate. We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections (as and if we deem appropriate) based on then current facts and circumstances, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We rely on a combination of internal and external controls, including applicable laws, rules and regulations, and restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish, protect and otherwise control our various intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad involving matters that are important to (or may otherwise impact) our various businesses, such as broadband internet access, online commerce, privacy and data security, advertising, intermediary liability, consumer protection, taxation, worker classification and securities compliance. These domestic and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are continually evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations (and any amended, proposed or new laws and regulations) are often uncertain, particularly in the Internet industry, and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and over time, which could result in conflicts with our current policies and practices and those of our various businesses.
Because we conduct substantially all of our business on the Internet, we are particularly sensitive to laws and regulations that could adversely impact the popularity or growth in use of the Internet and/or online products and services generally, restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact whether or how we may provide our products and services, regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our products and services and/or undermine an open and neutrally administered Internet access. For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) adopted the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. This order, which was released in January 2018 and took effect in June 2018, reversed net neutrality protections in the United States that had been in place since 2015, including the repeal of specific rules against blocking, throttling or “paid prioritization” of content or services by Internet service providers. Also, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“Section 230”), which generally provides immunity for website publishers from liability for third party content appearing on their platforms and the good faith removal of third party content from their platforms that they may deem obscene or offensive (even if constitutionally protected speech), since its adoption has been (and continues to be) subject to a number of challenges. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could also be narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action or judicial interpretation. In 2018, the U.S. Congress amended Section 230 to remove certain immunities and most recently, in 2020, various members of the U.S. Congress introduced bills to further limit Section 230, and a petition was filed by a Department of Commerce entity with the Federal Communications Commission to commence a rulemaking to further limit Section 230. Any future adverse changes to Section 230 could result in additional compliance costs for us and/or exposure for additional liabilities. In addition, in May 2021, the United Kingdom proposed legislation (specifically, the May 2021 Online Safety Bill) that seeks to create a new regulatory body responsible for establishing duties of care for Internet companies that provide user-generate content and for assessing related compliance.
Because we receive, store and use a substantial amount of information received from or generated by our users and subscribers, we are also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data security, primarily in the case of our operations in the United States and the European Union and the handling of personal data of users located in the United States and the European Union. Recent examples of comprehensive regulatory initiatives in the area of privacy and data security include a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR, which applies to certain companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union, imposes significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance, as well as provides a private right of action for individual claimants. The GDPR will continue to be interpreted by European Union data protection regulators, which may require us to make changes to our business practices and could generate additional risks and liabilities. Data protection regulators in European Union member stated have taken a strict view of cookie consent requirements following the enactment of the GDPR and enforcement actions are on the rise.
In addition, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that had been in place since 2000 for the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to the U.S., and on July 16, 2020, the ECJ invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as an adequate safeguard when transferring personal data from the EEA to the U.S. These regulations continue to evolve and may ultimately require us to devote resources towards compliance and/or make changes to our business practices to ensure compliance, all of which could be costly. Also, the exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling of personal data of users located in the United Kingdom. 
Moreover, while multiple legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of user information are being considered by the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures, certain U.S. state legislatures have already enacted privacy legislation, one of the strictest and most comprehensive of which is the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020 (the “CCPA”). The CCPA provides data privacy rights for California consumers, and restricts the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products, services and operations. The CCPA also provides consumers with a private right of action for security breaches, as well as provides for statutory damages. In addition, on November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24 (the “California Privacy Rights Act of 2020”), which amends certain provisions of the CCPA and becomes effects January 1, 2023, will further restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to use personal California user and subscriber information in connection with their various products, services and operations and/or impose additional operational requirements on such businesses. Virginia and Colorado also passed comprehensive privacy legislation in 2021 that will become effective in 2023, both of which are similar to the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020. Lastly, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to increase its focus on privacy and data security practice and we anticipate this focus to continue. If so, as a result, we could be subject to various private and governmental claims and actions in this area. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations — General Risk Factors — The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs.”
As a provider of certain subscription-based products and services, we are also impacted by laws or regulations affecting whether and how our businesses may periodically charge users for membership or subscription renewals. For example, the European Union Payment Services Directive, which became effective in 2018, could impact the ability of certain of our businesses to efficiently process auto-renewal payments for, as well as offer promotional or differentiated pricing to, users who reside in the European Union. Similar laws exist in the U.S., including the federal Restore Online Shoppers Confidence Act and various U.S. state laws, and legislative and regulatory enactments or amendments are under consideration in a number of U.S. states. The adoption of any law that adversely affects revenue from recurring membership and/or subscription payments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of Dotdash Meredith, Angi, Care.com and Mosaic Group businesses.
We are also sensitive to the adoption of new tax laws. The European Commission and several European countries have recently adopted (or intend to adopt) proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which certain of our European businesses are taxed, including proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes (including taxes based on a percentage of revenue). For example, certain of our businesses are now subject to and pay digital services taxes in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.
In addition, primarily in the case of certain businesses within our Angi Inc. financial reporting segment, we are sensitive to the adoption of worker classification laws, specifically, laws that could effectively require us to change the classification of certain of the service professionals and caregivers affiliated these businesses from independent contractors to employees, as well as changes to state and local laws or judicial decisions relating to the definition and/or classification of independent contractors. For example, California’s worker classification statute (AB 5) effectively narrows the definition of an independent contractor by requiring hiring entities to use a different, stricter test to determine a given worker’s classification. In addition, AB 5 places the burden of proof for classifying workers as independent contractors on hiring entities and provides enforcement powers to the state and certain cities. Also, AB 5 has been the subject of widespread national discussion and it is possible that other jurisdictions may enact similar laws. Since we currently treat certain of the service professionals affiliated with certain businesses within our Angi Inc. financial reporting segment as independent contractors for all purposes, we do not withhold federal, state and local income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments or provide workers’ compensation insurance with respect to such individuals. If we are required as the result of new or amended laws, regulations, interpretations or orders to reclassify these individuals as employees, it could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs, including exposure (for prior and future periods) under federal, state and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest.
Also, in the case of the businesses within our Angi Inc. financial reporting segment, we may be subject to certain U.S. state and local licensure requirements related to the provision of pre-priced offerings. If so, typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority for cause at any time. Moreover, in some jurisdictions, the loss of a license for cause could result in the loss of licenses in other jurisdictions and/or could make it more difficult to obtain new and/or renewal licenses. Obtaining and renewing such license and related compliance could be costly and the failure to comply with licensure requirements could result in bad publicity and related damage to our reputation, brands and brand-building efforts and/or actions by governmental and regulatory authorities and/or litigation, as well as generate additional risks and liabilities (including the imposition of penalties). 
We are also subject to laws, rules and regulations governing the marketing and advertising activities of our various businesses conducted by or through telephone, email, mobile digital devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM act and similar state laws, rules and regulations, as well as local laws, rules and regulations and relevant agency guidelines governing background screening.
Lastly, as a company based in the U.S. with foreign offices in various jurisdictions worldwide, we are subject to a variety of foreign laws governing the foreign operations of its various businesses, as well as U.S. laws that restrict trade and certain practices, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Human Capital 
Overview
IAC’s future success depends upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce across our various businesses worldwide. While policies and practices related to the identification, hiring, development, motivation and retention of employees vary across IAC and our various businesses, at their core, such policies and practices are generally designed to: (i) increase long-term IAC stockholder value by attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding employees with the competence, character, experience, diversity of perspective and ambition necessary to enable the Company to meet its growth objectives, (ii) encourage and support the professional development of, and engender loyalty among, employees who have demonstrated the strength, vision and determination necessary to overcome obstacles and unlock their true professional potential by providing them with appropriate opportunities within IAC and its businesses and (iii) help foster a diverse, inclusive and entrepreneurial culture across our various businesses.
In order to achieve these objectives, we believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and otherwise incentivize employees in unique and attractive ways, as well as develop and promote talent from within and remain committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day.
As of December 31, 2021, IAC had approximately 13,200 employees, substantially all of whom were full-time employees and the substantial majority of whom were based in the United States. Less that 2% of our workforce (all within our Dotdash Meredith financial reporting segment and based outside of the United States) is unionized. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Compensation and Benefits
We believe that we must continue to provide competitive compensation packages and other benefits to our workforce. While compensation packages vary across IAC and our various businesses, compensation packages generally consist of base salary (plus commissions in the case of sales and other similar positions) and annual cash bonuses (on a discretionary basis), and equity or equity-based awards.
We also provide comprehensive health, welfare and retirement benefits. Healthcare benefits are significantly subsidized by the Company and the coverage provided reflects our commitment to inclusivity and the physical and mental well-being of all employees.
In the case of welfare benefits, we maintain generous paid time off and paid leave policies across our businesses and offer subsidized backup child and elder care for our employees. We believe in giving back to the causes and charities that are important to our employees and match charitable contributions made by our employees to qualifying charities on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to an annual cap per employee. We also encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and work and provide our employees with paid time off each year to volunteer for charitable and community service projects.
In the case of retirement benefits, in the U.S., we offer our employees a 401(k) retirement savings program with generous employer matching contributions, subject to an annual cap per employee. We believe that we have a responsibility to encourage (and contribute to) the retirement readiness of each of our employees and believe that this generous 401(k) retirement savings program match is a meaningful commitment to the long-term welfare and security of our workforce.
Talent Development
We generally develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. As a result, senior management across the Company and our businesses generally possesses a great depth of knowledge and experience regarding the Company and our businesses, which is critical for effective succession planning, and with external hires providing a fresh perspective. The human resources teams across the Company and our businesses use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled, talented and diverse employees, and employee referrals for open positions are encouraged.
In addition, we actively seek to identify the next generation of leaders in technology early and often through the IAC Fellows program, a first-of-its-kind program connecting students from under-served and under-resourced backgrounds with academic and leadership opportunities. IAC Fellows join the program as early as high school and stay for up to six years, rotating across a diverse set of IAC businesses during that time in the form of competitively paid internships that put IAC Fellows in the trenches, testing their skills in real world scenarios. Through these experiences, IAC Fellows gain exposure to different business models, functions and roles within IAC, as well as access to IAC senior leadership as mentors and coaches. IAC Fellows also receive an academic stipend following the completion of each paid internship. For those IAC Fellows hired by IAC or any of its businesses following the completion of their paid internships and who stay for a period of three years, IAC will pay off the entirety of their school loans.
To be eligible for the IAC Fellows program, students must be from low-income backgrounds or families with financial need, with eligibility assessed individually based on the composition and income of a given student’s family, and with first-generation college students being given priority consideration. Students must be citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. and possess the following personal attributes: (i) leadership abilities, (ii) a strong interest in science, technology, computer science and/or math, (iii) demonstrated intellectual curiosity and devotion to study, (iv) a hunger to learn and achieve academically and (v) ethics, integrity and strength of character.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to building inclusive workplaces and workforces that reflect the diversity of the global population using our products and services each day. Accordingly, we view diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) efforts as integral to our success. While DE&I efforts, policies and practices vary across our businesses, they include (in addition to the IAC Fellows program discussed above) at certain of our businesses: (i) pay equity analyses conducted on an annual basis to ensure that women and employees from traditionally under-represented groups are not adversely impacted by pay bias, (ii) employee community resource groups (ECGs) led and supported by senior executives (and in certain cases, funded by the relevant business), (iii) incentivizing DE&I by tying bonus structure to diversity goals and metrics and (iv) launching DE&I councils at certain of our businesses that collaborate directly with senior executives to roll out DE&I training, as well to determine ways to diversify product and service experiences, attract a more diverse population of employees and invest in building diverse and equitable local communities.
