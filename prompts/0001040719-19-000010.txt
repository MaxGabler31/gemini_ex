ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
We are an independent servicer and originator of mortgage loans and servicer of reverse mortgage loans. We service a wide array of loans across the credit spectrum for our own portfolio and for GSEs, government agencies, third-party securitization trusts and other credit owners. Through our consumer, correspondent and wholesale lending channels, we originate and purchase residential mortgage loans that we predominantly sell to GSEs and government agencies. We also operate two complementary businesses: asset receivables management and real estate owned property management and disposition. 
We are a Maryland corporation incorporated in 1997 and operate throughout the U.S. In April 2009, we were spun off from Walter Energy. From 2009 through 2014, we grew our servicing and originations businesses both organically and through a number of acquisitions and servicing rights acquisitions. Beginning in 2016, we began to sell our servicing rights while retaining subservicing.
On February 11, 2019, Ditech Holding Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries filed the DHCP Bankruptcy Petitions as contemplated by the DHCP RSA entered into on February 8, 2019 as discussed further below. The Company intends to continue to operate its businesses during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings.
The terms “Ditech Holding,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” as used throughout this report refer to Ditech Holding Corporation (Successor) and its consolidated subsidiaries after the WIMC Effective Date, and/or Walter Investment Management Corp. (Predecessor) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the WIMC Effective Date.
Emergence from the WIMC Reorganization Proceedings
On November 30, 2017, Walter Investment Management Corp. (Predecessor) filed the WIMC Bankruptcy Petition under the Bankruptcy Code to pursue the WIMC Prepackaged Plan announced on November 6, 2017. On January 17, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the amended WIMC Prepackaged Plan and on January 18, 2018, entered a confirmation order approving the WIMC Prepackaged Plan. On February 9, 2018, the WIMC Prepackaged Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and Walter Investment Management Corp. emerged from the WIMC Chapter 11 Case and changed its name to Ditech Holding Corporation (Successor) and on February 12, 2018, our newly issued common stock commenced trading on the NYSE under the symbol DHCP. From and after effectiveness of the WIMC Prepackaged Plan, we have continued, in our previous organizational form, to carry out our business. 
On the WIMC Effective Date, all of our previously existing equity interests, including our Predecessor common stock, were canceled. Our obligations under our previously outstanding Convertible Notes and Senior Notes, except to the limited extent set forth in the WIMC Prepackaged Plan, were also extinguished. Previously outstanding equity and debt interests were exchanged as follows:

• | Senior Notes were exchanged at a rate of 464.11293167 Second Lien Notes and 0.18564517 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes;


• | Convertible Notes were exchanged at a rate of 8.76919841 shares of Successor common stock, 14.94011581 Series A Warrants and 11.85465711 Series B Warrants per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes; and


• | shares of common stock were exchanged at a rate of 0.05689208 shares of Successor common stock, 0.09692659 Series A Warrants and 0.07690920 Series B Warrants per share of Predecessor common stock.

Accordingly, we issued:

• | to the holders of Predecessor shares of common stock, an aggregate of 2,126,250 shares of Successor common stock, 3,622,500 Series A Warrants and 2,874,375 Series B Warrants;


• | to the holders of Senior Notes claims (as defined in the WIMC Prepackaged Plan), $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Second Lien Notes and $100.0 million aggregate initial liquidation preference of Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into common stock at a ratio of 114.9750 per share of preferred stock; and


• | to the holders of Convertible Notes claims (as defined in the WIMC Prepackaged Plan), an aggregate of 2,126,250 shares of Successor common stock, 3,622,500 Series A Warrants and 2,874,375 Series B Warrants.

6

In addition, we authorized and reserved for future issuance:

• | 3,193,750 shares of Successor common stock for issuance under an equity incentive plan;


• | 7,245,000 shares of Successor common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series A Warrants;


• | 5,748,750 shares of Successor common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Series B Warrants; and


• | 11,497,500 shares of Successor common stock issuable upon conversion of the Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock.

As discussed below, pursuant to the DHCP RSA on the DHCP Effective Date, it is anticipated that the holders of the Company's existing equity will have their claims extinguished. Our common stock and warrants have been delisted from the NYSE and are trading on the OTC Pink marketplace.
Pursuant to the terms of the WIMC Prepackaged Plan, we entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement, providing for the 2018 Term Loan in the amount of $1.2 billion. For a period of approximately one year following the WIMC Effective Date, we continued to receive financing through a master repurchase agreement for a maximum committed purchase price of $1.0 billion, used principally to fund Ditech Financial’s mortgage loan origination business, and a master repurchase agreement providing for a maximum committed purchase price of $800.0 million used principally to fund RMS' purchase of HECM loans and foreclosed real estate from certain securitization pools. On April 23, 2018, RMS entered into an additional master repurchase agreement which, as of December 31, 2018, provides up to $412.0 million in total capacity, and a minimum of $400.0 million in committed capacity to fund the repurchase of certain HECMs and real estate owned from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. The interest rate on this facility was based on the applicable index rate plus 3.25%. We also issued variable funding notes under the DAAT Facility and the DPAT II Facility for advances made in connection with certain mortgage loan servicing operations. These facilities had aggregate capacities of $465.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. In addition to the foregoing facility sub-limits, the DAAT Facility, the DPAT II Facility, Ditech Financial’s master repurchase agreement and RMS’s master repurchase agreement were subject, collectively, to a combined maximum outstanding amount of $1.9 billion.
For a more detailed discussion of our emergence, refer to the Emergence from the WIMC Reorganization Proceedings section under Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.
Delisting of our Common Stock
On November 6, 2018, we received notice from the NYSE informing us that the NYSE was commencing proceedings to delist our common stock and warrants from the NYSE and trading of such securities had been suspended as a result of our failure to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30-day trading period of at least $15.0 million. Effective November 7, 2018, our common stock and warrants commenced trading in the OTC Pink marketplace. Effective February 12, 2019, our common stock symbol was changed to DHCPQ due to the filing of the DHCP Bankruptcy Petitions. As discussed further below, we anticipate that on the effective date of the DHCP Reorganization Transaction, our common stock and warrants will be extinguished. There may not be a public market for our common stock and warrants.
For a more detailed discussion of our emergence, refer to the Emergence from the WIMC Reorganization Proceedings section under Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.
DHCP Reorganization Proceedings
Throughout 2018, we continued to forecast reductions in liquidity due to further deterioration of results, driven by the required repayment terms and restrictive covenants of the 2018 Term Loan, further increases in Ginnie Mae buyout loans, an inability to execute on certain transactions, recurring operating losses and negative cash flows in certain of our segments, including unforeseen increased collateral posting requirements and/or negative impacts from market conditions. To address this situation, we became focused on liquidity and cash generation.
In response to certain inquiries received by our Board of Directors, during the second quarter of 2018, our Board of Directors initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives, hereinafter referred to as the Strategic Review. This process was and is being conducted with the assistance of financial and legal advisors. We are considering a range of potential transactions including, among other things, a sale of the Company, a sale of all or a portion of the Company’s assets, and/or a recapitalization of the Company.
Based on analyses we prepared with our financial advisors in connection with the Strategic Review (including analyses of proposals received by us during such review), analyses we prepared from time to time in connection with our internal business planning processes, and the risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact our liquidity plan, during the Strategic Review our management and Board of Directors determined that the actions we had taken and actions that we planned to take to improve our liquidity position may not have been adequate to meet our future obligations.
7

Therefore, in connection with the Strategic Review, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into non-disclosure agreements with, and we along with our financial and legal advisors began to have discussions with, certain of our corporate debt holders and their advisors regarding potential strategic transactions that may involve implementation through an in-court supervised Chapter 11 process.
On January 17, 2019, we received a notice from NRM initiating the process of termination under the NRM Subservicing Agreement. In connection therewith, we have subsequently deboarded certain of the loans we previously subserviced for NRM under the NRM Subservicing Agreement. Any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement would not be effective until a servicing transfer has been completed in accordance with applicable requirements. We are reviewing the grounds for termination in consultation with our stakeholders and are considering all of our options with respect thereto including legal rights and remedies. We are proceeding with our strategic alternatives assuming there is not an ongoing subservicing relationship with NRM. The Company’s plans are not contingent on any continuing relationship with NRM.
On February 8, 2019, Ditech Holding Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors) entered into the DHCP RSA with Consenting Term Lenders holding, as of February 11, 2019, more than 75% of the term loans outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement. 
Pursuant to the DHCP RSA, the Consenting Term Lenders and the Debtors agreed to the principal terms of a financial restructuring, which, as described further below, will be implemented through a prearranged plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and which provides for the restructuring of our indebtedness through the DHCP Reorganization Transaction that is expected to reduce gross corporate debt by over $800 million and provide us with an appropriately sized working capital facility upon emergence.
The DHCP RSA also provides for the continuation of our prepetition review of strategic alternatives, whereby, as a potential alternative to the implementation of the DHCP Reorganization Transaction, any and all bids for our company or our assets will be evaluated as a precursor to confirmation of any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.
The review of strategic alternatives provides a public and comprehensive forum in which the Debtors are seeking bids or proposals for three types of potential transactions, as described below. If a bid or proposal is received representing higher or better value than the DHCP Reorganization Transaction, it will either be incorporated into the DHCP Reorganization Transaction or pursued as an alternative to the DHCP Reorganization Transaction in consultation with the Consenting Term Lenders and subject to the DHCP RSA. The date on which a plan of reorganization is consummated is herein and in the DHCP RSA referred to as the DHCP Effective Date.
The three types of transactions for which bids are being solicited are:

• | a sale transaction meaning, a sale of substantially all of our assets, as provided in the DHCP RSA;


• | an asset sale transaction meaning, the sale of a portion of our assets other than a sale transaction consummated prior to the DHCP Effective Date; provided such sale shall only be conducted with the consent of the Requisite Term Lenders; and


• | a master servicing transaction meaning, as part of the DHCP Reorganization Transaction to the extent the terms thereof are acceptable to the Requisite Term Lenders, entry into an agreement or agreements with an approved subservicer or subservicers whereby, following the DHCP Effective Date, all or substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights are subserviced by such approved subservicers.

The DHCP RSA presently contemplates the following treatment for certain key classes of creditors under the DHCP Reorganization Transaction:

• | DHCP DIP Warehouse Facilities Claims - On the DHCP Effective Date, the holders of DHCP DIP Warehouse Facilities claims will be paid in full in cash;


• | Term Loan Claims - On the DHCP Effective Date, the holders of Term Loan Claims will receive their pro rata share of new term loans under an amended and restated credit facility agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million, and 100% of our New Common Stock, which will be privately held;


• | Second Lien Notes Claims - On the DHCP Effective Date, the holders of the Second Lien Notes will not receive any distribution;


• | Go-Forward Trade Claims - On the DHCP Effective Date, trade creditors identified by us (with the consent of the Requisite Term Lenders) as being integral to and necessary for the ongoing operations of New Ditech will receive a distribution in cash in an amount equaling a certain percentage of their claim, subject to an aggregate cap; and


• | Existing Equity Interests - On the DHCP Effective Date, holders of the Company’s existing preferred stock, common stock, and warrants will have their claims extinguished.

8

If the Debtors proceed to confirmation of a sale transaction, the Debtors will distribute proceeds of such transaction in accordance with the priority scheme under the Bankruptcy Code.
Under the DHCP RSA, on the Election Date, the Electing Term Lenders may deliver an election notice to the Company stating that the Electing Term Lenders wish to consummate an elected transaction as follows: (i) the DHCP Reorganization Transaction, or (ii) master servicing transaction (as part of the DHCP Reorganization Transaction), or (iii) sale transaction, and, if applicable, (iv) in connection and together with an election of (i), (ii), or (iii), any asset sale transaction(s), provided that inclusion of any asset sale transaction(s) is not incompatible with successful consummation of the elected transaction in (i), (ii) or (iii). If the Debtors do not proceed with the elected transaction, the Consenting Term Lenders can terminate the DHCP RSA.
On February 11, 2019, as contemplated by the DHCP RSA, the Debtors filed the DHCP Bankruptcy Petitions and the DHCP Chapter 11 Cases commenced thereby under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. Consistent with the DHCP RSA, on March 5, 2019, the Debtors filed the DHCP Plan with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to emerge from Chapter 11 on an expedited timeframe. The Debtors filed an amended DHCP Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on March 28, 2019. The Debtors are continuing to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company intends to continue to operate its businesses during the pendency of the DHCP Chapter 11 Cases, and the Debtors have obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court for a variety of first day motions seeking various relief, including relief authorizing them to maintain their operations in the ordinary course.
The filing of the DHCP Bankruptcy Petitions described above triggers an event of default or an early amortization event under certain of the Company's debt instruments, as described further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section under Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The filing of the DHCP Bankruptcy Petitions also triggers the liquidation preference of the Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Stock. Certain of our obligations, including the payment of interest under our debt instruments, are stayed under the Bankruptcy Code during the pendency of the DHCP Chapter 11 Cases.
During the pendency of the DHCP Chapter 11 Cases, the Bankruptcy Court granted relief enabling us to conduct our business activities in the ordinary course, including, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing us to pay employee wages and benefits, to pay taxes and certain governmental fees and charges, to continue to operate our cash management system in the ordinary course, and to pay the prepetition claims of certain of our vendors. For goods and services provided following the DHCP Petition Date, we continue to pay vendors under normal terms.
On March 5, 2019, the Debtors filed the Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Ditech Holding Corporation and its Affiliated Debtors (referred to herein as the DHCP Plan) and the related disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court. On March 28, 2019, the Debtors filed amendments to the DHCP Plan and the related disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy Court.
On the DHCP Effective Date, in accordance with the terms of the DHCP Plan, the Board of Directors of the reorganized Company is expected to consist of five directors. Four directors will be selected by the Requisite Term Lenders and one director will be the chief executive officer of the reorganized company, who shall be Thomas F. Marano.
Business Segments
We manage our Company in three reportable segments: Servicing; Originations; and Reverse Mortgage. At December 31, 2018, we serviced 1.5 million residential loans with an unpaid principal balance of $187.2 billion. We originated $12.6 billion in unpaid principal balance of mortgage loan volume in 2018. A description of the business conducted by each of these segments and our Corporate and Other non-reportable segment is provided below.
Servicing Segment
Our Servicing segment performs servicing for our own mortgage loan portfolio, on behalf of third-party credit owners of mortgage loans for a fee and on behalf of third-party owners of MSR for a fee, which we refer to as subservicing. The Servicing segment also operates complementary businesses including asset receivables management that performs collections of post charge-off deficiency balances for third parties and us. Commencing February 1, 2017, an insurance agency owned by the Company began to provide insurance marketing services to a third party with respect to voluntary insurance policies, including hazard insurance. In addition, the Servicing segment held the assets and mortgage-backed debt of the Residual Trusts until their deconsolidation in November 2018.

Our servicing and subservicing activities relating to our mortgage loan portfolio involve the management (e.g., calculation, collection and remittance) of mortgage payments, escrow accounts, insurance claims and customer service. For certain accounts, we perform specialty servicing activities utilizing a “high-touch” model to establish and maintain borrower contact and facilitate loss-mitigation strategies in an attempt to keep defaulted borrowers in their homes. Borrower interactions rely on loss mitigation strategies that apply predictive analytics to identify risk factors and severity grades to determine appropriate loss mitigation options and strategies. We assign a single point of contact to accounts experiencing difficulties in order to make collection calls and coordinate loss mitigation efforts. The single point of contact allows us to build one-on-one relationships with our consumers. We generally follow GSE and agency servicing guidelines (as well as other credit-owner guidelines) to implement a standardized loss mitigation process, which may include loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Our loan modification offerings include short-term interest rate reductions and/or payment deferrals and, until recently, also included loan modifications through HAMP, a federally sponsored loan modification program established to assist eligible home owners with loan modifications on their home mortgage debt. When loan modification and other efforts are unable to cure a default, we pursue alternative property resolutions prior to pursuing foreclosure, including short sales (in which the borrower agrees to sell the property for less than the loan balance and the difference is forgiven) and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure (in which the borrower agrees to convey the property deed outside of foreclosure proceedings).
With respect to mortgage loans for which we own the MSR, we perform mortgage servicing primarily in accordance with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae servicing guidelines, as applicable. In 2018, we earned approximately 32%, 12% and 3% of our total revenues from servicing Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac residential loans, respectively. Under our numerous master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts, we agree to service loans in accordance with servicing standards that the credit owners and/or subservicing clients may change from time to time. These agreements and contracts can typically be terminated by the counterparties thereto, with or without cause. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our master servicing agreements and subservicing contracts.
We have acquired servicing rights in bulk transactions, pursuant to co-issue arrangements and in connection with business acquisitions, and by retaining servicing rights relating to mortgage loans we originate. As the owner of servicing rights, we act on behalf of loan owners and have the contractual right to receive a stream of cash flows (expressed as a percentage of unpaid principal balance) in exchange for performing specified servicing functions and temporarily advancing funds to meet contractual payment requirements for loan owners and to pay taxes, insurance and foreclosure costs on delinquent or defaulted mortgages. As a subservicer, we earn a contractual fee on a per-loan basis and we are reimbursed for servicing advances we make on delinquent or defaulted mortgages, generally in the following month. We can earn incentive fees based on the performance of certain loan pools serviced by us and also have the ability, under certain circumstances, to earn modification fees and other program-specific incentives, and ancillary fees, such as late fees. Our specialty servicing fees typically include a base servicing fee and activity-based fees for the successful completion of default-related services.
The value of a servicing right asset is based on the present value of the stream of expected servicing-related cash flows from a loan and is largely dependent on market interest rates, prepayment speeds and delinquency performance. Generally, a rising interest rate environment drives a decline in prepayment speeds and thus increases the value of servicing rights, while a declining interest rate environment drives increases in prepayment speeds and thus reduces the value of servicing rights.
Our Servicing segment procured voluntary insurance for residential loan borrowers, lender-placed hazard insurance for residential loan borrowers and credit owners and other ancillary products through our principal insurance agency until the sale of such agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business on February 1, 2017. This agency earned commissions on insurance sales, and commissions were earned on lender-placed insurance in certain circumstances and if permitted under applicable laws and regulations. Mortgage loans require borrowers to maintain insurance coverage to protect the collateral securing the loan. To the extent a borrower fails to maintain the necessary coverage, we are generally contractually required to add the borrower’s property to our own hazard insurance policy and charge the borrower his/her allocated premium amount. Though we are licensed nationwide to sell insurance products on behalf of third-party insurance carriers, we neither underwrote insurance policies nor adjudicated claims.
Insurance revenues were historically aligned with the size of our servicing portfolio. However, due to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac restrictions that became effective on June 1, 2014, as well as other regulatory and litigation developments with respect to lender-placed insurance, our insurance commissions related to lender-placed insurance policies began to decrease materially beginning in 2014. On February 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our principal insurance agency and substantially all of our insurance agency business. As a result of this sale, we no longer receive any insurance commissions on lender-placed insurance policies. Commencing February 1, 2017, another insurance agency owned by us (and retained by us following the aforementioned sale) began to provide insurance marketing services to third-party insurance agencies and carriers with respect to voluntary insurance policies, including hazard insurance. This insurance agency receives premium-based commissions for its insurance marketing services.
10

Our Servicing segment performs collections of post charge-off or foreclosure deficiency balances for itself and on behalf of third-party securitization trusts and other asset owners. The third-party fee we earn is based on a percentage of our collections or a percentage of the unpaid principal balance. We recognize revenues associated with our on-balance sheet charged-off loan portfolio through its change in fair value.
Subservicing
As of December 31, 2018, our Servicing segment was the subservicer for approximately 0.7 million accounts with an unpaid principal loan balance of approximately $104.3 billion. These subserviced accounts represented approximately 61% of our total mortgage loan servicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance at that date. Our largest mortgage loan subservicing customer, NRM, represented approximately 78% of our total mortgage loan subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2018. Our next largest mortgage loan subservicing customer, Fannie Mae, represented approximately 17% of our total mortgage loan subservicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on December 31, 2018.
The subservicing contracts pursuant to which we are retained to subservice mortgage loans generally provide that our customer, the owner of the MSR that we subservice on behalf of, can terminate us as subservicer with or without cause, and each such contract has unique terms establishing the fees we will be paid for our work under the contract or upon the termination of the contract, if any, and the standards of performance we are required to meet in servicing the relevant mortgage loans, such that the profitability of our subservicing activity may vary among different contracts. We believe that our subservicing customers consider various factors from time to time in determining whether to retain or change subservicers, including the financial strength and servicer ratings of the subservicer, the subservicer's record of compliance with regulatory and contractual obligations (including any enhanced, "high touch" processes required by the contract) and the success of the subservicer in limiting the delinquency rate of the relevant portfolio. The termination of one or more of our subservicing contracts could have a material adverse effect on us, including on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain additional risks and uncertainties relating to our subservicing contracts. Refer also to the Transactions with NRM section below and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our transactions and relationship with NRM.
Originations Segment
Our Originations segment originates and purchases mortgage loans through the following channels:

• | consumer originations, which is comprised of:


◦ | consumer retention - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes leads generated through solicitations of consumers in our existing servicing portfolio and through referrals from our servicing call centers; and


◦ | consumer direct - originates mortgage loans primarily through the use of a centralized call center that utilizes origination leads generated through direct mail, internet, telephone and general advertising campaign solicitations of consumers, some of whom who are not currently in our existing servicing portfolio;


• | correspondent lending - purchases closed mortgage loans from a network of lenders in the marketplace; and


• | wholesale lending - originates mortgage loans through a network of approved brokers.

Our consumer originations operations offer a range of home purchase and refinance mortgage loan options, including fixed and adjustable rate conventional conforming, Ginnie Mae, FHA, VA, USDA and jumbo products. A conventional conforming loan is a mortgage loan that conforms to GSE guidelines, which include, but are not limited to, limits on loan amount, loan-to-value ratios, debt-to-income ratios, and minimum credit scores. The mortgage loans we fund are generally eligible for sale to GSEs or insured by government agencies.
We underwrite the mortgage loans we originate generally to secondary market standards, including the standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, the FHA, the USDA, the VA, and jumbo loan investor programs. Loans are reviewed by our underwriters in an attempt to ensure each mortgage loan is documented according to, and its terms comply with, the applicable secondary market standard. Our underwriters determine loan eligibility based on specific loan product requirements, such as loan-to-value, FICO, or maximum loan amount. Third-party diligence tools are utilized by our underwriters to validate data supplied by the potential borrower and to uncover potential discrepancies. We conduct audits on our underwriters to confirm proper adherence to our internal guidelines and polices, which audits are in addition to our standard quality control review. These audits are designed to provide an additional layer of internal review in an attempt to further mitigate quality defects and repurchase risk in the originations process.
11

Within our correspondent lending channel, we generally purchase the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. Correspondent lenders with which we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for selling loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we acquire through our correspondent lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of correspondent lenders, reviewing compliance by correspondent lenders with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of correspondent lenders on a periodic basis. In 2018, our correspondent lending channel purchased loans from 452 lenders in the marketplace, of which 38 were associated with approximately half of our purchases.
Within our wholesale lending channel, we originate loans through mortgage brokers. Loans sourced by mortgage brokers are underwritten and funded by us and generally close in our name. Through the wholesale channel, we generally originate the same types of loans that we originate in our consumer originations channel, although the mix varies among these channels. We underwrite and process all loan applications submitted by the mortgage brokers in a manner consistent with that described above for the consumer originations channel. Mortgage brokers with whom we do business agree to comply with our client guide, which sets forth the terms and conditions for brokering loans to us and generally governs the business relationship. We monitor and attempt to mitigate counterparty risk related to loans that we originate through our wholesale lending channel by conducting quality control reviews of mortgage brokers, reviewing compliance by brokers with applicable underwriting standards and our client guide, and evaluating the credit worthiness of brokers on a periodic basis.
Our capital markets group is responsible for pricing loans and managing the interest rate risk through the time a loan is sold to third parties and managing the risk (which we call the “pull-through risk”) that loans we have locked will not be closed and funded in an attempt to maximize loan sale profitability through our various originations channels. The capital markets group uses models and hedging analysis in an attempt to maximize profitability while minimizing the risks inherent in the originations business.
In 2018, the mix of mortgage loans sold by our Originations segment, based on unpaid principal balance, consisted of (i) 57% Ginnie Mae loans, (ii) 30% Fannie Mae conventional conforming loans and (iii) 13% Freddie Mac conventional conforming loans.
Our Originations segment revenue, which is primarily net gains on sales of loans, is impacted by interest rates and the volume of loans locked. The margins earned by our Originations segment are impacted by our cost to originate the loans including underwriting, fulfillment and lead costs. 
Reverse Mortgage Segment
Our Reverse Mortgage segment primarily focuses on the servicing of reverse loans. Effective January 2017, we exited the reverse mortgage originations business. We no longer have any reverse loans remaining in the originations pipeline and have finalized the shutdown of the reverse mortgage originations business. We continue to fund Tails, and, from time to time, securitize these amounts.
As a prior originator of reverse mortgages, this segment received cash proceeds at the time reverse loans were securitized and continues to receive cash proceeds at the time Tails are securitized. We securitized substantially all our reverse loans and continue to securitize Tails through the Ginnie Mae II MBS program into HMBS. Based upon the structure of the Ginnie Mae II MBS program, we determined that these securitizations do not meet all of the requirements for sale accounting, and as such, we account for these transfers as secured borrowings. Under this accounting treatment, the reverse loans remain on our consolidated balance sheets as residential loans. The segment earns net revenue on the net fair value gains on reverse loans and the related HMBS obligations.
This segment also performs subservicing for third-party credit owners of reverse loans, similar to our Servicing segment, and provides other complementary services for the reverse mortgage market, such as real estate owned property management and disposition, for a fee.
Corporate and Other Non-reportable Segment
Our Corporate and Other non-reportable segment includes our corporate functions and also holds the assets and liabilities of the Non-Residual Trusts and corporate debt. Effective January 1, 2018, we no longer allocate corporate overhead, including depreciation and amortization, to our operating segments. These amounts are now included in the Corporate and Other non-reportable segment. Prior year balances have been restated to conform to current year presentation. 
12

Competition 
We compete with a great number of institutions in the mortgage banking market for both the servicing and originations businesses as well as in our reverse mortgage servicing and complementary businesses. In the servicing area, we compete with other servicers to acquire MSR and for the right to subservice mortgages for others. Competitive factors in the servicing business include: a servicer’s scale of operations and financial strength; a servicer’s access to capital to fund acquisitions of MSR; a servicer’s ability to meet contractual and regulatory obligations and to achieve favorable performance (e.g., in default management activity) relative to other servicers; a servicer’s ability to provide a favorable experience for the borrower; a servicer's ability to recapture borrowers as they refinance; and a servicer’s cost to service or subservice. 
In the mortgage originations area, we compete to refinance or provide new mortgages to borrowers whose mortgages are in our existing servicing portfolio. In this area, the price and variety of our mortgage products are important factors of competition, as is the reputation of our servicing business and the quality of the experience the borrower may have had with our servicing business. Since mid-2015, our loan originations and servicing businesses have operated under a single “Ditech” brand. We also compete, principally on the basis of price and process efficiency, to acquire mortgages from correspondent lenders. In the future, we expect we will also increasingly compete on the basis of brand awareness.
Across our servicing and originations businesses, technology is an important competitive factor. In particular, we believe it will be increasingly important to enable servicing and originations customers to access our services through our website and mobile devices. We face numerous competitors with greater financial resources, human resources and technology resources than ours, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.
Technology
Our businesses employ technology by using third-party systems where standardization and time to market is key and proprietary systems where functionality and flexibility are critical to regulatory compliance, customer experience and credit performance. The majority of our proprietary systems are supported by a team of information technology professionals who seek to protect our systems and ensure they are effective. In-house developed proprietary systems are leveraged for customer service, default management and reverse mortgage servicing.
On October 27, 2014, we signed a long-term Loan Servicing Agreement with Black Knight Financial Services, LLC for the use of MSP, a mortgage and consumer loan servicing platform. We also use our own proprietary systems for collections, customer service and default management. At December 31, 2018, we have approximately 85% of our mortgage loan servicing portfolio based on unpaid principal loan balance on MSP. Our private label loans, manufactured housing loans and second lien mortgage loans continue to be serviced on our proprietary systems.
Subsidiaries
For a listing of our subsidiaries, refer to Exhibit 21 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
We have undergone several changes in our senior leadership during 2018, including the following: effective April 18, 2018, Thomas F. Marano was appointed Chief Executive Officer and President of Ditech Holding, and serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors; and effective February 9, 2018, Jerry Lombardo was appointed Ditech Holding's Chief Financial Officer. 
We employed approximately 2,900 full-time equivalent employees at December 31, 2018 as compared to approximately 3,800 at December 31, 2017, all of whom were located in the U.S. The decline in full-time equivalent employees was due primarily to distinct actions we took in 2018 in connection with our continued efforts to enhance efficiencies and streamline processes within the organization, which included various organizational changes to scale our leadership team and support functions to further align with our business needs. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees. However, we experience significant turnover with respect to certain roles, and therefore maintain active and continuous new employee recruiting and training programs. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
We outsource certain support functions that support our loan originations and servicing groups to third-party vendors located in the U.S. and offshore locations in an effort to improve efficiency and reduce cost. These support functions include loan set-up, escrow account set-up, default set-up, foreclosure monitoring, claims filing, post-close audits, indexing and imaging.

Transactions with NRM 
NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement
On August 8, 2016, our subsidiary, Ditech Financial, and NRM executed the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement whereby we agreed to sell to NRM all of our right, title and interest in mortgage servicing rights with respect to a pool of mortgage loans, with subservicing retained. The NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement provides that, from time to time, we may sell additional MSR to NRM in bulk or as originated or acquired on a flow basis, subject in each case to the parties agreeing on price and certain other terms.
On January 17, 2018, we agreed to sell to NRM MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $11.3 billion as of such sale date, with subservicing retained, and received approximately $90.4 million in cash proceeds from NRM as partial consideration for this MSR sale. We used 80% of such cash proceeds to repay borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement and used the remaining cash proceeds for general corporate purposes. During June 2018, under an agreement similar to the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement, we agreed to sell to New Penn Financial, which became an affiliate of NRM when acquired by NRM on July 3, 2018, MSR relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $4.7 billion as of the sale date, with servicing released, and received approximately $56.7 million in cash proceeds from NRM as partial consideration for the MSR sale. Since entering into the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and through December 31, 2018, in various bulk transactions under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and a similar agreement, we have sold MSR to NRM relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $75.8 billion as of the applicable closing dates of such transactions. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $397.1 million in cash proceeds relating to such sales, which proceeds do not include certain holdback amounts relating to such sales that are expected to be paid to us over time. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $34.5 million in cash proceeds relating to these holdback amounts and at December 31, 2018 and 2017 had a servicing rights holdback receivable, net from NRM of $10.8 million and $31.3 million, respectively, which is recorded in receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
We also transferred MSR to NRM under flow transactions relating to mortgage loans consisting entirely of co-issue loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.6 billion and $469.5 million for the period from February 10, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and the period from January 1, 2018 through February 9, 2018, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we transferred MSR to NRM under flow transactions relating to mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $7.6 billion, which included co-issue loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $6.4 billion. These transfers included recapture activities of generally non-NRM portfolio serviced loans with an aggregate unpaid balance of $1.6 billion and $236.9 million for the period from February 10, 2018 through December 31, 2018 and the period from January 1, 2018 through February 9, 2018, respectively. In addition, these transfers generated revenues of $44.1 million, $3.8 million and $61.8 million for the period from February 10, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the period from January 1, 2018 through February 9, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, which are recorded in net gains on sales of loans on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).
NRM Subservicing Agreement
On August 8, 2016, we entered into the NRM Subservicing Agreement whereby we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans whose MSR are sold to NRM under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement and for other mortgage loans as may be agreed upon by us and NRM from time to time, in exchange for a subservicing fee. Under the NRM Subservicing Agreement and a related agreement, we perform all daily servicing obligations on behalf of NRM, including collecting payments from borrowers and offering refinancing options to borrowers for purposes of minimizing portfolio runoff. On January 17, 2018, Ditech Financial and NRM executed a Side Letter Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, certain provisions of the NRM Subservicing Agreement were amended and/or waived. On June 28, 2018, Ditech Financial and NRM executed an additional Side Letter Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, NRM agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to add additional loans to the NRM Subservicing Agreement for us to subservice.
On January 17, 2019, we received a notice from NRM initiating the process of termination under the NRM Subservicing Agreement. Any termination of the NRM Subservicing Agreement would not be effective until a servicing transfer has been completed in accordance with applicable requirements. We are reviewing the grounds for termination in consultation with our stakeholders and are considering all of our options with respect thereto including legal rights and remedies. We are proceeding with our strategic alternative efforts assuming there is not an ongoing subservicing relationship with NRM. Our plans are not contingent on any continuing relationship with NRM.
14

We expect that it will take several months to complete the transfer of servicing on loans we subservice for NRM under the NRM Subservicing Agreement. The receipt of the notice of termination, in and of itself, is not an event of default or cross default under our debt documents or warehouse facilities. Subsequent to receiving the aforementioned notice from NRM, and at the direction of and in coordination with NRM, on March 16, 2019 and April 1, 2019, we completed the transfer of servicing on certain NRM subservicing portfolios containing, in aggregate, approximately 208,000 accounts. We are working with NRM to complete additional transfers of servicing on the remaining loans we subservice for NRM under the NRM Subservicing Agreement.
With respect to Ditech Financial, for mortgage loans that were being subserviced by Ditech Financial under the NRM Subservicing Agreement prior to January 17, 2018, and for any additional mortgage loans that Ditech Financial subserviced under the NRM Subservicing Agreement that were added to such agreement after such date (other than (i) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and (ii) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date), the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement expired on August 8, 2017 and was automatically renewed for a successive one-year term, and was further automatically renewed for a successive one-year term thereafter until the aforementioned notice of termination. 
With respect to Ditech Financial, for mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk MSR sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement was scheduled to expire on January 17, 2019 (with respect to the aforementioned bulk MSR sale) or, with respect to each flow MSR assignment agreement executed by the parties after such date in connection with any flow MSR sales by Ditech Financial to NRM after such date, the first anniversary of the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which such flow MSR assignment agreement was executed; however, such expiration dates were superseded by the aforementioned notice of termination, and the NRM Subservicing Agreement is expected to terminate upon completion of the servicing transfer.
With respect to NRM, for mortgage loans that were being subserviced by Ditech Financial under the NRM Subservicing Agreement prior to January 17, 2018, and for any additional mortgage loans that Ditech Financial subserviced under the NRM Subservicing Agreement that were added to such agreement after such date (other than (i) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and (ii) mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date), the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement expired on August 8, 2017 and thereafter the agreement would automatically terminate with respect to such mortgage loans, unless renewed by NRM on a monthly basis. Since the expiration of the initial term, NRM has renewed the NRM Subservicing Agreement each month thereafter until the aforementioned notice of termination received from NRM on January 17, 2019.
In the case of mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial in a bulk MSR sale agreed to by the parties on January 17, 2018 and mortgage loans relating to MSR sold to NRM by Ditech Financial on a flow basis under the NRM Flow and Bulk Agreement after such date, the initial term of the NRM Subservicing Agreement was scheduled to expire on January 17, 2019 (with respect to the aforementioned bulk MSR sale) or, with respect to each flow MSR assignment agreement executed by the parties after such date in connection with any of our flow MSR sales to NRM after such date, the first anniversary of the first day of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter during which such flow MSR assignment agreement was executed; however, such expiration dates were superseded by the aforementioned notice of termination, and the NRM Subservicing Agreement is expected to terminate upon completion of the servicing transfer.
Rights Agreement
We had previously adopted the Rights Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2015, and subsequently amended and restated on November 11, 2016 and further amended on November 9, 2017 and February 9, 2018, which provided that if any person or group of persons, excluding certain exempted persons, acquired 4.99% or more of the outstanding common stock of Walter Investment Management Corp. or any other interest that would be treated as “stock” for the purposes of Section 382, there would be a triggering event potentially resulting in significant dilution in the voting power and economic ownership of such acquiring person or group. The Rights Agreement was intended to help protect our “built-in tax losses” and certain other tax benefits by acting as a deterrent to any person or group of persons acting in concert from becoming or obtaining the right to become the beneficial owner (including through constructive ownership of securities owned by others) of 4.99% or more of the shares of our common stock. The Rights Agreement was scheduled to expire on November 11, 2018 or upon the earlier occurrence of certain events, subject to extension by the Board of Directors or exchange of rights by us.
On the WIMC Effective Date, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement with Computershare, which accelerated the scheduled expiration date of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement) to the WIMC Effective Date. The Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement, which were also canceled by operation of the WIMC Prepackaged Plan, have expired and are no longer outstanding, and the Rights Agreement has terminated.
15

In connection with the adoption of our Rights Agreement, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, setting forth the rights, powers, and preferences of our junior participating preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the rights. The cancellation of all existing equity interests by operation of the WIMC Prepackaged Plan included the cancellation of any rights issued under the Rights Agreement. In addition, on the WIMC Effective Date, we filed Articles of Amendment with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, which among other things, served to eliminate our junior participating preferred stock. 
Transfer Restrictions
Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, adopted on the WIMC Effective Date, include transfer restriction provisions intended to protect the tax benefits described above. Our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, adopted on the WIMC Effective Date, include certain restrictions on the transfer of our securities intended to preserve the value of our tax attributes, by minimizing the likelihood of an “ownership change” under applicable tax rules. Subject to certain exceptions, the Articles of Amendment and Restatement generally will restrict (i) any transfer that would result in a person or entity accumulating 4.75% or more of our common shares (assuming for the purpose of calculating the 4.75% that all outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock have fully converted) or 4.75% or more of the outstanding shares of our Convertible Preferred Stock (on a separate class basis), (ii) any transfer as to any person or entity that already owns shares at or above such 4.75% threshold, such person or entity acquiring additional stock of our securities and (iii) under limited circumstances described in the Articles of Amendment and Restatement, a transfer by a person or entity that owns shares at or above such 4.75% threshold from disposing of all or part of such stock.
The Articles of Amendment and Restatement exempt from the restrictions (i) any transfer approved in writing (prior to the date of the transfer) by the Board of Directors, (ii) a tender or exchange offer by us to purchase our securities, a purchase program effected by us on the open market or certain other redemptions of our securities, (iii) a conversion, pursuant to its terms, of Convertible Preferred Stock, and (iv) certain transfers by a person or entity that received as part of our WIMC Chapter 11 Case and owns 4.75% or more of our Convertible Preferred Stock. 
The procedure for approval of a transfer by the Board of Directors, as well as the other details and elements of these restrictions, are set forth in the Articles of Amendment and Restatement.
Laws and Regulations 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, VA, the SEC and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations of our mortgage servicing and mortgage originations businesses. We are also subject to a variety of regulatory and contractual obligations imposed by credit owners, investors, insurers and guarantors of the mortgages we originate and service, including, but not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, FHFA, USDA and the VA/FHA. Furthermore, our industry has been under scrutiny by federal and state regulators over the past several years, and we expect this scrutiny to continue. Laws, rules, regulations and practices that have been in place for many years may be changed, and new laws, rules, regulations and administrative guidance have been, and may continue to be, introduced in order to address real and perceived problems in our industry. We expect to incur ongoing operational, legal and system costs in order to comply with these rules and regulations.
Federal Law
We are required to comply with numerous federal consumer protection and other laws, including, but not limited to:

• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Regulation P, which require initial and periodic communications with consumers on privacy matters and the maintenance of privacy matters and the maintenance of privacy regarding certain consumer data in our possession;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which regulates the timing and content of communications on debt collections;


• | the TILA, including HOEPA, and Regulation Z, which regulate mortgage loan origination activities, require certain disclosures be made to mortgagors regarding terms of mortgage financing, regulate certain high-cost mortgages, mandate home ownership counseling for mortgage applicants and regulate certain mortgage servicing activities;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and Regulation V, which collectively regulate the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers;


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics in the extension of credit and require certain disclosures to applicants for credit;


• | the Homeowners Protection Act, which requires the cancellation of mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;

16


• | the HMDA and Regulation C, which require reporting of certain public loan data;


• | the Fair Housing Act and its implementing regulations, which prohibit discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics;


• | the Service Members Civil Relief Act, as amended, which provides certain legal protections and relief to members of the military;


• | the RESPA and Regulation X, which govern certain mortgage loan origination activities and practices and related disclosures and the actions of servicers related to various items, including escrow accounts, servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, loss mitigation, error resolution, and other customer communications;


• | Regulation AB under the Securities Act, which requires registration, reporting and disclosure for mortgage-backed securities;


• | certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which among other things, created the CFPB and prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;


• | the Federal Trade Commission Act, the FTC Credit Practices Rules and the FTC Telemarketing Sales Rule, which prohibit unfair and certain related practices;


• | the TCPA, which restricts telephone solicitations and automatic telephone equipment;


• | Regulation N, which prohibits certain unfair and deceptive acts and practices related to mortgage advertising;


• | the Bankruptcy Code and bankruptcy injunctions and stays, which can restrict collection of debts;


• | the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act; and


• | various federal flood insurance laws that require the lender and servicer to provide notice and ensure appropriate flood insurance is maintained when required.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, constituted a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, as well as the regulation of derivatives, capital market activities and consumer financial services. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage servicers and originators, including TILA, RESPA and the FDCPA. The CFPB also has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB's jurisdiction includes persons (such as us) originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans, those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans and certain entities involved in the transfer of MSR.
Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a number of requirements on mortgage originators and servicers of residential mortgage loans, significantly increased the penalties for noncompliance with certain consumer protection laws and also established new standards and practices for mortgage originators and servicers. Subsequent to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has issued, and is expected to continue to issue, various rules that impact mortgage servicing and originations, including: periodic billing statements; certain notices and acknowledgments; prompt crediting of borrowers’ accounts for payments received; additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers; prompt investigation of complaints by borrowers; additional requirements before purchasing insurance to protect the lender’s interest in the property; certain customer service benchmarks for servicers; servicers’ obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures; requirements to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; rules governing the scope, timing, content and format of disclosures to consumers regarding the interest rate adjustments of their variable-rate transactions; establishing certain requirements relating to billing statements, payment crediting and the provision of payoff statements; preventing or limiting servicers of residential mortgage loans from taking certain actions (e.g. the charging of certain fees); requirements for determining prospective borrowers’ abilities to repay their mortgages; removing incentives for higher cost mortgages; prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages; prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses; requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers; restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect; requiring new mortgage loan disclosures that integrate the TILA disclosures with the RESPA disclosures for certain covered transactions; and other new requirements, in each case either increasing costs and risks related to servicing and originations or reducing revenues currently generated.
State Law
We are also subject to extensive state licensing, statutory and regulatory requirements as a mortgage servicer, loan originator and debt collector throughout the U.S. We are subject to ongoing supervision, audits and examinations conducted by state regulators, including periodic requests from state and other agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and business practices.
17

State laws affecting our businesses have also been evolving. Some changes have occurred on a nationwide basis at the state level due to the establishment and/or amendment of minimum standards under federal law, such as state licensing requirements. Some states may seek to incorporate federal requirements as a requirement imposed on a state-licensed entity, while other states may seek to impose their own additional requirements to the extent not preempted under federal law. Additionally, there have been growing trends in state lawmaking focusing on the servicing of mortgage loans related to, for example, data privacy, loan modifications and anti-foreclosure measures.
Recent Regulatory Developments
Servicing Segment
There have been various legal and regulatory developments in Nevada regarding liens asserted by HOAs for unpaid assessments. In September 2014, the Nevada Supreme Court held that an HOA non-judicial foreclosure sale can extinguish a mortgage lender’s previously-recorded first deed of trust on a property if that foreclosure is to recover assessments categorized as super-priority amounts. In June 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada issued an opinion holding that federal law prohibits an HOA foreclosure proceeding from extinguishing a first deed of trust assigned to Fannie Mae. A Nevada state court subsequently reached the same conclusion. The Nevada Supreme Court also reversed a lower court summary judgment decision invalidating an HOA foreclosure sale on the basis that the HOA refused the lienholder’s tender of the super-priority portion of the lien and that the HOA sale was commercially unreasonable. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that these were issues of fact and remanded for further proceedings. Additional litigation in both state and federal courts and appellate courts is pending with respect to these issues. Case law is quickly developing, is not harmonious as between federal and state courts and varies by judge within each jurisdiction. Also, legislation in Nevada, which became effective on October 1, 2015, requires HOAs to provide notice to lienholders relating to the default and foreclosure sale and also to provide creditors with a right to redeem the property for up to 60 days following an HOA foreclosure sale. In January 2017, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that the state’s non-judicial HOA foreclosure statutes in effect prior to the 2015 amendments do not unconstitutionally violate due process and are not a government taking. This opinion conflicts with a 2016 decision of the Ninth Circuit, holding that the statute was unconstitutional. Credit owners may assert claims against servicers for failure to advance sufficient funds to cover unpaid HOA assessments and protect the credit owner’s interest in the subject property. We service numerous loans in Nevada and are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings affected by, or related to, these HOA matters.
Originations Segment
On April 26, 2018, the CFPB finalized an amendment to its “Know Before You Owe” mortgage disclosure rule that addresses when mortgage lenders with a valid justification may pass on increased closing costs to consumers and report them on a closing disclosure. The amendment was designed to provide greater clarity and certainty to the mortgage industry. It took effect June 1, 2018. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law by the President. Among its many provisions were those addressing the following topics:

• | Loan Officer Licensing - Amends the SAFE Act to temporarily allow loan originators that meet specified requirements to continue to originate loans after moving (1) from one state to another, or (2) from a depository institution to a non-depository institution. This provision is effective November 24, 2019.


• | No Wait for Lower Mortgage Rates - Amends the TILA requirement that a lender provide a borrower with a mortgage disclosure or a revised disclosure at least three business days prior to a mortgage closing. Eliminates the three-day waiting period in situations where a creditor extends to a borrower a second offer of credit that lowers the APR on the mortgage. Also encourages the CFPB to provide clearer guidance on the applicability of TRID to mortgage assumptions. This provision took effect June 23, 2018.


• | Restoration of the PTFA - Repeals the sunset provision of the PTFA and restores it as it was in effect prior to its expiration on December 30, 2014. The PTFA provided bona fide tenants residing in properties foreclosed with certain protections, including a 90-day notice before the tenant could be evicted. The PTFA also allowed bona fide tenants the right to remain in the property until the pre-foreclosure lease expired. This provision took effect June 23, 2018.


• | Veteran Home Loan Refinancing Reform - Adds protections for veterans who refinance their purchase or construction home loans. Under the Act, the VA will not guarantee or insure the refinancing of a loan to purchase or construct a home unless the insurer provides a certification of the recoupment period for expenses incurred by the borrower in refinancing the loan. Further, all costs and fees must be recouped within 36 months of the loan issuance, and the recoupment must occur through lower monthly payments due to the refinancing. Furthermore, the insurer must provide the veteran with a net tangible benefit test and abide by certain rules regarding the required minimum reduction in the interest rate on the refinanced loan. Per VA Circular 26-18-13, this provision was effective with applications taken on or after May 25, 2018.

18


• | Foreclosure Relief for Service Members - Makes permanent an amendment to the Service Members Civil Relief Act that allowed for a stay of foreclosure, sale or seizure proceedings for a service member for any action filed during or within one year of the Service Member’s period of service. This provision took effect June 23, 2018.

On February 12, 2019, federal regulatory agencies issued a joint final rule to implement provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, requiring regulated institutions to accept certain private flood insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies. The final rule includes a streamlined compliance aid provision to help evaluate whether a flood insurance policy meets the definition of “private flood insurance.” This compliance aid allows a regulated lending institution to conclude that a policy meets the definition of “private flood insurance” without further review of the policy if the policy, or an endorsement to the policy, states: “This policy meets the definition of private flood insurance contained in 42 U.S.C. 4012a(b)(7) and the corresponding regulation.” It is effective July 1, 2019.
Reverse Mortgage Segment
On January 19, 2017, HUD published the “Final HECM Rule, FHA: Strengthening the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.” The primary purpose of this rule was to codify into regulation prior guidance issued by HUD under mortgagee letters authorized by the Reverse Mortgage Stabilization Act of 2013 and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. This rule addresses a wide range of reverse mortgage origination and servicing issues, and in certain areas, amends prior guidance and rules. This rule became effective on September 19, 2017.
HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05, effective April 18, 2017, provided consolidated and updated guidance regarding the submission of HECM assignments to HUD. Since the publication of HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05, RMS has increasingly experienced delays and rejections with respect to HUD’s acceptance and payment of certain assignment claims, which, in turn, increases the amount of time RMS must carry the applicable loan's balance between the time the loan is bought out of a GNMA pool until the assignment claim is paid. The two predominant reasons for the increase in delays and rejections of HECM assignments relate to HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05 being interpreted to require proof that property taxes are "current," as opposed to the prior requirement of proof that such taxes were paid "timely," and the HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05 guidance that the only acceptable proof of hazard insurance is a copy of the borrower's current insurance "declarations page." 
HUD Mortgagee Letter 2018-08, effective October 22, 2018, provided revised and amended guidance regarding documentation requirements associated with the submission of HECM assignments to HUD and modified HUD Mortgagee Letter 2017-05 in several ways, including clarifying when property taxes are considered “current” and providing that HUD will now accept alternative written documentation evidencing hazard insurance coverage in lieu of a current hazard insurance declaration page. 
Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of certain risks relating to our HECM repurchase obligations and related matters.
