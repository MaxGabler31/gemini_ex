ITEM 1. BUSINESS



Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this document to “Cyren”, “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are to Cyren Ltd., and its consolidated subsidiaries, namely Cyren Inc., Cyren Iceland hf, Cyren UK Ltd., and Cyren Gesellschaft GmbH.



General



We were incorporated as a private company under the laws of the State of Israel on February 10, 1991 and our legal form is a company limited by shares. We became a public company on July 15, 1999 under the name Commtouch Software Ltd. In January 2014, we changed our legal name to Cyren Ltd.



Cyren was an early pioneer and is a provider of cloud delivered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cybersecurity solutions that protect businesses, their employees, and customers against threats from email, files, and the web.



Our security solutions are architected around the fundamental belief that cybersecurity is a race against time – and the cloud best enables the speed, sophistication and advanced automation needed to detect and block threats as they emerge on the internet around the globe. As more and more businesses move their data and applications to the cloud, they need a security provider that is able to keep pace.

Security threats are more prevalent and stealthier than ever. As cybercrime has become more sophisticated, every malware, phishing and ransomware variant is unique, making it more difficult to detect. While organizations have traditionally protected their users with security at their network perimeter, more frequent and evasive attacks combined with a more distributed and virtual workforce are reducing the effectiveness of this approach. Traditional approaches may lack the real-time threat intelligence and processing power to detect emerging threats, and the growth of mobile devices and an increasingly distributed workforce mean that more and more business is conducted outside of the traditional network perimeter. As a result, when new attacks appear in a matter of seconds, legacy cybersecurity products can leave companies vulnerable for hours, days or even weeks.

Cyren Enterprise Security Products



Cyren historically provided SMB and enterprise customers a set of internet security services from a common integrated platform called Cyren Cloud Security (CCS). CCS applications included Cyren Web Security (a SaaS secure web gateway), Cyren Email Security (a SaaS secure email gateway), Cyren DNS Security (a SaaS DNS web filtering solution), and Cyren Cloud Sandboxing (an advanced threat protection service integrated into Cyren Web Security and Cyren Email Security, and also available as a standalone service).



During 2019, Cyren revised its enterprise product strategy to focus on email security solutions, threat detection services and threat intelligence data products.



Cyren’s current Enterprise Security products include:



Cyren Email Security (CES) – a cloud-based secure email gateway that works well with both on premise and cloud-based business email, Cyren Email Security filters an organization’s inbound and outbound email to protect users from security threats and spam. Inbound email security protects against malware, phishing, business email compromise, and more, with advanced threat protection from cloud sandboxing, malware outbreak protection and time-of-click analysis. Support for SPF (Sender Policy Framework) provides sender validation to prevent email spoofing, while policy-based encryption protects sensitive email communications. Outbound protections block botnet-infected devices from sending malware or spam from a customer’s domain.



Cyren Inbox Security (CIS) – Cyren developed an anti-phishing solution targeted at enterprise customers using the Microsoft 365 email platform that was launched in the second quarter of 2020.

Intellectual Property



We regard our patented and patent pending anti-spam and antivirus technology, copyrights, service marks, trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and rely on patent, trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights.



In 2004, we purchased a United States patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,330,590 that relates to the Recurrent Pattern Detection (RPD) technology used in many of our security solutions. During 2006, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to the prevention of spam in streaming systems or, in other words, unwanted conversational media sessions (i.e., voice and video related). This provisional application was converted to a full patent application and that application was then divided into three applications. The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the original application as United States Patent No. 7,849,186. The three divisional patents were also subsequently granted as United States Patent No. 7,991,919, United States Patent No. 8,190,737, and United States Patent No. 8,195,795, all of which have a term concurrent with US Patent No. 7,849,186. In 2016, we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to a multi-sandbox array that utilizes unique intellectual property we developed in support of our cyber threat protection capabilities. In February 2017, we converted this provisional application into full patent applications for the multi-sandbox array in the United States, Europe, and Israel. The resulting US patent No. 10,482,243 was granted in November 2019, Israel patent 250797 was granted in July 2020, and European patent EP3211558 was granted in September 2021. In July 2018 we filed a provisional patent application in the United States relating to phishing detection systems and methods we developed in support of our anti-phishing capabilities. In July 2019, we converted this provisional application into full patent applications for phishing detection in the United States, Europe, and Israel. In September 2021, we filed a continuation patent application in the United States covering our phishing protection solutions for mobile devices. In 2019 U.S. Patent No. 6,330,590 expired after completion of its full 20-year term. We may seek to patent certain additional software or other technology in the future.



We have registered trademarks for our company name “Cyren” in the US and Europe and we are also maintaining our registered trademark for “Commtouch” in the U.S. Through acquisition, we also acquired registered trademarks such as “FRISK”, “F-PROT”, “eleven”, “Expurgate” and “Command Anti-malware”. We may allow certain of these trademarks to lapse over time. Since at least September 2003, we have claimed common law trademark rights in “RPD” and “Recurrent Pattern Detection”, as applicable to our messaging security solutions. We have also been claiming common law trademark rights in “Zero-Hour” in relation to our virus outbreak detection product (and more recently one of our web security products) and “GlobalView” in relation to our Internet Protocol, or IP, reputation and web security products, as well as our “cloud computing” network infrastructure.



It may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States, Europe or elsewhere will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology.



Other parties may assert infringement claims against us. We may also be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us and/or our customers of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Our customer agreements typically include indemnity provisions so we may be obligated to defend against third party intellectual property rights infringement claims on behalf of our customers. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.



Government Programs



Under the R&D Law, research and development programs approved by the Research Committee (the “Research Committee”) of the Israeli Innovation Authority (the “IIA”) are eligible for “Benefits” which include grants, loans, exemptions, discounts, guarantees and additional means of assistance, but with the exclusion of purchase of shares, provided under various tracks promulgated by the Council Body (the “Tracks”). Most Tracks require the repayment of the Benefits in the form of the payment of royalties from the sale of the product developed in accordance with the published Track guidelines and subject to other restrictions. Once a project is approved, the IIA awards grants of up to 50% of the project’s expenditures in return for royalties, usually at the rate of 3% of sales of products developed with such grants. For projects approved after January 1, 1999, the amount of royalties payable was up to a dollar-linked amount equal to 100% of such grants plus interest at LIBOR. The total amount of grants received as of December 31, 2021 (none received since 2018) is approximately $6.4. Our total commitment for royalties payable with respect to future sales, based on IIA participations received, net of royalties paid or accrued, is approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2021.





7







The terms of these grants prohibit the manufacturing outside of Israel of the product developed in accordance with the program without the prior consent of the Research Committee. Such approval is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the IIA to between 120% and 300% of the amount granted, depending on the extent of the manufacturing that is conducted outside of Israel.



The R&D Law, also provides that know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee. The R&D Law stresses that it is not just transfer of know-how that was prohibited, but also transfer of any rights in such know-how. Approval of the transfer and/or license could be granted only if the Israeli transferee undertook to abide by all of the provisions of the R&D Law and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the restrictions on the transfer of know-how and the obligation to pay royalties, if applicable.



The know-how from the research and development and any derivatives thereof, cannot be transferred or licensed to non-Israeli third parties without the approval of the Research Committee, which approval is generally contingent on payment of a significant penalty of up to six times the grant amount plus LIBOR and minus any royalties paid. Such restriction does not apply to exports from Israel of final products developed with such technologies. On May 7, 2017, the IIA published the Rules for Granting Authorization for Use of Know-How Outside of Israel (the “Licensing Rules”). The Licensing Rules enable the approval of out-licensing arrangements and other arrangements for granting of an authorization to an entity outside of Israel to use know-how developed under research and development programs funded by the IIA and any derivatives thereof. Subject to payment of a “License Fee” to the IIA, at a rate that will be determined by the IIA in accordance with the Licensing Rules, the IIA may now approve arrangements for the license of know-how outside of Israel. This allows companies that have received IIA support to commercialize know-how in a manner which was not previously available.



Government Regulation



Laws aimed at curtailing the spread of spam have been adopted by the United States federal government, i.e., the CAN-SPAM Act, and certain individual U.S. states, with the CAN-SPAM Act superseding some state laws or certain elements thereof. The Israel government has also adopted an amendment to the Communications Law, 1982, aimed at curtailing the spread of spam transmittal of commercial advertisements by email, fax, SMS, or automated dialing systems without the consent of the recipient. Such laws may impact our marketing activities. The law sets punitive fines for advertisers of spam, who may also be subject to civil lawsuits and class actions.



The propagation of email viruses, whether through email or websites, which are aimed at destroying or stealing third party data, is illegal under standard state and federal law outlawing theft, misappropriation, conversion, etc., without the need for special legislation prohibiting such activities on the internet. Despite the existence of these laws, sources for internet viruses continue to spread multi-variant viruses seemingly without much fear of recrimination. New laws providing for more stringent penalties could be adopted in various jurisdictions, but it is unclear what, if any, affect these would have on the antivirus industry in general and our solutions in particular.



The EU enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect on May 25, 2018 and carries with it significantly increased responsibilities and potential penalties for companies that process EU personal data. In connection with GDPR, we expect increased regulatory and customer attention surrounding data privacy in the EU. In connection with GDPR, we experience increased customer attention surrounding data privacy in the EU. In February 2016, the U.S. and E.U. announced an agreement on framework for transatlantic data flows entitled the EU-US Privacy Shield (“Privacy Shield”) which we had previously relied in part as a mechanism to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. However, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice (the “CJEU”) invalidated the Privacy Shield (which took effect immediately). In addition, the CJEU made clear that while it upheld the adequacy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) issued by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to data processors established outside of the EU, reliance on SCCs alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and that their use must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The Company is currently evaluating what additional mechanisms may be required to establish adequate safeguards for the further transfer of personal data, in addition to the SCC. If we are unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing personal data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services. Furthermore, outside of the EU, we continue to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent state privacy laws, national laws regulating the collection and use of data, and security and data breach obligations. We have invested heavily in data sovereignty features to ensure that Cyren customer data is handled in accordance with applicable law.



We will continue to monitor legal requirements and will follow additional legal requirements for customer data privacy as they evolve.

Segments



We conduct our business on the basis of one reportable segment.



Research and Development



We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our products and services, build new products and improve our core technology. We invest heavily in our cloud infrastructure and new product offerings such as Cyren Inbox Security. Our engineering team has deep security expertise and works closely with customers to identify their current and future needs. In addition to our focus on hardware and software, our research and development team is focused on research into next-generation threats, which is required to respond to the rapidly changing threat landscape. We plan to continue to invest in resources to conduct our research and development effort.
Customers



As of December 31, 2021, we had customers of all sizes across a wide variety of industries. During the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer accounted for approximately 19% of total revenue. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the same customer accounted for approximately 23% of total revenue.
Competitive Landscape



The markets in which Cyren competes are intensely competitive and rapidly changing.



The principal competitive factors in our industry include price, product functionality, product integration, platform coverage and ability to scale, worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, and other resources than we do, as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base. Additionally, some of these competitors have more significant research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines and services we market and distribute, possibly at a lower cost. Our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces, to develop more advanced products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors and/or to purchase new products by way of strategic acquisitions, and to educate potential OEM customers as to the benefits of using our products rather than developing their own products.



In the market for email security solutions, there are sophisticated offerings that compete with our solutions. Email security providers offering forms of Software-as-a-Service email gateways, multi-functional appliances, and managed service solutions and which may be viewed as both competitors and potential customers to Cyren include Google, Symantec, McAfee, Cisco, Proofpoint, and Mimecast. Email security providers offering solutions on an OEM basis similar to Cyren’s business model, and which may be viewed as direct competitors, include Proofpoint (via the Cloudmark acquisition), Sophos, Mailshell and Vade Secure.



The market for real-time virus protection products is also constantly evolving, as those designing and proliferating viruses and other malware seek new vulnerabilities and distribution techniques, and also continue to leverage email distribution as a cost-effective medium for accurately targeting broad, numerous potential victims. Cyren’s real-time offering differs from traditional antivirus solutions by leveraging our global footprint and detection technology to rapidly detect outbreaks, often hours or days before traditional anti-malware solutions; it thereby offers a complementary solution to signature and heuristic-based antivirus engines. For this reason, our virus outbreak detection engine has been deployed by many security companies and service providers.





9







In the market for anti-malware solutions, there are vendors offering reasonably effective solutions using various technologies based on signatures, emulation, and heuristics. Cyren has a targeted OEM/service provider focus, plus an increasing focus on heuristics and zero-day effectiveness. Most companies in this space provide endpoint products and, in some cases, make software development kits available on an OEM basis. Competitors to Cyren include Sophos, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee, Symantec, and open source software such as Clam-AV (now part of Cisco).



In the market for anti-phishing solutions targeted at enterprise customers, Gartner has defined a category for providers of cloud delivered supplementary email security solutions such as Cyren Inbox Security(1). Although this is an early stage market, Gartner has identified several competitors to Cyren such as, Avanan, GreatHorn, Inky, Ironscales and Vade Secure.



We expect that the markets for internet security solutions will continue to become more consolidated, with companies increasing their presence in this market or entering ancillary markets by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners. See also disclosure under “Risk Factors—Business Risks— we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”



Threat Landscape



The last several years have possibly experienced the greatest amount of dramatic global incidents directly related to malware and cyber threats since the advent of the internet. From election hacks to global ransomware attacks, malware threats are at an all-time high. As long as these activities prove lucrative, we expect these incidents to get worse.



In this “cyber-war”, with respect specifically to malware, three battlefronts stand out: ransomware, hyper-evasive malware, and malware distribution via HTTPS.



Ransomware has become especially lucrative for cybercriminals. Massive scale ransomware attacks have spread extremely quickly around the globe targeting governments, corporations, and private citizens. With hyper-evasive malware, cybercriminals are using codes designed to specifically detect and evade conventional sandbox detection and analysis.



It has become clear that cybercriminals know the weak points in standard corporate defenses and are optimizing their attacks to leverage these security gaps in every possible way.



Today, no item or user connected to the internet is immune to attack. While many businesses are still studying what security measures might be necessary, cybercriminals are “all in”, creating dangerous new tools to target companies, governments, and private citizens. We need to be mindful that the world has changed, hyper-evasive malware and threat distribution via HTTPS are growing rapidly; mobile devices— both Android and Apple—are increasingly targets.

Cloud and Mobility



Businesses are going through a massive change in their IT strategies as they look to drive more business value, agility, and better customer experiences.




● | Business internet traffic continues to increase every year – executives, employees, partners, contractors, and customers are accustomed to transacting online. As a result, individuals are far more comfortable opening emails, clicking on links and providing sensitive data and information without questioning the authenticity of the applicable request. The simple organic growth in this usage of the internet is taxing existing legacy appliance solutions that have built-in capacity restrictions limiting their ability to scale.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data and applications are increasingly moving to the cloud – where we used to protect the servers, data and applications we ran in our data centers behind an appliance-based security perimeter, today these apps and data have moved outside of this security perimeter and into the cloud.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | More and more users are working remotely — users have left the perimeter, and are working from home offices, airports, hotels, and coffee shops, accessing the internet without protection from our perimeter security appliances.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As organizations go through this transition, many are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their users, data, and networks with traditional on-premise security solutions.




● | Buyers continue to move away from traditional on-premise solutions — preference for service-based security solutions are growing, driven by innovations, increasing need for security beyond the perimeter, and lower total cost of ownership.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mature and legacy on premise deployments are reaching end of life — and these are increasingly being replaced by SaaS alternatives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IT security staffing shortages – driving products with lower management overhead, as well as some outsourcing to key technology partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasingly fast, sophisticated, expensive, and high-profile attacks target organizations of all sizes – attacks are increasingly focused on small companies, less-regulated and less-security aware industries, dictating increased security investment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance and regulatory mandates are creating increased concern among buyers, especially as the cost of failure becomes more painful. Continued, large-scale breaches — themselves a driver for security purchases — will bring about even more stringent levels of regulation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Heightened cybercrime activity among commercial enterprises and nation states – political and economic motivations are driving cyberattacks of both private enterprises and government entities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automation is increasingly considered critical to accelerating detection and protection, and to countering IT talent shortages.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These reasons explain why Cyren’s vision for 100% cloud security is compelling to IT security teams looking to protect their businesses in today’s cloud-centric mobile-first world.
