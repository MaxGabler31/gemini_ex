Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, Basanite Industries, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BI”), we manufacture a range of “green” (environmentally friendly), sustainable, non-corrosive, lightweight, composite products used in concrete reinforcement by the construction industry. Our core product is BasaFlex™, a basalt fiber reinforced polymer (“BFRP”) reinforcing bar (known as “rebar”) which we believe is a stronger, lighter, sustainable, non-conductive, and corrosion-proof alternative to traditional steel.
 
Our two other main product lines are BasaMix™, which are fine denier basalt fibers available in various chopped sizes, and BasaMesh™, a line of Basalt Geogrid Mesh Rolls, intended to replace welded wire mesh (made of steel).
 
While we believe our products have significant market potential and have begun to gain some acceptance in the market (as evidenced by the beginning of revenue growth which occurred in 2021 as below under “Management’s Analysis and Discussion of Results of Operations”), we are currently conducting relatively limited operations due to lack of adequate funding. We are working to secure additional funding to increase our manufacturing capacity to meet what we believe will be increasing demand for our products, but until such funding is obtained, there will remain substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.
 
We were formed as a Nevada corporation in 2006 under the name “Nevada Processing Solutions, Inc.” and entered our current BFRP business in 2017.
 
Our Products
 
BFRP is a UV-stable, chemical, acid and moisture resistant material is sustainable and environmentally friendly and has been engineered to replace steel as it never rusts, therefore, addressing the industry’s current corrosion issues. BasaFlexTM BFRP rebar is a corrosion proof, chemical, acid and moisture resistant material, as well as being sustainable and environmentally friendly. BasaFlexTM, unlike alternative fiber reinforced polymer (“FRP”) products, was designed and engineered to replace steel in certain structures and applications. Since it is rustproof, BasaFlexTM directly addresses the construction industry’s current issues with reduced structure lifecycles due to corrosion.
 
Each of our products is specifically designed to extend the lifecycle of concrete products by eliminating “concrete spalling.” Spalling results from the steel reinforcing materials embedded within the concrete member rusting (contrary to popular belief, concrete is porous, and water can permeate into concrete). Rusting leads to the steel expanding and eventually causing the surrounding concrete to delaminate, crack, or even break off, resulting in potential structural failure. We believe that each of our products addresses this important need, along with other key requirements in today’s construction market, and that the following attributes of BasaFlex™ provide it with competitive advantages in the marketplace:
 

· | BasaFlex™ never corrodes: steel reinforcement products rust, leading to spalling and significant repair costs down the road;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | BasaFlex™ is sustainable: BasaFlex™ is made from Basalt rock, the most abundant rock found on Earth’s surface, and offers a longer product lifecycle than traditional steel (the lack of corrosion allows the life span of concrete products reinforced with BasaFlex to be significantly longer);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | BasaFlex™ is “green”: From mining, through production, to installation at the building site, BasaFlex™ has an exceptionally low carbon footprint when compared with that of steel; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | BasaFlex™ has a lower in-place cost: the physical nature of our products relative to steel result in a lower net cost to the contractor once installed, such as: BasaFlex™ is one-quarter of the weight of equivalent sized steel, meaning 4 times the quantity of material can be delivered by the same truck (or container); all Basanite products can be loaded/unloaded and moved around the jobsite by hand – no expensive handling equipment is needed; less concrete is required as BasaFlex™ does not require the extra concrete cover needed when using steel; and Basanite products are safer and easier to use. We believe all these factors materially reduce the net in-place cost of concrete reinforcement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
BasaMix™ is designed to help absorb the stresses associated with early-aged plastic shrinkage and settlement cracking in concrete, as well as providing an increased toughness for enhanced reinforcement in Slab on Grade (SOG) and precast elements. BasaMix™ also serves in a “system approach” for optimum performance of a concrete element when used in conjunction with our BasaFlex™ rebar.
 
BasaMesh™ is designed for secondary and temperature shrinkage reinforcement. BasaMesh™ can also work in conjunction with the BasaFlex™ rebar or BasaMix™ for a total reinforcement program.
 
We believe that macroeconomic factors are pressuring the construction industry to consider the use of alternative reinforcement materials for the following reasons:
 

· | the increasing need for global infrastructure repair; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | recent design trends towards increasing the lifespan of projects and materials; 
· | the global interest in promoting the use of sustainable products; and 
· | increasing consideration of both the long-term costs and environmental impacts of material selections.

 
We believe we are well positioned to benefit from this renewed focus, particularly in light of the interest of the U.S. government in funding infrastructure improvements (notably the passage of the $1.2 billion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in November 2021) and events such as the tragic collapse of a residential building in Surfside, Florida.
 
We submitted our first round of BasaFlex™ rebar products to the Structures and Materials Department of the University of Miami, an industry accredited independent testing laboratory, to obtain a Certified Test Report which allows us to participate in approved FRP applications, such as precast, architectural, flatwork and other non-structural engineered applications, or in applications where steel is a poor choice, like bridge decks, piers, seawalls, sewage tunneling and nuclear plants. On May 29, 2020, a Certified Test Report was submitted to us for engineering use.
 
During the third quarter of 2020, we began initial manufacturing operations and commenced the manufacture of our initial stock of inventory of BasaFlex™. Also, during this timeframe, we filled key manufacturing positions within our production facility and reached our primary goal of scaling to full capacity single shift operations. Management also began recruiting other key positions, focused initially on product development, driving sales growth and expanding our market presence. Our hiring was focused on key areas of excellence, specifically quality assurance; operations and other technical resources; engineering; and sales and marketing. We successfully completed our initial hiring plan and recruited key personnel with over 140 combined years of industry experience (although presently we have fewer personnel). We have begun selling across our complete product line and are currently working on securing larger orders. We have also sought to develop strategic commercial relationships with multiple testing programs underway (including international locations) across a broad range of applications.
 
During both the third and fourth quarters of 2020, BI continued research, and development work on BasaFlex™, with the goal of increasing its performance results in the category of modulus. While the baseline version easily met the required industry standard for FRP rebar, we have expanded goals for BasaFlex™ to be able to replace steel rebar in a broader range of applications than the current industry standard allows for. After extensive internal development and testing, a complete test set of bar sizes #3-#8 of an enhanced version of BasaFlex™ was submitted to the University of Sherbrooke (near Montreal, Canada) for lab testing. Sherbrooke, led by renowned materials scientist Dr. Brahim Benmokrane, is the world recognized leader in testing FRP products for concrete reinforcement. In February of 2021, Basanite obtained very promising results on the upgraded BasaFlex™ from the Sherbrooke lab, including best in class performance results in both tensile and modulus strength. Following on from this success, we have been working with multiple customers and design professionals to select BasaFlex™ as an alternative to steel in a broader range of applications. These efforts have more recently included work with CPPB and USS (each as defined below) and our board members Manuel A. Rodriguez and Frederick H. Tingberg, Jr.(who joined our Board of Directors in December 2021 as described below), all of whom have introduced us to their contacts within the construction industry and have worked to promote our products.

Early in 2021, we contracted with an independent software company to develop BasaPro™, a design software specifically for use with BasaFlex™. This development effort has been completed and the software is operational. BasaPro allows both our engineers and engineers of record (EOR) to easily compare engineering designs with steel and the same designs with the recommended use of BasaFlex™ in typical concrete applications. It allows for both the conversion to BasaFlex™ from steel in existing concrete designs and for original designs using BasaFlex™ and is based upon the application of industry standards ACI 440 (Guide for the Design and Construction of Structural Concrete Reinforced with Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Bars) and ACI 318 (Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete) using structural steel. BasaPro’s software outputs include all the calculations using independent test results and pictorial design work in conjunction with applicable building codes. This means we can now communicate with the design community in their own language.
 
On December 10, 2021, we entered into a strategic commercial relationship, comprised of two principal five year agreements: an Exclusive Supplier Agreement (the “Supplier Agreement”) with Concrete Products of the Palm Beaches, Inc. (“CPPB”), and a Distribution Agreement with U.S. Supplies, Inc. (“USS”). Based in Riviera Beach, Florida, CPPB is a custom precast manufacturer of concrete products for the construction industry, made from a combination of cement and aggregate raw materials. Based in West Palm Beach, Florida, USS is a domestic and international distributor of building products and supplies, specialty construction products, and a provider of engineering services. CPPB and USS are related parties via the common control of Manuel A. Rodriguez (who is a member of our Board of Directors). These contracts are described further below.
 
In connection with the transactions associated with the Supplier Agreement and the Distribution Agreement, we have issued to USS a common stock purchase warrant (the “Strategic Partner Warrant”). The Strategic Partner Warrant affords USS and its assigns the right, for a five (5) year term, to purchase up to forty million (40,000,000) shares of our common stock (the “Warrant Shares”) at an exercise price of $0.33 per Warrant Share. The right to purchase fifty percent (50%) (or 20,000,000) of the Warrant Shares shall vest immediately and the right to purchase the remaining fifty percent (50%) (or 20,000,000) of the Warrant Shares shall only vest upon our actual receipt of new investment into our company of not less than $5,000,000 from one or any combination of the following entities or individuals: (i) USS and its affiliates, (ii) CR Business Consultants, Inc. (any entity controlled by Raphael Salas) and its affiliates or (iii) any person or entity first introduced to us by any of the foregoing. As of the date of the Annual Report, this investment condition has not been achieved.
 
In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Distributor Agreement and the Supplier Agreement, our Board of Directors appointed Manuel A. Rodriguez and Frederick H. Tingberg, Jr. as members of our Board of Directors. Mr. Rodriguez is an affiliate of and controls each of USS and CPPB, and Mr. Tingberg (who provides consulting services within the construction industry) was recommended for appointment to our Board of Directors by Mr. Rodriguez.
 
Recent Developments
 
In the first quarter of 2022, we announced two material achievements related to market acceptance of, and potential orders for, our products:
 
In January 2022, we announced that our BasaFlex™ and BasaMesh™ reinforcement products were approved by the City of Pompano Beach, Florida for use in the city's subterranean stormwater and wastewater projects. The approval and related contract are for the use of our products in an initial project named the Lyons Park Stormwater and Wastewater Improvements Project. The approval called for a thorough technical review by the engineer of record for the Lyons Park project. Our products were vetted after an extensive submission of sealed calculations, documents and testing, following which the products were approved for use in subterranean stormwater and wastewater projects in the city in general and specified for use at Lyons Park.
In March 2022, our BasaFlex™ and BasaMesh™ reinforcement products were approved to replace steel reinforcement in existing Broward County infrastructure projects. The first Broward County project to utilize BasaFlex™ and BasaMesh™ is a community development called "UAZ 123," located in the city of Oakland Park, Florida.

Industry Background and Current and Proposed Customers
 
We are focused on the construction industry, more specifically on introducing composite products for the reinforcement of concrete and secondarily for asphalt. According to Grandview Research, the annual concrete reinforcement market in the U.S. is estimated to be approximately $9.4 billion. This market is very established and resistant to change; however the reinforcement of concrete using traditional steel products and methods have proven to be problematic. Almost every concrete building and foundation in the world was originally built using steel reinforcement. Steel is a long-time proven product for these applications, but it has an inherent problem: it corrodes (rusts) and degrades when exposed to air and water. Every steel reinforcing bar (or rebar) ever used is in some form of degradation due to corrosion. This corrosion leads the concrete to de-bond from the reinforcement, crack, and ultimately fail: the process is called “spalling.” This corrosion problem has been recognized by the governing bodies to the point that they have written into code a definition of the “acceptable” amount of corrosion on steel rebar prior to its use. Regardless, the bar continues to rust and ultimately this leads to costly maintenance, initially with repairs and eventually replacement over the lifetime of the structure. Addressing this problem is our key focus and value proposition – all of our products are essentially corrosion proof. In addition, we believe our disruptive alternative to steel reinforcement also offers greater strengths, giving the end-user alternatives for concrete reinforcing elements that will never require maintenance or replacement for as much as 100 years or more.
 
Our customer base is a mix between the design-build community and government agencies who can specify our products, and wholesalers (distributors), contractors and concrete producers who will use, and sell our products.
 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”)
 
The IIJA, signed into law on November 15, 2021, provides for significant national investments in the repair and rebuilding of roads and bridges in the U.S. with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety In the United States, 1 in 5 miles of highways and major roads, and 45,000 bridges, are in poor condition. The IIJA reauthorizes surface transportation programs for five years and invests $110 billion in additional funding to repair roads and bridges and support major projects. We believe that our environmentally friendly basalt fiber products are well positioned to emerge as a technology leader in the expanded market for intelligent construction materials that will benefit from the IIJA.  We are working on identifying opportunities to access federal funding streams this unprecedented U.S. federal investment in public safety, homeland security, and transportation infrastructure.
 
Suppler Agreement with CPPB
 
In December 2021, we entered into the Supplier Agreement with CPPB, who as a result became a significant customer. Under the terms of the Supplier Agreement, until December 31, 2022, we will sell products to CPPB at an agreed upon discounted price to the price of steel reinforcing bar (such price for steel rebar being first obtained by CPPB via a competitive third-party quote). We have agreed to this special pricing to afford CPPB the opportunity, for a one-year period, to incorporate our BFRP products into CPPB’s concrete products, and to offer these combined (and we believe improved) products to construction projects at prices competitive to prevailing steel reinforcing bar. We believe this collaborative approach with CPPB will result in both an acceleration of the process to gain regulatory and other required approvals by applicable third parties (including government agencies) for inclusion in construction projects, as well as an acceleration of market recognition of our products. Commencing January 1, 2023, we will sell our products to CPPB in accordance with an agreed upon fee schedule based upon our prevailing prices for the products. Such pricing may be amended from time to time with the mutual prior consent of the parties.
 
Under the terms of the Supplier Agreement, we are responsible for the engineering conversion calculations required to modify CPPB’s product designs from using steel rebar to using BasaFlexTM BFRP reinforcement. This will be accomplished through the use of our BasaProTM proprietary software, with a required review by a Florida licensed professional engineer. CPPB is responsible, among other matters, for taking all necessary steps to obtain product clearance, validation, importation authorization and any product approvals, regulatory licenses, or other approvals, permits or material authorizations as may be required by any governmental agency or authority with respect to the importation, marketing, distribution, sale and use of its concrete products incorporating our products. We believe that the combined efforts of our company and CPPB will also accelerate the qualification of our products for government and other contracts and help gain the acceptance of our products for these contracts.

The Supplier Agreement also contains other customary terms and conditions, including with respect to the making of product orders, packaging and delivery, product warranties, product returns, intellectual property, confidentiality, limitations on liability, indemnification, non-solicitation of employees, insurance and representations and warranties of the parties.
 
The Supplier Agreement has a term of five (5) years, and thereafter the term shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless terminated by the parties prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term. The Supplier Agreement may be terminated (i) by the mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) upon breach of the Supplier Agreement (with a notice period and an opportunity to cure) and (iii) upon the bankruptcy and insolvency of a party.
 
While we have generated relatively little revenue to date, we continue to receive inquiries from a range of customers for our products, indicating what we believe is a significant level of market interest for BasaFlex™. Some of these inquiries would be for very large potential orders for new, multi-year construction projects. Based on our current manufacturing capacity, these inquiries (if they lead to actual orders) would exceed our capability to deliver within the customer’s requested timeframe, and largely because of this, there is no guarantee that orders will actually be received without expansion.
 
Manufacturing
 
We lease a fully permitted, 36,900 square foot facility located in Pompano Beach, Florida equipped with five customized, Underwriters Laboratories approved, Pultrusion manufacturing machines for BasaFlex™ production, plus other composite manufacturing equipment. Each Pultrusion machine has up to two linear production lines (we use one or two lines per machine depending on rebar size – giving a maximum capacity of 10 manufacturing lines). To date, BI’s operations team has successfully optimized and scaled the capacity of our manufacturing plant to produce up to 25,000 linear feet of BasaFlex™ rebar per shift, per day, depending on the product mix. BI’s own fully equipped test lab is utilized to evaluate, validate, and verify each product’s performance attributes. Depending our manufacturing needs in the future, we have and may continue to explore alternative or additional manufacturing or corporate facilities.
 
To satisfy what we perceive the market interest for BasaFlex™ to be, and in particular to address potential large-scale customers like CPPB, we need to significantly accelerate the expansion of our manufacturing capacity. Our current near-term goal is to expand our manufacturing capacity and ultimately to reach a Pompano plant production capacity exceeding 73,000 linear feet per day per day on a two day shift basis (which would be 3 times our current capacity). To accomplish these goals, we have designed and developed customized pultrusion equipment which offers significantly increased capacity in the same footprint as our current equipment. Our new technology manufacturing system, named BasaMax™, has been specifically designed for the manufacture of BasaFlex™ using our patent pending process. Two versions of this equipment have been designed, and these will not only offer double the capacity of our current equipment (per machine), but also each will run at faster and more efficient rates. A prototype has completed thorough testing in our Pompano facility, including initial production runs, and is currently undergoing modifications and upgrades to the final production configuration.
 
Based on this trial, we are planning a two-phase plant expansion, eventually including a total of 10 of these new machines. Our goal, subject to raising sufficient funding, is to have the first set of five of the new machines installed and be operational by the second quarter of 2022, and to install and have operational five more, along with additional custom manufacturing equipment, by the fourth quarter of 2022 providing sales dictate. This would create the opportunity for BI to ultimately reach our production level target for the Pompano facility by the close of 2022.
 
Competition
 
The competitive landscape for concrete reinforcement is intense and can generally be divided into two categories: steel reinforcement, the incumbent since its beginnings in the nineteenth century, and alternative fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement, which is gaining traction globally but remains a relatively new concept in the U.S. There is reinforcement of some type in most every cubic yard of concrete that is poured, and steel rebar producers are present in every major U.S. city. In contrast, there are only a handful of FRP manufacturers, and these can be segmented into 3 major types of FRPs used in construction rebar: carbon, fiberglass and basalt. We believe BFRP has a wider application temperature range, higher oxidation resistance, higher radiation resistance, higher compression strength and higher shear strength than its previously noted contemporaries. We believe it also represents the best value proposition.

We believe our major competitors in the BFRP space specifically include, Neuvokas, Kodiak, Armastek, Galen, Sudaglass and several manufacturers based in China. Other, non-basalt FRP competitors include Owens Corning/Mateen, Liberty, American Fiberglass Rebar, Tuf-Bar, Pulltrall and Pultron. As noted, BFRP is relatively new in the U.S., and thus we also compete with major international providers of traditional steel rebar. Given the early stage of our company, we believe all of our competitors are larger, more established, and more financially stable than our company.
 
Sources of Raw Materials
 
The sourcing of our raw materials is a primary focus for our management. It is incumbent upon us to pre-plan our requirements prior to, and in conjunction with, our actual growth and developing an understanding of manufacturing lead-times and other obstacles that may restrain the flow of our established supply chain. Our current suppliers are aware of our aggressive plans for growth and are committed to helping us achieve those plans by adding capacity and developing/expanding long term agreements, with commitments for growth. Our principal suppliers for basalt continuous fiber roving (which is a key component of BasaFlex) is Mafic, Inc., with BWF/Kamenny Vek and SRCS, Inc. as backup suppliers. Our principal suppliers for resin matrix ingredients are Aalchem, Phlex-Tek, Lindau Chemical and Cabot Labs.
Sales and Marketing
 
We primarily utilize third party distribution partners (such as USS, as described further below) to market and sell our products, with a small amount of direct marketing business that isn’t typically covered by distribution arrangements (such as one-off technology-driven segments on the construction industry such as ultra-high-performance concrete, engineered cementitious composite concrete or geopolymer concrete). We also can generate sales through private label arrangements for larger company as well as export sales. As part of our distribution-focused marketing efforts, we focus on design-build companies, engineering, and architectural firms, as well as military, federal, state and local government agencies in an effort to drive material acceptance and specification approvals. We have secured multiple independent representatives and distributors to date, as detailed in the graphic below, with plans to enter into arrangements to secure additional geographic coverage. We’ve also contracted with other representation to bring our products and message to other parts of the world.
 
Distribution Agreement with USS
 
In December 2021, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with USS. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we are responsible to provide engineering conversion calculations when required by USS for targeted construction projects. The conversion calculations support the use of BasaFlex™ BFRP rebar reinforcement, both in new designs or to replace steel reinforcement in existing designs. This engineering work will also be accomplished through the use of the BasaPro™ proprietary software, with a required review by a Florida licensed professional engineer. USS is responsible for, among other matters, obtaining any required import or export licenses necessary for us to ship our products, including certificates of origin, manufacturer's affidavits, and a U.S. Federal Communications Commission's identifier, if applicable and any other licenses required under US or foreign law.
 
The Distribution Agreement has a term of five (5) years, and thereafter the term shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless terminated by the parties prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term. The Distribution Agreement may be terminated (i) by the mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) upon breach of the Distribution Agreement (with a notice period and an opportunity to cure) and (iii) upon the bankruptcy and insolvency of a party.
 
The Distribution Agreement also contains other customary terms and conditions, including with respect to registration of USS customers, packaging, shipping, Product warranties, Product returns, insurance requirements, intellectual property, confidentiality, limitations on liability, indemnification, non-solicitation of employees, and representations and warranties of the parties.

Intellectual Property
 
Currently, we have a patent pending application with the USPTO for BasaFlex™, and plan to augment our intellectual property portfolio with other novel products, processes, and equipment. Additionally, we have secured registered trademarks on our company name as well as our key product names, including BasaFlex™; BasaMix™; BasaMesh™ and BasaWrap™, with the near-term intent to secure BasaPro, BasaMax and BasaLinks. These trade names represent our BFRP Rebar, Basalt Chopped Fiber, BFRP Geogrid Mesh, Basalt Reinforcing Wrap Kit, Software Program, Proprietary Pultrusion Equipment and Configured BFRP Shapes respectively.
Government Regulation
 
Basalt fiber reinforced polymer rebar is subject to various testing and certifications from various private and public entities, such as the Federal and State Departments of Transportation, the ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and the US Army Corps of Engineers, in order to satisfy regulatory requirements for manufacturing and use as concrete reinforcement. The American Concrete Institute (ACI), ASTM (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) and the International Code Council (ICC) have very specific testing regimen for FRP materials and strict guidelines regarding the acceptance criteria and certification process. It includes not only the products themselves, but the facility, the manufacturing equipment, and the quality control measures used in process as part of the overall approval. The testing protocols are very expensive and run approximately $30,000 per bar size for the full required testing protocols. However, once the products have met all the federal, state and local building code requirements, we believe doors will open for myriad other applications and opportunities. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure such approvals and certifications in the future. Furthermore, we are dependent on third party independent groups, such as university laboratories and other certifying bodies, to obtain approvals and certifications. Inability to secure approvals and certifications could materially harm our ability to generate revenue.
 
Moreover, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), particular with respect to our manufacturing facility. In order to maintain compliance with applicable OSHA requirements, we have established uniform safety and compliance procedures for our operations, and implemented measures designed to prevent workplace injuries. Our safety programs focus on job hazard identification and prevention, coupled with extensive on-going job-specific training.
 
We also are subject to environmental laws, rules, and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials, substances, and wastes, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. These laws, ordinances, and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. Many of them provide for substantial fines and penalties, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. They may also impose liability for property damage and personal injury stemming from the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. In addition, certain of our operations require us to obtain, maintain compliance with, and periodically renew, environmental permits. Certain of these environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), may require the investigation and cleanup of an entity’s or its predecessor’s current or former properties, even if the associated contamination was caused by the operations of a third party. These laws also may require the investigation and cleanup of third-party sites at which an entity or its predecessor sent hazardous wastes for disposal, notwithstanding that the original disposal activity accorded with applicable requirements. Liability under such laws may be imposed jointly and severally, and regardless of fault. In addition, our operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change.
 
We have incurred and, if our business grows, we will continue to incur, costs to comply with the requirements of health and safety, transportation, and environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations. These requirements could become more stringent in the future, and compliance costs may be material and places restrictions on our business that we will be required to manage.
