Item 1. Business
Akamai provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. As a global leader in content delivery network, or CDN, services, our goal is to make the Internet faster, more reliable and more secure for customers and users around the world. For many enterprises, engaging customers through high-quality digital experiences has become mission critical. We believe that is why thousands of organizations rely on Akamai and our cloud delivery platform to make it easier for them to provide the best and most secure digital experiences to their customers.
Our Strategy – Addressing the Needs of our Customers in the Internet Age
The Internet plays a crucial role in the way companies, government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public, and the world around us is rapidly evolving. The emergent network known as the Internet of Things (IoT) is connecting billions of devices that transmit volumes of data from offices, hospitals, manufacturing plants, power grids, roads, schools and homes every second. At the same time, security threats are growing more sinister and advanced. Enterprise applications are moving from behind the firewall to the cloud at the same time that employees increasingly need remote access from a variety of devices - making cybersecurity more complex to achieve than yesterday’s perimeter defense. More consumers are "cutting the cord" and consuming entertainment over the Internet rather than through traditional cable, and they are increasingly using mobile devices to view content and shop. Web pages are also vastly more complex with advertisements, videos, graphics and other third-party content, causing speed and reliability to suffer. More and more, government agencies want citizens to pay their taxes, submit applications and request information online. Smart enterprises want to take advantage of these trends safely, profitably and intelligently.
What our customers want to do:

• | Provide consumers with superior online experiences when they access websites and applications from all types of devices from anywhere in the world


• | Handle transactions securely and protect sensitive information


• | Affordably present vibrant and engaging streaming content at large scale, including high definition, or HD, video, music and games


• | Leverage the growth in the use of mobile devices to reach more consumers and provide dynamic experiences


• | Scale and secure the enterprise network


• | Receive and act on data about usage of their websites and applications to improve performance and business value

What makes it difficult to achieve those goals:

• | Doing it yourself – building out data centers, coping with the technology changes, and dealing with sudden traffic spikes – is difficult and expensive


• | Lack of a coordinated security system to protect against hackers, bots and other bad actors who want to steal assets and disrupt the functioning of the web can leave enterprises exposed


• | Mobile networks tend to be slower and less reliable than the fixed line Internet and present other challenges


• | Traffic congestion at data centers and between networks typically cannot be avoided without a CDN


• | User experiences are difficult to monitor and understand given myriad devices and locations


• | “Last mile” issues – such as bandwidth constraints between consumers and their Internet access provider – are challenging to solve

Special features available to enterprises that purchase our premium support solution include a dedicated technical account team, proactive service monitoring, custom technical support handling procedures and customized training. 
Our Technology and Network
The Akamai Intelligent Platform provides the technological underpinnings for all of our solutions. We use data generated in connection with each of our services to improve and augment the functionality of our overlay network and, in turn, to improve the effectiveness of our other services. In this approach, insights and learnings are integrated across the broader platform in service of our entire solution portfolio.
The Akamai Intelligent Platform leverages more than 200,000 servers deployed in more than 1,700 networks ranging from large, backbone network providers to medium and small Internet service providers, or ISPs, to cable modem and satellite providers to universities and other networks. By deploying servers within a wide variety of networks across more than 130 countries, we are better able to manage and control routing and delivery quality to geographically diverse users. We also have thousands of peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end-user networks, which reduce data loss, while also potentially giving us more options for delivery at reduced cost.
To make this wide-reaching deployment effective, we use specialized technologies, such as advanced routing, load balancing, data collection and monitoring. Our intelligent routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors experience fast page loading, access to applications and content assembly wherever they are on the Internet and regardless of global or local traffic conditions. Dedicated professionals staff our network operations command center 24 hours a day, seven days a week to monitor and react to Internet traffic patterns and trends. We frequently deploy enhancements to our software globally to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of our network. 
Our platform offers flexibility too. Customers can control the extent of their use of Akamai services to scale on demand, using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require, to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth without the need for expensive and complex internal infrastructure.
Research and Development
Our research and development personnel are continuously undertaking efforts to enhance and improve our existing services, strengthen our network and create new services in response to our customers' needs and market demand. As of December 31, 2017, we had 2,227 research and development employees. Our research and development expenses were $222.4 million, $167.6 million and $148.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are net of capitalized costs related to the development of internal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $149.3 million, $124.6 million and 
7

$105.7 million, respectively, of payroll, payroll-related and external consulting costs related to the development of internal-use software. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $26.8 million, $21.4 million and $16.7 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation attributable to our research and development personnel.
Industry Segment and Geographic Information
We operate in one industry segment: providing cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing content and business applications over the Internet. Our revenue derived from operations outside the U.S. was $855.0 million, $720.0 million and $593.0 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This represented 34% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, 31% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 27% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. No single country outside of the U.S. accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in any such year. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for revenue attributable to the U.S. for the periods presented and for a description of the basis on which we attribute revenue to individual countries.
Our long-lived assets include servers, which are deployed into networks worldwide, in addition to other property and equipment used to support our operations. We had net property and equipment, excluding internal use software, located in the U.S. of $311.7 million, $297.8 million and $298.9 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had net property and equipment, excluding internal use software, located outside of the U.S. of $249.8 million $231.8 million and $227.8 million, for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Customers
As of December 31, 2017, our customers included many of the world's leading corporations, including Airbnb, Alibaba, Apple, Autodesk, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cathay Pacific, The Coca-Cola Company, Crate & Barrel, eBay, Electronic Arts, FedEx, Fidelity Investments, Ford Motor Company, FOX, General Electric, Home Depot, HubSpot, IKEA, JetBlue, Marriott, NBCUniversal, Norwegian Cruise Line, Panasonic, Panera Bread, PayPal, Qantas, Qualcomm, Rabobank, Rakuten, Salesforce.com, Siemens, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Spotify, Ticketmaster, Toshiba, Turner Broadcasting, Ubisoft and Viacom.

No customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Six of our customers that are large Internet platform companies: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Netflix, or our Internet Platform Customers, in aggregate, accounted for 8%, 11% and 17% of our total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Less than 10% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was derived from contracts or subcontracts terminable at the election of the federal government, and we do not expect such contracts to account for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018.
Sales, Service and Marketing
We market and sell our solutions globally through our direct sales and service organization and through many channel partners including AT&T, Deutsche Telecom, IBM, Orange Business Services and Telefonica Group. In addition to entering into agreements with resellers, we have several other types of sales and marketing focused alliances with entities such as system integrators, application service providers, referral partners and sales agents. By aligning with these partners, we believe we are better able to market our services and encourage increased adoption of our technology throughout the industry.
Our sales, service and marketing professionals are based in locations across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia and focus on direct and channel sales, sales operations, professional services, account management and technical consulting. As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,594 employees in this organization. 
To support our sales efforts and promote the Akamai brand, we conduct comprehensive marketing programs. Our marketing strategies include an active public relations campaign, print advertisements, online advertisements, participation at trade shows, strategic alliances, ongoing customer communication programs, training and sales support.

Competition
The market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations. We expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:

• | the performance and reliability of our services;


• | return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers;


• | reduced infrastructure complexity;


• | sophistication and functionality of our offerings;


• | scalability;


• | security;


• | ease of implementation and use of service;


• | customer support; and


• | price.

We compete with companies offering products and services that address Internet performance problems, including companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting services, security solutions, technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems, streaming content delivery services and equipment-based solutions for Internet performance problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. In addition, existing and potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware, software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externally-managed services like Akamai.
We believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the Akamai Intelligent Platform, which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us. In our view, we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings, our customer service and the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value.
Proprietary Rights and Licensing
Our success and ability to compete are dependent on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our technology and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2017, we owned, or had exclusive rights to, more than 330 U.S. patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries. Our U.S.-issued patents have terms extendable to various dates between 2018 and 2036. We do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business. In October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a royalty-free, worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content delivery technology. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 7,650 full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work.
