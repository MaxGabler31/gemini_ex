ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Effective April 2, 2012, we changed our name to Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. (“BROG”). Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “ANFC”.
 
The Company is focused on acquiring, investing in, and managing the oil and gas assets for our partners. We continue to pursue asset acquisitions in all major onshore unconventional shale formations that may be acquired with capital from our existing joint venture partners or other capital providers. Additionally, as the sponsor and manager of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (“BRAC”), we will be focused on BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business in the energy or energy-related industries with an emphasis on opportunities in the upstream oil and gas industry in North America.
 
Rights Offering and BRAC IPO
 
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to register the issuance of 431,819,910 shares of common stock in a Rights Offering that was declared effective by the SEC on August 3, 2017 (the “Rights Offering”). Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed, on a pro rata basis, one right for each share of common stock owned by shareholders on August 2, 2017 (the “Record Date”). Each right permitted a shareholder to purchase up to nine shares of common stock at a subscription price of $0.012 per share. The Rights Offering expired on September 8, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”).
 
Associated with the Rights Offering the Company also entered into a Standby Purchase Agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”) with a consortium of investors, including members of the Company’s board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer (collectively, the “Backstop Purchasers”), who agreed to purchase up to $2.9 million of the unsubscribed shares following the completion of the rights offering.
 
On September 26, 2017, the Company finalized the Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement, and issued 431,819,910 shares raising gross proceeds of $5,181,839. Under the Rights Offering the Company’s current shareholders exercised rights to purchase 199,811,421 shares of stock for a total of $2,397,737. Under the Backstop Agreement, the Backstop Purchasers purchased 232,008,489 shares of stock for a total of $2,784,102. Additionally, as part of Backstop Agreement, the Company issued 435,000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $0.01 to participants in the Backstop Agreement. We incurred $130,164 in costs associated with raising the capital in Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement which were charged directly to stockholder’s equity. In October 2017, the Company used $4,450,000 of the net proceeds of the Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement to fulfill its obligation as sponsor of a special purpose acquisition company, Black Ridge Acquisition Corp., (“BRAC”), simultaneous with BRAC’s initial public offering (IPO) described below. BRAC was formed on May 9, 2017 with the purpose of becoming the special acquisition company as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The remaining proceeds from the Rights Offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes which may include other investments and acquisitions.
 
On October 10, 2017, the Company’s sponsored special purpose acquisition company, BRAC, completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) raising $138,000,000 of gross proceeds (including proceeds from the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters on October 18, 2017). BRAC is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region although it intends to focus its search for target businesses in the energy or energy-related industries with an emphasis on opportunities in the upstream oil and gas industry in North America. Following the initial public offering and over-allotment, the Company owns 22% of the outstanding common stock of BRAC and manages BRAC’s operations via a management services agreement.
 
The Company has determined that BRAC, following its IPO, is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company determined that, due to the redemption feature associated with the IPO shares, that the IPO shareholders are indirectly protected from the operating expenses of BRAC and it has the power to direct the activities of BRAC through the date at which BRAC affords the stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve a proposed business combination. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements contain the operations of the BRAC from its inception on May 9, 2017. BRAC’s IPO shareholders are reflected in our financial statements as a non-controlling interest. The non-controlling interest was recorded at fair value on October 10, 2017, with an addition on October 18, 2017 as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option. Hereafter the term “the Company” refers to the consolidated entity including BRAC.

Debt Restructuring
 
On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Contribution Agreement with Black Ridge Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BRHC”) which was formed by the Company to contribute and assign to BRHC, all of the Company's (i) oil and gas assets (including working capital and tangible and intangible assets) (the “Assets”), (ii) outstanding balances under the credit agreement between the Company, as borrower, and Cadence Bank, N.A. (“Cadence”), as lender (the “Cadence Credit Facility”) and the outstanding balances under the credit agreement between the Company, as borrower, and affiliates (specifically, Chambers Energy Capital II, LP and CEC II TE, LLC (collectively, the “Chambers Affiliates”)) of Chambers Energy Management, LP (“Chambers”), as administrative agent (the “Chambers Credit Facility”), and (iii) all current liabilities related to the Assets, in exchange for 5% of the issued and outstanding Class A Units (the “Class A Units”) in BRHC (the “Asset Contribution”). On March 29, 2016, the Chambers Affiliates entered into a Debt Contribution Agreement between BRHC and the Chambers Affiliates, pursuant to which BRHC issued a number of Class A Units representing 95% of the Class A Units of BRHC to the Chambers Affiliates in exchange for the release of BRHC's obligations under the Chambers Credit Facility (the “Satisfaction of Debt” and, together with the Asset Contribution, the “BRHC Transaction”). Concurrent with the Satisfaction of Debt, each warrant originally issued with the Chambers Credit Facility was automatically retired and cancelled. The closing of the BRHC Transaction was subject to the Company obtaining the approval of stockholders holding a majority of its outstanding capital stock and to the Company having assigned the Cadence Credit Agreement to BRHC with Cadence’s consent, and BRHC and Cadence entering into any applicable amendment agreements related to such assignment and waiver of financial covenant ratio compliance for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and quarter ending March 31, 2016. On June 21, 2016, the Company satisfied all of these conditions and, for accounting purposes, the BRHC Transaction was consummated. The parties have agreed that the BRHC Transaction, the Asset Contribution and the Satisfaction of Debt are effective, for valuation purposes, as of April 1, 2016.
 
Cancelation of Management Services Agreement and Sale of BRHC Investment
 
On April 3, 2017, we were notified by BRHC of their termination of our Management Services Agreement and that they had finalized the sale of BRHC’s oil and gas assets to a third party. On April 3, 2017, BRHC signed a Contribution Agreement that provides for the transfer of ownership and title of all oil and gas assets held by BRHC in exchange for preferred membership interest in the acquiring LLC (the “BRHC Sale”). Consistent with the terms of the Management Services Agreement, we were paid for our management services through June 30, 2017.
 
The Company, Chambers Energy Capital II, LP and CEC II TE, LLC (together with Chambers Energy Capital II, LP the “Chambers Affiliates”) as the members of Black Ridge Holding Company, LLC (“BRHC”) agreed to dissolve and wind up BRHC and filed a Certificate of Cancellation under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act as of October 3, 2017. On October 2, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with the Chambers Affiliates whereby certain assets distributed to the Company upon the dissolution and winding up of BRHC effective as of October 2, 2017, were sold to the Assignees in exchange for cash consideration of $1,078,394. Additionally, cash and receivables totaling $4,645 in value were distributed directly to the Company from BRHC.
 
Business
 
We believe we create value through identifying and targeting acreage positions with attractive returns on the capital employed by evaluating, amongst other factors, reserve potential, operator performance, anticipated well costs and anticipated operating expenses. Our management team has significant access to both publicly available and proprietary business combination opportunities and has collectively bid on over $2.4 billion of opportunities with private equity sponsors since June 2015.
 
With the experience and connections of our personnel across a variety of onshore unconventional oil and gas plays, we believe that we are able to create value for our partners through opportunistic acquisitions development and subsequent divestitures. We believe our experience and relationships enhance our ability to identify and acquire high value prospects and manage them effectively.
 
As the sponsor and manager of Back Ridge Acquisition Corp. (“BRAC”), we will be focused on BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business in the energy or energy-related industries with an emphasis on opportunities in the upstream oil and gas industry in North America.
 
Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Our principal agreements for our continuing operations take the form of management service agreements, whereby our partners pay a fee to us for managing the business operations and day-to-day transactions of the business, and joint venture agreements, whereby joint ventures are funded by our partners and we are paid a fee to identify prospective oil and gas related investments for purchase and manage the day-to-day operations of those assets once purchased. Under the joint venture agreements, after certain investor hurdles are met, the Company will generally receive a share of profits in the joint venture.

Employees
 
We currently have 7 full time employees. We may hire additional technical or administrative personnel as appropriate. However, we do not expect a significant change in the number of full time employees over the next 12 months based upon our currently-projected business plan. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services for us or on behalf of our partners. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
Office Locations
 
Our executive offices are located at 110 North Fifth Street, Suite 410, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55403. Our office space consists of approximately 2,786 square feet leased pursuant to an annual lease agreement that commenced on July 1, 2016 and continued on a month-to-month basis beginning July 1, 2017.
