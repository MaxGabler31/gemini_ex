(1) | OCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT
----+-----------------------------

​
Ocean Transportation Services:
​
Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:
​
Hawaii Service:  Matson’s Hawaii service provides ocean carriage (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Matson also operates a network of inter-island barges that provide connecting services from its hub at Honolulu to other major Hawaii ports on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.
​
Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, food and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods. Matson’s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities and livestock. The majority of Matson’s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight.
​
China Service: Matson’s expedited China-Long Beach Express (“CLX”) service is part of an integrated service that carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, to Guam, and then to Okinawa, Japan. The vessels continue to Ningbo and Shanghai, China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily in Long Beach, California at a Matson-exclusive terminal operated by SSAT. These vessels also carry cargo destined for Hawaii which originated in Guam, Micronesia, Okinawa, China and other Asian countries. Matson provides container transshipment services from many locations in Asia including Hong Kong and Xiamen, China to the United States via the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai, China. 
​
In May 2020, as a result of increased market demand, Matson launched its second expedited service to the U.S. West Coast with the China-Long Beach Express Plus (“CLX+”) service. The CLX+ service uses chartered vessels and operates weekly from Ningbo and Shanghai, China where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged primarily at Long Beach, California, calling at an SSAT operated terminal. 
​
In July 2021, Matson launched a temporary, third expedited service to the U.S. West Coast with the China-California Express (“CCX”) service to meet continued high market demand. The CCX service uses Matson-owned vessels and departs Shanghai, China every three out of five weeks with direct service to Oakland, California and then to Long Beach, California. Cargo at both Oakland and Long Beach, California, is discharged at Matson exclusive terminals operated by SSAT. Matson expects the CCX service to operate through the October peak season of 2022. Matson’s expedited China service currently consists of the CLX, CLX+ and the CCX services. 
​
Eastbound cargo from China to Long Beach, California consists mainly of garments, e-commerce related goods, consumer electronics, footwear and other merchandise. 
​
Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service provides weekly carriage between the U.S. West Coast and Guam, as part of its CLX service. Matson also provides weekly connecting service from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Cargo destined to these markets is similar to that described under “Hawaii Service” above. 
​
Japan Service: Matson’s Japan service provides carriage to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan, as part of its CLX service. This service mainly carries general sustenance cargo and household goods supporting the U.S. military.
​
Micronesia Service: Matson’s Micronesia service provides carriage between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam and consists mainly of general sustenance cargo.

​
Northbound cargo to Alaska consists mainly of dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods and automobiles. Southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of seafood, household goods and automobiles.
​
In September 2020, Matson launched its Alaska-Asia Express (“AAX”) service that provides carriage of dry and frozen seafood from Dutch Harbor, Alaska to Ningbo and Shanghai, China. The AAX service utilizes CLX+ vessels on their westbound trip to China. Matson also provides transshipment services from Ningbo and Shanghai, China to other locations in Asia. 
​
South Pacific Service: Matson’s New Zealand Express (“NZX”) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo between Auckland, New Zealand and select islands in the South Pacific, including Fiji (Suva and Lautoka), Samoa (Apia), American Samoa (Pago Pago), the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki), Tonga (Nukualofa and Vava’u), and Niue. Matson’s NZX service also provides transshipment services to the islands of Nauru and the Solomon Islands (Honiara). Additionally, Matson provides slot charter arrangements for the transportation of cargo from major ports on the east coast of Australia to ports in the South Pacific islands. The NZX service also distributes and sells domestic bulk fuel to a variety of these islands.
​
Matson’s South Pacific Express (“SPX”) service provides carriage of general sustenance cargo from the U.S. West Coast to ports in the South Pacific islands using vessel sharing agreements with other carriers. The SPX service provides direct calls to Tahiti (Papeete), American Samoa (Pago Pago) and Samoa (Apia) in the South Pacific. Cargo destined for other ports including Tonga (Nukualofa) and the Cook Islands (Rarotonga and Aitutaki) is then transshipped in Apia, Samoa to the NZX service for delivery to its final destination. Northbound SPX cargo originating in the South Pacific is transshipped from the NZX service with other carriers to the U.S. West Coast. Cargo destined for Hawaii or Washington is further transshipped in Oakland, California for delivery to its final destination. 
​
In June 2021, Matson launched its new China-Auckland Express (“CAX”) service that operates from Shanghai, China to Auckland, New Zealand to meet increased demand from China.

Vessel Emission Regulations: 
​
Being a leader in environmental stewardship is one of Matson’s core values.  Matson’s vessels transit through some of the most environmentally sensitive areas in the United States including the Hawaiian Islands and the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  Matson is focused in particular on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide through improvements in vessel fuel consumption, choice of fuel types and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions.  Matson further contributes positively to the environment by testing and deploying leading technologies as the fleet is modernized.  
​
The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), to which the U.S. and over 100 other countries are signatories, is a specialized agency of the United Nations that sets international environmental standards applicable to vessels operating under the flag of any signatory country.  Effective January 1, 2020, the IMO imposed regulations that generally require all vessels to burn fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent (“IMO 2020”).  There are three main options for a vessel to meet the IMO 2020 requirements: (1) burn low sulfur fuel oil (“LSFO”), (2) install exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly referred to as “scrubbers”) on vessels to reduce sulfur emissions from heavy fuel oil (“HFO”), or (3) switch to lower emission fuels such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”), which requires converting existing vessels or constructing new vessels with LNG-capable engines and fuel tanks.  With respect to North America, all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coastlines have been designated emission control areas (“ECAs”).  Since January 1, 2015, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content in designated ECAs to ≤0.1 percent or the equivalent emissions by the use of scrubbers. In addition, since August 1, 2012, the California Air Resource Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Vessel General Permit regulations have reduced the fuel oil maximum sulfur content to ≤0.1 percent within 24 miles of the California coastline and within Puget Sound.  
​
All of Matson’s vessels in the Alaska and Hawaii services are designed to operate in compliance with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations as applicable, and can use LSFO.  In the Alaska and Hawaii services, Matson installed scrubbers on ten diesel engine-powered vessels to allow them to use HFO and still comply with IMO 2020 and ECA regulations. Matson also maintains vessels which may operate as dry-dock relief or for emergency activation purposes under an EPA approved ECA permit enabling the use of fuel oil with a maximum sulfur content of ≤0.5 percent within the North America ECA or at any time on IMO compliant fuels.  Matson’s Aloha and Kanaloa Class vessels burn compliant LSFO.  These vessels are also equipped with dual-fuel engines and can be converted to run on LNG.  All of Matson’s other vessels use LSFO to meet IMO 2020 and ECA emission standards.
​
In June 2021, the IMO adopted new greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission requirements applicable to ships. Beginning with a company’s first annual, intermediate or renewal survey for an international air pollution prevention certificate on or after January 1, 2023, all containerships with more than 10,000 dead weight tons will be required to meet specified Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (“EEXI”) levels. EEXI is a one-time certification measuring a ship’s theoretical carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per transport work based on its design parameters. After 2023, containerships with over 5,000 gross tonnage (“GT”) will be required to meet annual Carbon Intensity Indicator (“CII”) requirements that become increasingly stringent towards 2030. CII measures how efficiently a ship transports goods, and uses actual CO2 emissions to determine an annual rating from A to E. For ships that achieve a D rating for three consecutive years or an E rating in a single year, a corrective action plan needs to be developed as part of the vessels’ Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (“SEEMP”) and approved. For a discussion on the Company’s planned future capital expenditures to comply with these regulations, see Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. For more information on Matson’s environmental stewardship initiatives, including GHG emission reduction goals, see Matson’s Sustainability Report and other information available at www.matson.com/sustainability.
​
Hawaii Terminal Modernization and Expansion Program:
​
During 2020, Matson completed the first phase of its program to modernize and renovate its terminal facility at Sand Island, Honolulu, Hawaii. As part of this phase, Matson completed the installation of three new 65 long-ton capacity gantry cranes, upgraded and renovated three existing cranes, demolished four outdated cranes, and installed upgrades to the electrical infrastructure at the terminal. 
​
During 2021, as part of the second phase, Matson completed the installation, energization and transition to a new redundant main switchgear. Additional projects for this phase relate to improvements to its existing backup power 

5




generators, installation of new above ground fuel storage tanks, a battery energy storage system, and other upgrades at the terminal, and are expected to be completed within the next three years. 
​
The next phase represents a broader and long-term terminal expansion program at the Sand Island terminal facility. Matson expects to expand into Pier 51A and portions of Pier 51B after Pasha Hawaii (“Pasha”) relocates to the newly constructed Kapalama container terminal facility planned for 2024. From 2022 to 2024, Matson will be performing surveying, planning and design work in preparation for this expansion.
​
Ocean Transportation Equipment:
​
As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson owns a variety of equipment including cranes, terminal equipment, containers and chassis, which represents an investment of approximately $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.
​
Operating Costs:
​
Major components of Matson’s Ocean Transportation operating costs are as follows:
​
Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs including labor, purchased outside transportation and other related costs. 
​
Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs; fuel, pilots, tugs and line related costs; vessel charter expenses; and other vessel operating related expenses. Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations and also pays fuel-related surcharges to other third party transportation providers.
​
Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, depreciation and dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.
​
Competition:
​
The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment:
​
Hawaii Service: Matson’s Hawaii service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Pasha, which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California to Hawaii. A U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operator, Aloha Marine Lines, also offers barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.
​
Foreign-flagged vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii. Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo, and airfreight freight carriers.
​
Matson operates three strings of vessels to Hawaii. These strings provide customers an industry-leading five departures from ports on the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii every week – two each from Long Beach and Oakland, California and one from Tacoma, Washington. Each of these strings operates on a fixed day-of-the-week schedule. Two of the vessel strings continue from Honolulu to China before returning to Long Beach. Matson’s frequent sailings and punctuality permit customers to reduce inventory carrying costs. Matson also competes by offering one of the most comprehensive services to customers, including: the only container service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast with three exclusive use terminals provided by SSAT; a dedicated inter-island barge network which is integrated with Matson’s line haul schedule; roll-on/roll-off service from Long Beach and Oakland; a world-class customer service team; and efficiency and experience in handling cargo of many types.
​
Alaska Service: Matson’s Alaska service has one major U.S. flagged Jones Act competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. There are also two U.S. flagged Jones Act barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines, which mainly provides services from Seattle, Washington to the ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge,

which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations. The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers. Foreign-flagged vessels provide alternatives for companies shipping cargo (mainly seafood) from the Alaska ports of Kodiak and Dutch Harbor. Other competition includes air freight and over-the-road trucking services. Matson’s AAX service has two major competitors, CMA CGM and Maersk Lines, which provide services between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and Asia.
​
Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled service from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska, and a weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood. Matson offers dedicated terminal services at the Alaska ports of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor performed by Matson, and at the port of Tacoma, Washington performed by SSAT. Matson’s AAX service also offers customers a service from Dutch Harbor, Alaska to Ningbo and Shanghai, China, with transshipment services from those ports to other locations in Asia.
​
China Service: Major competitors to Matson’s China service include large international carriers such as CMA CGM, OOCL, ZIM, Evergreen and Maersk. Other competition includes air freight carriers.
​
Matson’s China service competes by offering fast and reliable service from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China, and feeder services from other Asian ports of origin, to Long Beach and Oakland, California. Matson provides fixed day-of-the-week arrivals and industry leading cargo availability. Matson’s service is further differentiated by best-in-class stevedoring services provided by SSAT, Matson dedicated terminal space, access to Shippers Transport Express off-dock container yards for faster truck turn times, Matson-dedicated equipment including chassis to speed cargo availability, one-stop intermodal connections, and world-class customer service. Matson also provides intermodal services in coordination with Matson Logistics. Matson has offices located in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Hong Kong, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.
​
Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service has one major competitor, APL, a U.S. flagged subsidiary of CMA CGM, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments to U.S. flagged feeder vessels in Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea. Waterman operates a roll-on/roll-off service, which periodically calls at Guam. There are also several foreign carriers, including CMA CGM, that call at Guam from foreign origin ports.
​
Matson offers customers a weekly service to Guam as part of the CLX service from three ports on the U.S. West Coast. Matson’s ocean transit time, frequent sailing and reliable on-time performance provides an industry-leading service to its customers. 
​
Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service has one major competitor, APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan.
​
Matson offers customers a weekly service to the port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan as part of the CLX service from three ports on the U.S. West Coast. 
​
Micronesia and South Pacific Services: Matson’s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.
​
Customer Concentration:
​
Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. The Company’s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers account for approximately 15 percent of the Company’s Ocean Transportation revenue. For additional information on Ocean Transportation revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.

Seasonality:
​
Historically, Matson’s Ocean Transportation services have typically experienced seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volume starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters. This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade. As a result, earnings have tended to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is typically driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons. Freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.
​
Since 2020, Matson’s typical seasonal trends have been impacted by the global pandemic which has resulted in elevated levels of demand experienced in our Ocean Transportation services. Matson’s expanded services in China and other locations have resulted in significant increases in volume during the second half of 2020 and throughout 2021. Supply chain congestion and elevated levels of demand are expected to impact the Company’s Ocean Transportation services during 2022. 
​
​
Maritime Laws and the Jones Act:
​
Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).
​
The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy. Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members. Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 41 percent, 62 percent and 72 percent, respectively, of Matson’s Ocean Transportation revenues came from the Hawaii and Alaska trades that were subject to the Jones Act. Matson’s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market. The commerce of both Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska, due to its geographical location, are dependent on ocean transportation. The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations. Matson’s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified and maintained in compliance with such requirements.
​
Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (“AMP”), which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress and the Executive Branch. Matson believes that the geopolitical environment has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support. AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flagged vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.
​
Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.
​
Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 90 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services. Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions.

Rate Regulations and Fuel-Related Surcharges:
​
Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates. A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Matson generally seeks to provide a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and other charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible.
​
Matson’s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S.-foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). The FMC is a federal independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of international ocean-borne transportation to and from the U.S. 
​
Matson applies a fuel-related surcharge rate to its Ocean Transportation customers. Matson’s fuel-related surcharge is correlated to market rates for fuel prices and other factors, and is intended to help Matson recover fuel-related expenses.
​
Other Environmental Regulations:
​
In addition to the vessel emission regulations discussed above, Matson’s operations are required to comply with other environmental regulations and requirements including the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Matson is also subject to state regulations affecting terminal and vessel emissions, such as the requirement to shut down vessel generator engines while at berth at California ports and switch to shore electrical power. The Company actively monitors its operations for compliance with these and other regulations.

​

Operating Costs:
​
Matson Logistics’ operating costs primarily consist of the costs of purchased transportation, leases of warehouses, cross-dock and other facility operating costs, salaries and benefits, and other operating overhead. 
​
Competition:
​
Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services. The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. 
​
Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services compete most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Hub Group, XPO and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt. Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; real-time visibility into the movement of customers’ goods; and other technology solutions. Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo.
​
Matson Logistics’ freight forwarding services compete most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company.
​
Customer Concentration:
​
Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations. The Company’s 10 largest logistics customers account for approximately 25 percent of the Company’s Logistics revenue. For additional information on Logistics revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below.
​
Seasonality:
​
In general, Matson Logistics’ services are not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, with the exception of its freight forwarding service to Alaska which may be affected by winter weather and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry. However, Matson’s Logistics businesses are being impacted by the global pandemic which has resulted in elevated levels of demand for our Logistics services that is expected to continue during 2022. 
​
​

C. | EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
---+------------------------------

​
Human Capital Strategy:
​
In support of Matson’s vision to be a great place to work for all employees, the Company focuses on a variety of human capital programs that have been developed to attract, retain and motivate its employee workforce. As a company that operates in various global locations, the Company’s human capital programs are designed to reflect the unique market practices in each geographic location. The Company’s success depends in part on employing a diverse, talented and engaged workforce that reflects its local communities, supports an environment of high standards and performance, and thrives in the Company’s collaborative and respectful culture. 
​

During 2021, Matson had 4,259 employees worldwide, of which 147 employees were based in international locations and 3,040 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. These numbers include seagoing personnel who rotate through billets (as described below) and temporary employees, but do not include employees of SSAT or other non-employee affiliates such as agents and contractors. The composition of Matson’s workforce by geography is as follows: 
​
​
Matson’s fleet of active vessels requires 392 billets to operate. Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore. These amounts exclude billets related to Matson’s foreign flagged chartered vessels where the vessel owner is responsible for its seagoing personnel. Matson’s vessel management services also employed personnel in 32 billets to manage three U.S. government vessels.
​
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion:
​
For many years, Matson has been committed to improving diversity, providing equal pay for equal work and creating an inclusive culture. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, traditionally the shipping industry’s workforce has been predominately represented by white males. While Matson’s workforce is representative of many of the communities where it operates, the Company has taken steps to do more to change the status quo within the Company and industry. In 2021, the Company continued to advance many of its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. This includes continuing its efforts to analyze pay among various employee groups to confirm pay equity across the Company. Externally, the Company supports programs intended to help build a diverse talent pool for Matson and its industry. In 2020, the Company committed $100,000 toward creation of new Matson scholarships to be offered in conjunction with 16 higher education institutions and maritime academies in its communities with the goal of increasing diversity among those pursuing studies in transportation and logistics. The first scholarships were granted in Fall 2021. Separately, the Company committed more than $200,000 to fund paid internships with the goal of providing professional work experience opportunities and promoting the Company and the industry to a diverse group of students in its various regional locations. The first internships under this program are anticipated for Summer 2022.

“Minority” in these graphs refers to any employee who self-identifies as such under the categories established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
​
Total Rewards Programs:
​
Matson provides a highly competitive and balanced total rewards program designed to attract, retain and motivate its employees. While factors such as job, location and business unit ultimately determine which plans an employee may be eligible for participation, the Company’s total rewards offering includes market competitive base salaries, cash and equity incentives, recognition awards, health and welfare benefits, and employee and employer funded retirement plans. The Company believes that management level positions should have a portion of pay aligned with its short- and long-term business objectives. Accordingly, the Company’s total rewards program contains several pay-for-performance components tied to individual, business unit and company performance, as well as Matson stock price performance.
​
Succession and Career Planning:
​
Matson’s workforce is characterized by uniquely skilled, long-tenured employees. To create career pathways for future leaders while planning for the loss of retiring employees, the Company takes a proactive approach to succession and career planning. The Company focuses on providing the next generation of promising talent with the tools they need to build their own careers at Matson. In 2021, 46 percent of open positions were filled through internal promotions. The Company also provided approximately 3,200 hours of employee training and development, while giving annual performance reviews to its non-union workforce.
​
For more information on Matson’s human capital programs, see our Sustainability Report which is available at www.matson.com/sustainability. 
​
Bargaining Agreements:
​
Matson’s shoreside and seagoing employees are represented by a variety of unions. As shown in the chart below, union employees comprise 71 percent of Matson’s global workforce.
​
​
Matson has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future, including as early as 2022. While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its operations, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lockouts or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson’s operations. 
​
Additionally, Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (“PMA”), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) on the U.S. West Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor. In August 2017, the ILWU agreed to extend its contract with the PMA to July 1, 2022. The Company believes that the renegotiation of this contract will be completed during 2022.
​
Multi-employer Pension and Post-retirement Plans:
​
Matson contributes to a number of multi-employer pension and post-retirement plans. Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from, and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans to which it contributes (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans).

Item 1 of Part 1 for additional information on Maritime Laws and the Jones Act). Participants of the CCF must also meet certain U.S. citizenship requirements. 
​
Deposits into the CCF are limited by certain applicable earnings and other conditions. Such deposits, once made, are available as tax deductions in the Company’s income tax provision. Qualified withdrawals from the CCF do not give rise to a current income tax liability, but reduce the depreciable basis of the vessels or certain related equipment for income tax purposes. However, if withdrawals are made from the CCF for general corporate purposes or other non-qualified purposes, or upon termination of the agreement, they are taxable with interest payable from the year of deposit.
​
Deposits not committed for qualified purposes within 25 years from the date of deposit will be treated as non-qualified withdrawals over the subsequent five years. Under the terms of the CCF agreement, the Company may designate certain qualified earnings as “accrued deposits” or may designate, as obligations of the CCF, qualified withdrawals to reimburse qualified expenditures initially made with operating funds. Such accrued deposits to, and withdrawals from, the CCF are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets either as obligations of the Company’s current assets or as receivables from the CCF.
​
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $9.8 million and $1.7 million of eligible accounts receivable were assigned to the CCF, respectively. Due to the nature of the assignment of eligible accounts receivable into the CCF, such assigned amounts are classified as part of accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts on deposit in the CCF invested in a money market fund, which is classified as other long-term assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, were nominal.

The Credit Agreement extended the maturity date to March 31, 2026, and retained the existing committed aggregate borrowings of up to $650 million. The Credit Agreement amended certain covenants and other terms set forth in the prior credit agreement, including (i) amending the pricing grid to provide for pricing ranging from, at the Company’s election, LIBOR plus a margin between 1.00 percent and 1.75 percent depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio, or base rate plus a margin between 0.00 percent and 0.75 percent depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio; (ii) reducing the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio to 3.50 to 1.0, with an option for a one-time increase to 4.0 to 1.0 in connection with a material acquisition; and (iii) removing certain additional limitations on stock redemptions and repurchases, sale and leaseback transactions and asset sales during the period from March 31, 2020 through and including December 30, 2021 that were added in March 2020, and (iv) removing certain additional limitations on incurrence of priority debt through December 21, 2027 that were added in March 2020.

The Company had $8.0 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Based on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio, which stipulates borrowing margins, the interest rate applicable to the revolving credit facility was approximately 1.10 percent at December 31, 2021. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are classified as long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as principal payments are not required until the maturity date.

9. | LEASES
---+-------

​
Description of Operating Leases: The Company has different types of operating leases, the specific terms and conditions of which vary from lease to lease. Certain operating lease agreements include terms such as: (i) renewal and early termination options; (ii) early buy-out and purchase options; and (iii) rent escalation clauses. The lease agreements also include provisions for the maintenance of the leased asset and payment of lease related costs. The Company reviews the specific terms and conditions of each lease and, as appropriate, notifies the lessor of any intent to exercise any option in accordance with the terms of the lease. In the normal course of business, the Company expects to be able to renew or replace most of its operating leases with other similar leases as they expire. The Company’s leases do not contain any other residual value guarantees.
​
The Company’s sub-lease income was nominal to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company did not have any finance leases during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments that may be adjusted in the future based on economic conditions and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Variable lease expense is disclosed for the adjusted portion of such payments.
​
The lease type by underlying asset class and maximum terms of the Company’s operating leases are as follows:​

--------------------------------------+---+---------
Lease Type: | | Term 
Real estate and terminal leases | | 65 years
Vessel charter leases | | 10 years
Operations equipment and other leases | | 8 years 

​
Incremental Borrowing Rate: As most of the Company’s operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the date of adoption and subsequent lease commencement dates in calculating the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined using the U.S. Treasury rate adjusted to account for the Company’s credit rating and the collateralized nature of operating leases.
​
Components of Lease Cost: Components of lease cost recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following:

The net proceeds from the sales were $14.3 million, and the gain on the disposal of the equipment was not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company subsequently leased back the equipment under a five-year operating lease agreement, and the obligations under the lease are included in the maturities of operating lease liabilities table above. There were no sale and leaseback transactions during 2021 and 2019. 
​
Termination of Vessel Charter: On November 26, 2018, MatNav entered into agreements whereby the MatNav owned vessel Maunalei was sold for $106.0 million and subsequently leased back from the buyer-lessor under a Bareboat Charter Agreement (the “Charter”). The transaction qualified for sale and leaseback treatment under ASC 840, Leases, with the Charter treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes. Lease payments were approximately $3.0 million per quarter, and the base term of the Charter was five years with a two year end-of-term renewal option. 
​
On July 7, 2021, MatNav entered into an agreement to terminate the Charter for $95.8 million, thereby acquiring the vessel. The Company paid for the termination with a combination of cash on hand and borrowing on the revolving credit facility. The Company derecognized the related right-of-use (“ROU”) asset of $27.4 million and ROU liability of $28.5 million, and increased property and equipment by $94.7 million, net.

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from these deferred assets will not be realized. The Company recorded a decrease to its valuation allowance of $4.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
​

63




Net Operating Losses and Tax Credit Carryforwards: The Company’s NOLs and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------------------+---+---------------------------------+---+------+-------+------+---+------
(In millions) | ​ | Expiration Date | | 2021 | | 2020
U.S. Federal income tax NOLs | ​ | Various dates beginning in 2027 | ​ | $ | 2.4 | ​ | $ | 7.6

Foreign income tax NOLs | ​ | No expiration date | ​ | $ | 8.8 | ​ | $ | 11.9 


(1) | U.S. State income tax NOLs are presented on a gross tax basis. The Company does not expect to benefit from $157.9 million of U.S. State income tax NOLs as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The U.S. federal and state income tax NOLs in the Company’s filed income tax returns include unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits. As a result of changes in tax legislation, the use of a portion of the Company’s domestic NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the federal and state income tax NOLs and tax credit carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. 
​
Unrecognized Tax Benefits: Total unrecognized benefits represent the amount that, if recognized, would favorably affect the Company’s incomes taxes and effective tax rate in future periods. The Company does not expect a material change in gross unrecognized benefits in the next twelve months. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------------------------+---+--------+-------+--
Unrecognized Tax Benefits (in millions) | | Amount | 
Balance at December 31, 2018 | ​ | $ | 15.1 | ​
Changes in tax positions of prior years, net | ​ | | 2.1 | ​
Reductions for lapse of statute of limitations | ​ | ​ | (0.8) | ​
Balance at December 31, 2019 | ​ | | 16.4 | ​
Changes in tax positions of prior years, net | ​ | | 2.1 | ​
Reductions for lapse of statute of limitations | ​ | ​ | (0.2) | ​
Balance at December 31, 2020 | ​ | | 18.3 | ​
Changes in tax positions of prior years, net | ​ | | 1.1 | ​
Reductions for lapse of statute of limitations | ​ | ​ | (0.2) | ​
Balance at December 31, 2021 | ​ | $ | 19.2 | ​

​
Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 are potential benefits of $19.2 million that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s income taxes and effective tax rate. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. To the extent interest and penalties are not ultimately assessed with respect to the settlement of uncertain tax positions, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the Company’s income taxes. Interest accrued related to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits totaled $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits for years before 2015. The Company is routinely involved in federal, state, local income and excise tax audits, and foreign tax audits.
​
​

11. | PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS
----+----------------------------------

​
Non-bargaining Plans:
​
The Company has two funded qualified single-employer defined benefit pension plans that cover certain non-bargaining unit employees and bargaining unit employees. In addition, the Company has plans that provide certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits to substantially all salaried, non-bargaining employees hired before 2008 and to certain bargaining unit employees. Employees are generally eligible for such benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of service. The Company does not pre-fund these health care and life insurance benefits, and has the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans in the future. Most non-bargaining retirees pay a portion of the benefit costs.
​

64




Plan Administration, Investments and Asset Allocations: The Company has a Benefits Investment Committee that meets regularly with investment advisors to establish investment policies, direct investments and select investment options for the qualified plans. The Benefits Investment Committee is also responsible for appointing investment managers and monitoring their performance. The Company’s investment policy permits investments in marketable equity securities, such as domestic and foreign stocks, domestic and foreign bonds, venture capital, real estate investments, and cash equivalents. The Company’s investment policy does not permit direct investment in certain types of assets, such as options or commodities, or the use of certain strategies, such as short selling or the purchase of securities on margin.
​
The Company’s investment strategy for its qualified pension plan assets is to achieve a diversified mix of investments that provides for long-term growth at an acceptable level of risk, and to provide sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing benefit payments. The Company has engaged a number of investment managers to implement various investment strategies to achieve the desired asset class mix, liquidity and risk diversification objectives.
​
The Company’s target and actual asset allocations at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------+---+--------+---+------+---+------+--
Asset Categories | | Target | | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Domestic equity securities | | 53 | % | 61 | % | 60 | %
International equity securities | | 15 | % | 16 | % | 17 | %
Debt securities | | 22 | % | 15 | % | 17 | %
Real estate | | 5 | % | 6 | % | 5 | %
Other and cash | | 5 | % | 2 | % | 1 | %
Total | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

​
The Company’s investments in equity securities primarily include domestic large-cap and mid-cap companies, but also includes an allocation to small-cap and international equity securities. Equity investments do not include any direct holdings of the Company’s stock but may include such holdings to the extent that the stock is included as part of certain mutual fund holdings. Debt securities include investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Other types of investments include funds that invest in commercial real estate assets. All assets within specific funds are allocated to the target asset allocation of the fund.
​
The expected return on plan assets is principally based on the Company’s historical returns combined with the Company’s long-term future expectations regarding asset class returns, the mix of plan assets, and inflation assumptions. Actual return on plan assets for the periods presented are as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------------------------------+---+---------+--
Actual Return on Plan Assets | | Returns | 
One-year return | | 14.9 | %
Three-year return | | 16.4 | %
Five-year return | | 11.1 | %
Long-term average return (since plan inception in 1989) | | 8.7 | %

​
The Company’s pension plan assets are held in a master trust and are stated at estimated fair values of the underlying investments. Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
​
Equity Securities: Domestic and international common stocks are valued by obtaining quoted prices on recognized and highly liquid exchanges.
​
Fixed Income Securities: Corporate bonds and U.S. government treasury and agency securities are valued based upon the closing price reported in the market in which the security is traded. U.S. government agency and corporate asset-backed securities may utilize models, such as a matrix pricing model, that incorporate other observable inputs when broker/dealer quotes are not available, such as cash flow, security structure, or market information.
​
Real Estate and Private Equity Funds: The fair value of real estate and private equity funds is determined by the issuer based on their net asset value (“NAV”). NAV is determined by dividing the fund’s net assets, as recorded in the fund’s audited financial statements, by the number of units outstanding at the valuation date. Fair value for underlying investments in real estate is determined through independent property appraisals.

​
Contributions to each of the qualified single-employer defined benefit pension plans are determined annually by the Company’s pension administrative committee, based upon the actuarially determined minimum required contribution under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended, the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and the maximum deductible contribution allowed for tax purposes. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $9.0 million, $9.0 million and $10 million, respectively, in pension contributions in these plans. 
​
The benefit formulas for employees who are members of collective bargaining units are determined according to the collective bargaining agreements, either using final average pay as the base or a flat dollar amount per year of service.​
Effective December 31, 2011, the Company froze benefit accruals under the final average pay formula for salaried, non-bargaining unit employees hired before January 1, 2008 and transitioned them to the same cash balance formula for employees hired on or after January 1, 2008. Retirement benefits under the cash balance formula are based on a fixed percentage of employee eligible compensation, plus interest. The plan interest credit rate will vary from year to year based on the ten-year U.S. Treasury rate.
​
Benefit Plan Assets and Obligations: The measurement date for the Company’s benefit plan disclosures is December 31 of each year.​

Unrecognized gains and losses of the post-retirement benefit plans are amortized over five years. Although current health care costs are expected to increase, the Company attempts to mitigate these increases by maintaining caps on certain of its benefit plans, using lower cost health care plan options where possible, requiring that certain groups of employees pay a portion of their benefit costs, self-insuring for certain insurance plans, encouraging wellness programs for employees, and implementing measures to mitigate future benefit cost increases.

Non-qualified Pension Plans: The Company has non-qualified supplemental pension plans covering certain employees and retirees, which provide for incremental pension payments from the Company’s general funds so that total pension benefits would be substantially equal to amounts that would have been payable from the Company’s qualified pension plans if it were not for limitations imposed by income tax law. A few employees and retirees receive additional supplemental pension benefits. Non-qualified pension plan liabilities recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and expenses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

​
Defined Contribution Plans: The Company sponsors defined contribution plans that qualify under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may make discretionary matching contributions equal to a specified percentage of each participant’s 401(k) contributions and makes other non-discretionary contributions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company provided discretionary matching contributions of up to 3 percent of eligible employee compensation. The Company’s matching contributions expensed in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $3.2 million, $3.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively. 
​
The Company may also provide a discretionary profit sharing contribution under the qualified defined contribution plans, to salaried, non-bargaining unit employees, if both a minimum threshold of Company performance is achieved and the Board has approved the profit sharing contribution. For certain eligible employees, supplemental profit sharing contributions are credited under a non-qualified plan to be paid after separation from service from the Company’s general funds so that total profit sharing contributions would be substantially equal to amounts that would have been contributed to the Company’s qualified defined contribution plans if it were not for limitations imposed by income tax law. Discretionary profit sharing contributions expensed in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $2.5 million, $2.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively. 
​
Multi-employer Bargaining Plans: 
​
The Company contributes to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its bargaining unit employees. Contributions are generally based on amounts paid for union labor or cargo volume. The risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans because assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other 

69




participating employers. Additionally, if one employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.
​
The multi-employer pension plans are subject to the plan termination insurance provisions of ERISA and are paying premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”). The statutes provide that an employer who withdraws from, or significantly reduces its contribution obligation to, a multi-employer plan generally will be required to continue funding its proportional share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s estimated benefit plan withdrawal obligations were $202.9 million. Except as described in Note 12, no withdrawal obligations have been recorded by the Company in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as the Company has no present intention of withdrawing from and does not anticipate termination of any of these plans. 
​
Information regarding the Company’s participation in multi-employer pension plans is outlined in the table below. The “EIN/Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2021 and 2020 is for the plan’s year-end at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded; plans in the orange zone are both a) less than 80 percent funded and b) have an accumulated/expected funding deficiency in any of the next six plan years, net of any amortization extensions; plans in the yellow zone meet either one of the criteria mentioned in the orange zone; and plans in the green zone are at least 80 percent funded. The funding improvement plan (“FIP”) or rehabilitation plan (“RP”) column indicates the status which is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of the collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject.

​
The Company also contributes to multi-employer plans that provide post-retirement health and other benefits other than pensions under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements. Benefits provided to active and retired employees and their eligible dependents under these plans include medical, dental, vision and prescription drug. These plans are not subject to the PBGC plan termination and withdrawal liability provisions of ERISA applicable to multi-employer

defined benefit pension plans. Contributions for these multi-employer postretirement health and other benefits were $34.7 million, $32.5 million and $32.8 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
​
Multi-employer Defined Contribution Plans: The Company contributes to six multi-employer defined contribution pension plans. These plans are not subject to the withdrawal liability provisions of ERISA or the PBGC applicable to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. Contributions made to these plans by the Company were $5.6 million, $5.1 million and $5.3 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

​

12. | MULTI-EMPLOYER WITHDRAWAL LIABILITIES
----+--------------------------------------

​
Horizon ceased all of its operations in Puerto Rico during the first quarter of 2015, which resulted in a mass withdrawal from its multi-employer ILA-PRSSA pension fund. The Company assumed this liability as part of the acquisition of Horizon on May 29, 2015. The Company estimated the mass withdrawal liability based upon the required undiscounted quarterly payment of approximately $1.0 million to be paid to the ILA-PRSSA pension fund over a period which ends in March 2040, discounted to present value using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Future estimated annual payments to be paid to the ILA-PRSSA pension fund as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+-------+-------
Year (in millions) | ​ | Total
2022 | | $ | 4.1 
2023 | ​ | ​ | 4.1

2025 | ​ | ​ | 4.1 
2026 | ​ | ​ | 4.1 
Thereafter | ​ | ​ | 55.5 
Total remaining future undiscounted payments due to the ILA-PRSSA pension fund | ​ | ​ | 76.0

Present value of multi-employer withdrawal liability | ​ | ​ | 54.9 
Current portion of multi-employer withdrawal liability (see Note 2) | ​ | ​ | (4.1) 
Long-term portion of multi-employer withdrawal liability (see Note 2) | | $ | 50.8 

​
Furthermore, the Company assumed a partial withdrawal liability related to the Local 153 Fund of the OPEIU. The partial withdrawal liability resulted from a decline in the number of contribution base units related to the Local 153 Fund caused by Horizon terminating all of its operations in Puerto Rico during the first quarter of 2015. The Company included the partial withdrawal liability of $6.5 million within other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. The Company paid off this liability during 2021.

​
14.EARNINGS PER SHARE
​
Basic earnings per share are determined by dividing net income by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the year. The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of unexercised non-qualified stock options and non-vested stock units. The computation of weighted average dilutive shares outstanding excluded a nominal amount of anti-dilutive non-qualified stock options for each of the years 2021, 2020 and 2019. 
​
The denominators used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:​

15. | SHARE-BASED AWARDS
----+-------------------

​
The Company has share-based compensation plans which are described as follows:​
2016 Incentive Compensation Plan: The Amended and Restated Matson, Inc. 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2016 Plan”) serves as a successor to the 2007 Incentive Compensation Plan and all other predecessor plans. No further grants will be made under the predecessor stock option plans. Under the 2016 Plan, 4.35 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. 
​
The 2016 Plan consists of four separate incentive compensation programs: (i) the discretionary grant program, (ii) the stock issuance program, (iii) the incentive bonus program, and (iv) the automatic grant program for the non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Share-based compensation is generally awarded under three of the four programs, as more fully described below.
​
Discretionary Grant Program — Under the Discretionary Grant Program, stock options may be granted with an exercise price no less than 100 percent of the fair market value (defined as the closing market price) of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. Options generally become exercisable ratably over three years and have a maximum contractual term of 10 years.
​
Stock Issuance Program — Under the Stock Issuance Program, shares of common stock, restricted stock units or performance shares may be granted. Time-based equity awards generally vest ratably over three years. Provided certain three-year performance targets are achieved, performance-based equity awards generally vest on the three-year anniversary date of the grant. 
​
Automatic Grant Program — At each annual shareholder meeting, non-employee directors will receive an award of restricted stock units that entitle the holder to an equivalent number of shares of common stock upon vesting, under the Automatic Grant Program. Awards of restricted stock units granted under the program generally vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.
​
The shares of common stock authorized to be issued under the 2016 Plan may be drawn from shares of the Company’s authorized but unissued common stock or from shares of its common stock that the Company acquires, including shares purchased on the open market or in private transactions.​

​
16.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
​
The Company values its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques for fair value measurements.  Level 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  If the technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.​
The Company uses Level 1 inputs for the fair values of its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and Level 2 inputs for its variable and fixed rate debt.  The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and variable rate debt approximate their carrying values due to the nature of the instruments. The fair value of fixed rate debt is calculated based upon interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company’s existing debt arrangements. 
​

The carrying value and fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:​

17. | COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
----+------------------------------

​
Commitments and contractual obligations, excluding debt obligations (see Note 8), lease commitments (see Note 9), pension and post-retirement plan commitments, and multi-employer bargaining plan withdrawal obligations (see Note 11 and 12), are as follows as of December 31, 2021:​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------------------------------+---+-------+------+--
Commitments and Contractual Obligations (in millions) | | Total | 
Standby letters of credit (1) | ​ | $ | 8.0 | ​
Bonds (2) | ​ | $ | 33.3 | ​
Vendor and other obligations (3) | ​ | $ | 38.4 | ​


(1) | Standby letters of credit are required for the Company’s uninsured workers’ compensation and other insurance programs, and other needs.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Bonds are required for U.S. Customs and other related matters.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Vendor and other obligations include: (i) non-cancellable contractual capital project obligations; (ii) dry-docking related obligations; and (iii) other contractual obligations. Amounts are considered obligations if a contract has been agreed to specifying significant terms of the contract, and the amounts are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
These amounts are not recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and it is not expected that the Company or its subsidiaries will be called upon to advance funds under these commitments.​
Contingencies: Contingencies and other litigation related matters are described as follows:
​
Environmental Matters: The Company’s Ocean Transportation segment has certain risks that could result in expenditures for environmental remediation.
​
On November 10, 2021, the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) issued a Notice of Violation (the “NOV”) to Matson for alleged violations of the Airborne Toxic Control Measure for Auxiliary Diesel Engines Operated on Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth in a California Port pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 17, section 93118.3. CARB regulations require that a company’s fleet plug into shore power for at least 80 percent of visits at California ports and reduce auxiliary engine power generation by at least 80 percent. The NOV alleges that Matson’s fleet did not meet the 80 percent thresholds during visits to the Port of Long Beach in 2020. The violations were alleged to have been incurred by chartered vessels in the CLX+ service. These chartered vessels were not outfitted with alternative maritime power (“AMP”) capability which would have allowed them to plug into the shore power grid and shut down the vessel diesel generators when at dock. The Company has presented mitigating factors for consideration in settlement discussions with CARB, as well as plans to achieve compliance in 2022. Although potential penalties for 2020 and 2021 violations could, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to exceed $1 million, they are not expected to be material to the Company’s business or financial condition.
​

74




Other Matters: The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to, or may be contingently liable in connection with, other legal actions arising in the normal course of their businesses, the outcomes of which, in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel, would not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
