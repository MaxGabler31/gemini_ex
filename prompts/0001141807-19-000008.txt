1ST Constitution Bancorp

1ST Constitution Bancorp is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. 1ST Constitution Bancorp was organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey in February 1999 for the purpose of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding stock of 1ST Constitution Bank (the "Bank") and thereby enabling the Bank to operate within a bank holding company structure. The Company became an active bank holding company on July 1, 1999. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has three employees, all of whom are full-time. The Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Other than its investment in the Bank, the Company currently conducts no other significant business activities.
The main office of the Company and the Bank is located at 2650 Route 130 Cranbury, New Jersey 08512, and the telephone number is (609) 655-4500.

1ST Constitution Bank

The Bank is a commercial bank formed under the laws of the State of New Jersey and engages in the business of commercial and retail banking. As a community bank, the Bank offers a wide range of services (including demand, savings and time deposits and commercial and consumer/installment loans) to individuals, small businesses and not-for-profit organizations principally in the Fort Lee area of Bergen County and in Middlesex, Mercer, Somerset and Monmouth Counties of New Jersey. The Bank conducts its operations through its main office located in Cranbury, New Jersey, and operates 19 additional branch offices in Asbury Park, downtown Cranbury, Fair Haven, Fort Lee, Freehold, Hamilton Square, Hightstown, Hillsborough, Hopewell, Jamesburg, Lawrenceville, Little Silver, Neptune City, Perth Amboy, Plainsboro, Princeton, Rumson, Shrewsbury, and Skillman, New Jersey. The Bank also operates a residential mortgage loan production office in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable legal limits by the FDIC. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 194 employees, of which 189 were full-time employees.

Management efforts focus on positioning the Bank to meet the financial needs of the communities in Middlesex, Mercer, Somerset and Monmouth Counties and the Fort Lee area of Bergen County and to provide financial services to individuals, families, institutions and small businesses. To achieve this goal, the Bank is focusing its efforts on:

•expansion of the Bank;
•personal service; and
•technological advances and e-commerce.
Expansion of the Bank

On April 11, 2018, the Company closed on the merger of New Jersey Community Bank ("NJCB"), a New Jersey-chartered bank, with and into the Bank, with the Bank being the surviving entity (the "NJCB Merger"). At the time of the merger, NJCB had approximately $95 million in assets, approximately $75 million in loans, and approximately $87 million in deposits. NJCB operated two branch offices in Monmouth County, New Jersey which became branches of the Bank as a result of the Merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, dated as of November 6, 2017, governing the Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), each outstanding share of NJCB common stock was exchanged for the right to receive $1.60 in cash and 0.1309 of a share of the Company's common stock. The Company issued 249,785 shares of its common stock, having an aggregate fair value of approximately $5.5 million, and paid cash of approximately $3.1 million, of which approximately $401,000 was placed into escrow under the terms of the Merger Agreement. Cash used as consideration was provided by the Bank from existing cash assets.
The Bank continually evaluates opportunities to expand its products and services to existing and new customers and expand into new markets through the acquisition of other banks and bank offices within and contiguous to its existing markets and/or by opening new branch offices.
Personal Service

The Bank provides a wide range of commercial and consumer banking services to individuals, families, institutions and small businesses in central and coastal New Jersey and the Fort Lee area of Bergen County. The Bank’s focus is to understand the needs 
2

of the community and its customers and tailor products, services and advice to meet those needs. The Bank seeks to provide a high level of personalized banking services, emphasizing quick and flexible responses to customer demands.

Technological Advances and e-Commerce

 The Bank recognizes that customers want to receive service via their most convenient delivery channel, be it the traditional branch office, by telephone, ATM, or the Internet. For this reason, the Bank continues to enhance its e-commerce capabilities. At www.1stconstitution.com, customers have easy access to online banking, including account access, and to the Bank’s bill payment system. Consumers and businesses may also access their accounts and make deposits through their mobile devices.  Consumers can take advantage of Momentum Mortgage, our new digital mortgage platform, to apply online for loans and interact with senior management through the e-mail system. Business customers have access to cash management information and transaction capability through the Bank’s online Cash Manager product which permits business customers to make deposits, originate ACH payments, initiate wire transfers, retrieve account information and place “stop payment” orders. This overall expansion in electronic banking provides the Bank’s customers with the means to access the Bank’s services easily and at their own convenience.

Competition

 The Bank experiences substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in making loans. In attracting deposits and borrowers, the Bank competes with commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loan associations, as well as regional and national insurance companies and non-bank financial institutions, mutual funds, regulated small loan companies and local credit unions, regional and national sponsors of money market funds and corporate and government borrowers.  Within the direct market area of the Bank, there are a significant number of offices of competing financial institutions.  In New Jersey generally, and in the Bank’s local market specifically, the Bank’s most direct competitors are large commercial banks, including Bank of America, PNC Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Santander Bank, as well as savings banks and savings and loan associations, including Provident Bank and Investors Bank.
The Bank is at a competitive disadvantage compared with these larger national and regional commercial and savings banks.  By virtue of their larger capital, asset size and reserves, many of such institutions have substantially greater lending limits (ceilings on the amount of credit a bank may provide to a single customer that are linked to the institution’s capital) and other resources than the Bank. Many such institutions are empowered to offer a wider range of services, including trust services, than the Bank and, in some cases, have lower funding costs (the price a bank must pay for deposits and other borrowed monies used to make loans to customers) than the Bank. In addition to having established deposit bases and loan portfolios, these institutions, particularly large national and regional commercial and savings banks, have the financial ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate considerable resources to locations and products perceived as profitable.

In addition, non-bank financial institutions offer services that compete for customers’ investable funds and deposits with the Bank. For example, brokerage firms and insurance companies offer such instruments as short-term money market funds, corporate and government securities funds, mutual funds and annuities. It is expected that competition in these areas will continue to increase. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and supervision as the Company and the Bank and therefore may be able to offer customers more attractive products than the Bank.

However, management of the Bank believes that loans to small and mid-sized businesses and professionals, which represent the main commercial loan business of the Bank, are not always of primary importance to the larger banking institutions. The Bank competes for this segment of the market by providing responsive personalized services, making timely local decisions, and acquiring in depth knowledge of its customers and their businesses.

Lending Activities

 The Bank’s lending activities include both commercial and consumer loans. Loan originations are derived from a number of sources, including real estate broker referrals, mortgage loan companies, direct solicitation by the Bank’s loan officers, existing depositors and borrowers, builders, attorneys, walk-in customers and, in some instances, other lenders. The Bank has established disciplined and systematic procedures for approving and monitoring loans that vary depending on the size and nature of the loans.
Commercial Business

 The Bank offers a variety of commercial loan services, including term loans, lines of credit, and loans secured by equipment and receivables. A broad range of short-to-medium term commercial loans, both secured and unsecured, are made available to businesses for working capital (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition and development of real estate and improvements), and the purchase of equipment and machinery. Commercial loans are granted based on the 
3

borrower’s ability to generate cash flow to support its debt obligations and other cash related expenses. A borrower’s ability to repay commercial loans is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and on the quality of its management. As a general practice, the Bank takes, as collateral, a security interest in any available real estate, equipment, inventory, receivables or other personal property of its borrowers, although the Bank occasionally makes commercial loans on an unsecured basis. Generally, the Bank requires personal guarantees of its commercial loans to offset the risks associated with such loans. The Bank also offers loans of which a portion, generally 75% to 85%, are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), which is a United States government agency. The Bank generally sells the guaranteed portion of these loans into the secondary market.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate loans are made to businesses to expand their facilities and operations and to real estate operators to finance the acquisition of income producing properties. The Company's loan policy requires that borrowers have sufficient cash flow to meet the debt service requirements and the value of the property meets the loan-to-value criteria set in the loan policy. The Company monitors loan concentrations by borrower, by type of property and by location and other criteria. The Company's commercial real estate portfolio is largely secured by real estate collateral located in the State of New Jersey.
Commercial Construction Financing

Construction financing is provided to businesses to expand their facilities and operations and to real estate developers for the acquisition, development and construction of residential and commercial properties. First mortgage construction loans are made to developers and builders primarily for single family homes or smaller multi-family buildings (less than ten units) that are presold, or are to be sold or leased on a speculative basis. The Bank lends to builders and developers with established relationships, successful operating histories and sound financial resources.
Residential Lending

 A portion of the Bank’s lending activities consists of the origination of fixed and adjustable rate residential first mortgage loans secured by owner-occupied property located in the Bank’s primary market areas. Home mortgage lending is unique in that a broad geographic territory may be serviced by originators working from strategically placed offices either within the Bank’s traditional banking facilities or from affordable office locations in commercial buildings. The Bank also offers construction loans, reverse mortgages, second mortgage home improvement loans and home equity lines of credit.

The Bank finances the construction of individual, owner-occupied single-family houses on the basis of written underwriting and construction loan management guidelines. These loans are made to qualified individual borrowers and are generally supported by a take-out commitment from a permanent lender. The construction phase of these loans has certain risks, including the viability of the contractor, the contractor’s ability to complete the project within the budget and changes in interest rates.

The Bank will generally sell its originated residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The decision to sell is made prior to origination. The sale into the secondary market allows the Bank to mitigate its interest rate risks related to such lending operations. This brokerage arrangement allows the Bank to accommodate its clients’ demands while eliminating the interest rate risk for the 15 to 30-year period generally associated with such loans.

For commercial and residential mortgage loans, the Bank, in most cases, requires borrowers to obtain and maintain title, fire, and extended casualty insurance, and, where required by applicable regulations, flood insurance. The Bank maintains its own errors and omissions insurance policy to protect against loss in the event of failure of a mortgagor to pay premiums on fire and other hazard insurance policies. Mortgage loans originated by the Bank customarily include a "due on sale" clause, which gives the Bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in certain circumstances, including, without limitation, upon the sale or other disposition by the borrower of the real property subject to a mortgage. In general, the Bank enforces "due on sale" clauses.
Non-Residential Consumer Lending

Non-residential consumer loans made by the Bank include loans for automobiles, recreation vehicles, and boats, as well as personal loans (secured and unsecured) and deposit account secured loans. Non-residential consumer loans are attractive to the Bank because they typically have a shorter term and carry higher interest rates than are charged on other types of loans. However, non-residential consumer loans pose an additional risk of collectability when compared to traditional loans, such as residential mortgage loans.

4

Consumer loans are granted based on employment and financial information solicited from prospective borrowers, as well as credit records collected from various reporting agencies.  The stability of the borrower, willingness to pay and credit history are the primary factors to be considered. The availability of collateral is also a factor considered in making such a loan. The Bank seeks collateral that can be assigned and has good marketability with a clearly adequate margin of value. The geographic area of the borrower is another consideration, with preference given to borrowers in the Bank’s primary market areas.

Supervision and Regulation
Banking is a complex, highly-regulated industry. The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy. In furtherance of those goals, Congress has created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted a myriad of legislation that governs banks, bank holding companies and the banking industry. This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the protection of the Company’s shareholders or creditors. Descriptions of, and references to, the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries thereof, and do not purport to be complete. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed.
Regulation of the Bank Holding Company
The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve Board may also make examinations of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is subject to capital standards similar to, but separate from, those applicable to the Bank.
Under the BHCA, bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies generally may not acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any company, including a bank or another bank holding company, without the Federal Reserve Board’s prior approval. The Company has not applied to become a financial holding company but did obtain such approval to acquire the shares of the Bank. A bank holding company that does not qualify as a financial holding company is generally limited in the types of activities in which it may engage to those that the Federal Reserve Board had recognized as permissible for bank holding companies prior to the date of enactment of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. For example, a holding company and its banking subsidiary are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services. At present, the Company does not engage in any significant activity other than owning the Bank.
In addition to federal bank holding company regulation, the Company is registered as a bank holding company with the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the "NJ Banking Department"). The Company is required to file with the NJ Banking Department copies of the reports it files with the federal banking and securities regulators.
Regulation of the Bank Subsidiary
As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to supervision and examination by the NJ Banking Department. The Bank is also subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which is its principal federal bank regulator.
The Bank must comply with various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including the maintenance of reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged thereon, limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the services that may be offered, and restrictions on dividends as described in the below section titled "Restrictions on Dividends and Redemption of Stock for the Company and the Bank." The Bank must also comply with the capital regulations promulgated by the FDIC as described in the section below titled "Capital Adequacy of the Company and the Bank." Consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board which influence the money supply and credit availability in the national economy.
For additional information on laws and regulations affecting the Bank, please refer to the below section titled "Banking Legislation and Regulations."

Capital Adequacy of the Company and the Bank
The Company is required to comply with minimum capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve Board. There are two basic measures of capital adequacy for bank holding companies and the depository institutions that they own: a risk based measure and a leverage measure. All applicable capital standards must be satisfied for a bank holding company to be considered in compliance.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") requires each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risks of non-traditional activities. In addition, pursuant to FDICIA, each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations specifying the levels at which a bank would be considered "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized" and requiring that certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions be taken based on the capital level of the institution.
In December 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, published its “calibrated” capital standards for major banking institutions, referred to as Basel III. Subsequently, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved revisions to their capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules that implemented and addressed the revised standards of Basel III and addressed relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve Board’s and the FDIC’s rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more (which was subsequently increased to $1 billion or more in May 2015), and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (collectively referred to herein as, "banking organizations"). Among other things, the rules established a new Common Equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets). Banking organizations are also required to have a total capital ratio of at least 8% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%. The rules also limit a banking organization’s ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases or pay discretionary bonuses if the banking organization does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The rules became effective for the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to phase-in periods for certain components). The Company and the Bank began phasing in the capital conservation buffer requirement on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and increased by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019 at 2.5% of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. The phase-in period ended on January 1, 2019,
and the Capital Conservation Buffer is now at its fully phased-in level of 2.5%.

With respect to the Bank, the FDIC’s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as "well capitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a Common Equity Tier 1, or CET1, ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as "adequately capitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, and (v) does not meet the definition of "well capitalized." An institution will be classified as "undercapitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as "significantly undercapitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as "critically undercapitalized" if it has a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. Because the capital conservation buffer is now fully phased in, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions will exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.
Under these capital rules, the Bank’s CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage capital ratios were 12.40%, 12.40% ,13.18%, and 11.74%, respectively, at December 31, 2018. The Bank is classified as a non-advanced approaches bank for regulatory purposes and has permanently opted out of including the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income in the computation of regulatory capital.

Restrictions on Dividends and Redemption of Stock for the Company and the Bank
The primary source of cash to pay dividends, if any, to the Company’s shareholders and to meet the Company’s obligations is dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. Dividend payments by the Bank to the Company are subject to the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the "Banking Act") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"). Under the Banking Act, the Bank may not pay dividends unless, following the dividend payment, the capital stock of the Bank will be unimpaired and (i) the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or, if not, (ii) the payment of such dividend will not reduce the surplus of the Bank. Under the FDIA, the Bank may not pay any dividends, if after paying the dividend, it would be undercapitalized under applicable capital requirements. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Bank is also limited in paying dividends if it does not maintain the necessary "capital conservation buffer' as discussed below.
It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the immediately preceding year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. A bank holding company may not pay dividends when it is insolvent. 
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a supervisory letter to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate or defer or severely limit dividends, including, for example, when net income available for shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends. The letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the Federal Reserve Board of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value that results in the net reduction of a bank holding company’s capital at the beginning of the quarter below the capital outstanding at the end of the quarter. The Company’s payment of cash dividends to date were within the guidelines set forth in the Federal Reserve Board’s supervisory letter.
Subsequent to the issuance of the supervisory letter, the Federal Reserve Board adopted regulations requiring bank holding companies to give prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board before purchasing or redeeming its stock if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when aggregated with the net consideration (i.e., gross consideration paid for purchases and redemptions minus gross consideration received for all stock sold) paid for all purchases or redemptions of stock during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. However, if a bank holding company (i) will be well-capitalized before and immediately after the purchase or redemption, (ii) is well-managed and (iii) is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues, then the bank holding company will not be required to give any prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board. At this time, the Company fits within the above exception and is not required to give prior written notice to the Federal Reserve Board before purchasing or redeeming its stock.
The Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy rules also limit a banking organization’s ability to pay dividends or to engage in share repurchases if the banking organization does not hold a "capital conservation buffer" consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. For further discussion of regulatory capital rules, please refer to the discussion under the above section titled "Capital Adequacy of the Company and the Bank." 
The timing and the amount of the payment of future dividends, if any, on the Company's common shares will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will be determined after consideration of various factors, including the level of earnings, cash requirements, regulatory capital and financial condition.
Priority on Liquidation
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The rights of the Company as the sole shareholder of the Bank, and therefore the rights of the Company’s creditors and shareholders, to participate in the distributions and earnings of the Bank when the Bank is not in receivership under Federal banking laws, are subject to various state and federal law restrictions as discussed above under the heading "Restrictions on Dividends and Redemption of Stock for the Company and the Bank." In the event of a liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution such as the Bank, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of an obligation of the institution to its shareholders (the Company) or any shareholder or creditor of the Company. The claims on the Bank by creditors include obligations in respect of federal funds purchased and certain other borrowings, as well as deposit liabilities.

Financial Institution Legislation
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Act has had a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance requirements, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC.
Effective July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Bank does not pay interest on demand deposits. This significant change to existing law has not had an adverse impact on our net interest margin for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are based on average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than on deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act also increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per account owner. However, if an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account ("IOLTA") qualifies for pass-through coverage as a fiduciary account, then each separate client for whom a law firm holds funds in such IOLTA may be insured up to $250,000 for his or her funds. The legislation also increased the required minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund, from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, and directed the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give their shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation ("say on pay") and so-called "golden parachute" payments. It also provides that the listing standards of the national securities exchanges shall require listed companies to implement and disclose "clawback" policies mandating the recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. Such listing standards have yet to be implemented. For further discussion of incentive compensation rules, please refer to the discussion under the below section titled "Incentive Compensation."
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, which authority does not extend to the Bank at this time since we do not meet the asset threshold.
The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable to national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies, which exclude certain instruments that previously have been eligible for inclusion by bank holding companies as Tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities; however, bank holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009 are permitted to include trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010 as Tier 1 capital.
The Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act have impacted the Bank, as well as all community banks, by increasing our operating and compliance costs. To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act remains in place, it is likely to further increase our operating and compliance costs as certain yet to be written implementing rules and regulations are enacted. 
Volcker Rule
On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on July 21, 2015, for investments in covered funds made after December 31, 2013. The 
8

Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from: (i) engaging in "proprietary trading" and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (defined as "Covered Funds") subject to certain limited exceptions. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies.The Company identified no investments that met the definition of Covered Funds and that were required to be divested by July 21, 2015 under the foregoing rules.
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least $1 billion in total assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these agencies must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011 and subsequently proposed revised regulations in May 2016, but the revised regulations have not been finalized. If the revised regulations are adopted in the form proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Company may structure compensation for its executives and employees.
In 2010, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based on the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the "Modernization Act") became effective in early 2000. The Modernization Act:

• | allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies; if a bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company, it files a certification, effective in 30 days, and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals;


• | allows banks to establish subsidiaries to engage in certain activities that a financial holding company could engage in, provided that the bank meets certain management, capital and Community Reinvestment Act standards; and


• | allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks and removes various restrictions applicable to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to financial holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations.

The Modernization Act also amended the BHCA and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application under these acts. The Modernization Act modified other laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment.
Additional proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking and financial services industry are frequently

introduced in Congress, in state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company cannot be determined at this time.
Public Company Legislation
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), which became law on July 30, 2002, added new legal requirements affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporate reporting for companies with publicly traded securities.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides for, among other things:

• | a prohibition on personal loans made or arranged by the issuer to its directors and executive officers (except for loans made by a bank subject to Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board);


• | independence requirements for audit committee members;


• | disclosure of whether at least one member of the audit committee is a "financial expert" (as such term is defined by the SEC and if not, why not;


• | independence requirements for outside auditors;


• | a prohibition on a company’s registered public accounting firm from performing statutorily mandated audit services for the company if the company’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, comptroller, chief accounting officer or any person serving in equivalent positions had been employed by such firm and participated in the audit of such company during the one-year period preceding the audit initiation date;


• | certification of financial statements and annual and quarterly reports by the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer;


• | the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement due to corporate misconduct;


• | disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions;


• | two-business day filing requirements for insiders filing Forms 4;


• | disclosure of a code of ethics for financial officers and filing a Form 8-K for a change or waiver of such code;


• | "real time" filing of periodic reports;


• | posting of certain SEC filings and other information on the company’s website;


• | the reporting of securities violations "up the ladder" by both in-house and outside attorneys;


• | restrictions on the use of non-GAAP financial measures;


• | the formation of a public accounting oversight board; and


• | various increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws.

Additionally, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that a public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), include in its annual report (i) a management’s report on internal control over financial reporting assessing the company’s internal controls, and (ii) if the company is an "accelerated filer" or a "large accelerated filer", an auditor’s attestation report, completed by the registered public accounting firm that prepares or issues an accountant’s report which is included in the company’s annual report, attesting to the effectiveness of management’s internal control assessment. 
The Company met the "accelerated filer" requirements as of the end of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 pursuant to Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. However, pursuant to Rule 12b-2 and SEC Release No. 33-8876, the Company (as a smaller reporting company transitioning to the larger reporting company system) was not required to satisfy the larger reporting company disclosure requirements until its first Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company was further required to include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2018, the SEC increased the public float threshold to be considered a “smaller reporting company” to $250 million from $75 million with respect to the accelerated filer reporting and disclosure requirements. However, the SEC did not change the public float threshold to be considered an “accelerated filer,” which remains $75 million or more, but less than $700 million with respect to the attestation report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company meets the criteria to be both a “smaller reporting company” and an “accelerated filer,” and is therefore required to continue to include the 
10

attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Although the Company satisfies the definition of a “smaller reporting company,” the Company has determined to continue to provide disclosures as an “accelerated filer” that are not required for a "smaller reporting company" for the foreseeable future.
Each of the national stock exchanges, including the Nasdaq Global Market where the Company’s common stock is listed, have in place corporate governance rules, including rules requiring director independence, and the adoption of charters for the nominating, corporate governance, and audit committees. These rules are intended to, among other things, make the board of directors independent of management and allow shareholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors. These burdens increase the Company’s legal and accounting fees and the amount of time that the Board of Directors and management must devote to corporate governance issues.
Section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer to certify that the Company’s Quarterly and Annual Reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Among other things, these officers must certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in the Company’s Quarterly and Annual Reports about their evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and whether there have been significant changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.
Banking Legislation and Regulations

Anti-Money Laundering 
As part of the USA PATRIOT Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the "FATA"). The FATA authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the FATA requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country. In addition, the FATA expands the circumstances under which funds in a bank account may be forfeited and requires covered financial institutions to respond under certain circumstances to requests for information from federal banking agencies within 120 hours.
The Department of Treasury has issued regulations implementing the due diligence requirements. These regulations require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records, encourage cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibit the anonymous use of "concentration accounts," and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program.
Community Reinvestment Act
Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the "CRA"), as implemented by FDIC regulations, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess an institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the applicable institution. The CRA requires public disclosure of an institution’s CRA rating and requires that the FDIC provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. An institution’s CRA rating is considered in determining whether to grant charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. Performance less than satisfactory may be the basis for denying an application. At its last CRA examination, the Bank was rated "satisfactory" under the CRA.

FIRREA
Under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA"), a depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution in danger of default. These provisions have commonly been referred to as FIRREA’s "cross guarantee" provisions. Further, under FIRREA, the failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities.
FIRREA also imposes certain independent appraisal requirements upon a bank’s real estate lending activities and further imposes certain loan-to-value restrictions on a bank’s real estate lending activities. Banking regulators have promulgated regulations in these areas.
Insurance of Deposits
The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. This limit is $250,000 per account owner. FDICIA is applicable to depository institutions and deposit insurance. The FDIC established a risk-based assessment system for all insured depository institutions and established an insurance premium assessment system based upon: (i) the probability that the insurance fund will incur a loss with respect to the institution, (ii) the likely amount of the loss, and (iii) the revenue needs of the insurance fund. The resulting matrix sets the assessment premium for a particular institution in accordance with its capital level and overall rating by the primary regulator.
As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC modified its assessment rules so that an institution’s deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity. These assessment base rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks and up to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV banks. Risk Category II and III banks have assessment base rates ranging from 9 to 33 basis points, respectively. If the risk category of the Bank changes adversely, our FDIC insurance premiums could increase.
Lending Limits
In January 2013, the NJ Banking Department issued an order requiring a New Jersey chartered bank’s calculation of lending limits to any person or entity to include credit exposure to such person or entity arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Previously, such credit exposure was not included in a New Jersey chartered bank’s calculation of lending limits. New Jersey chartered banks must comply with the operative provisions of the order, which include compliance with all of the rules set forth in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s rules on lending limits (codified at 12 C.F.R pts. 32, 159 and 160). This change in the calculation of lending limits did not have a significant impact on the Bank’s operations.
