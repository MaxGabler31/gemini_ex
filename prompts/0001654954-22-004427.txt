ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The following section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally refers to business developments during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. Discussion of, or references to, prior period business developments that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Overview
Blue Dolphin was formed in 1986 as a Delaware corporation. The company is an independent downstream energy company operating in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Operations primarily consist of a light sweet-crude, 15,000-bpd crude distillation tower, and approximately 1.2 million bbls of petroleum storage tank capacity in Nixon, Texas. Blue Dolphin trades on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol “BDCO.”

Assets are organized in two business segments: ‘refinery operations’ (owned by LE) and ‘tolling and terminaling services’ (owned by LRM and NPS). ‘Corporate and other’ includes subsidiaries BDPL (inactive pipeline and facilities assets), BDPC (inactive leasehold interests in oil and gas wells), and BDSC (administrative services). For more information related to our business segments, see “Part I. Item 1. Business—Refinery Operations,—Tolling and Terminaling Operations, and —Inactive Operations” and “Part I. Item 2. Properties” in this report.

Affiliates
Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report. An Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties and funds working capital requirements during periods of working capital deficits. In addition, an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products. Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries are currently parties to a variety of agreements with Affiliates. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (3)” for additional disclosures related to Affiliate agreements, arrangements, and risks associated with working capital deficits.
Going Concern
Management determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. These factors include defaults under secured loan agreements, substantial current debt, margin volatility, historical net losses and working capital deficits. Our consolidated financial statements assume we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty. Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on sustained positive operating margins and adequate working capital for, amongst other requirements, purchasing crude oil and condensate and making payments on long-term debt. If we are unable to process crude oil and condensate into sellable refined products or make required debt payments, we may consider other options. These options could include selling assets, raising additional debt or equity capital, cutting costs, reducing cash requirements, restructuring debt obligations, or filing bankruptcy.
Defaults Under Secured Loan Agreements
As discussed in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report, we are currently in default under certain of our secured loan agreements with third parties and related parties.

Third-Party Defaults

· | Veritex Loans – For the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, principal and interest payments to Veritex were $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. As of the filing date of this report, LE and LRM were in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 for failing to make required monthly principal and interest payments and failing to satisfy financial covenants. In addition, LE was in default under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 for failing to replenish a $1.0 million payment reserve account. Defaults under the LE Term Loan Due 2034 and LRM Term Loan Due 2034 permit Veritex to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights concerning collateral securing obligors’ obligations under these loan agreements, and exercise any other rights and remedies available.

· | Amended Pilot Line of Credit – On October 4, 2021, NPS repaid all obligations owed to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. However, in a letter from NPS to Pilot dated October 28, 2021, NPS disputed approximately $0.3 million in payments NPS believes Pilot misapplied as part of the Amended Pilot Line of Credit setoff. As of the filing date of this report, the amount remained in dispute between the parties. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | From June 2020 to October 2021, Pilot applied payments owed to NPS under two terminal services agreements against NPS’ payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tank lease payment setoff totaled $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The amount of interest NPS incurred under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit totaled $0.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
· | Kissick Debt – Under a 2015 subordination agreement, John Kissick agreed to subordinate his right to payments, as well as any security interest and liens on the Nixon facility’s business assets, in favor of Veritex as holder of the LE Term Loan Due 2034. To date, LE has made no payments under the subordinated Kissick Debt. Mr. Kissick has taken no action due to the non-payment. As of the filing date of this report, defaults under the Kissick Debt related to payment of past due obligations at maturity. 


We can provide no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow will be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our secured loan agreements, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) LE, LRM, and NPS will be able to refinance or restructure the debt, and/or (iii) third parties will provide future default waivers. Defaults under our secured loan agreements and any exercise by third parties of their rights and remedies related to such defaults may have a material adverse effect on the trading prices of our Common Stock and on the value of an investment in our Common Stock, and holders of our Common Stock could lose their investment in our Common Stock in its entirety. Management maintains ongoing dialogue with lenders regarding defaults and potential restructuring and refinance opportunities.

Related-Party Defaults

· | Notes and Loan Agreement – As of the filing date of this report, Blue Dolphin was in default concerning past due payment obligations under the March Carroll Note, March Ingleside Note, and June LEH Note. As of the same date, BDPL was also in default related to past due payment obligations under the BDPL-LEH Loan Agreement. Affiliates controlled approximately 82% of the voting power of our Common Stock as of the filing date of this report, an Affiliate operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties, an Affiliate is a significant customer of our refined products, and we borrow from Affiliates during periods of working capital deficits.

Substantial Current Debt
Excluding accrued interest, we had current debt of $63.0 million and $57.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Current debt consists of bank debt, investor debt, and related party debt. Although the line of credit payable to Pilot fell within current debt during 2021, the Pilot debt was repaid in October 2021. Substantial current debt is primarily the result of secured loan agreements being in default. As a result, these debt obligations were classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Margin Volatility
Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, we must maximize yields of higher value finished petroleum products and minimize costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the spread between these commodity prices decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Although an increase or decrease in the commodity price for crude oil and other feedstocks generally results in a similar increase or decrease in commodity prices for finished petroleum products, typically there is a time lag between the two. The effect of crude oil commodity price changes on our finished petroleum product commodity prices therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully the market adjusts to reflect these changes. Unfavorable margins may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows, and liquidity.

Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted economies around the world, including the oil and gas industry in which we operate. The rapid spread of the virus led to the implementation of various responses, including federal, state, and local government-imposed quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, and other public health and safety measures. Actions by members of OPEC and other producer countries in 2020 concerning oil production and pricing significantly impacted supply and demand in global oil and gas markets, which impacted our operational and financial performance. In particular, we experienced net losses due to unfavorable margins per bbl and significantly lower sales volume due to significant refinery downtime. Global oil prices and refined product demand recovered somewhat in 2021 compared to 2020 as COVID-19 cases stabilized, mortality rates decreased, and availability and inoculation rates of vaccines increased. However, recovery of jet fuel demand lagged that of other refined products as airline travel restrictions and consumer hesitancy to fly during the pandemic continued. Despite the uptick in market conditions during the second half of 2021, overall, we experienced operating and net losses due to unfavorable margins and lower sales volume, which affected our liquidity. Cash constraints adversely impacted the frequency of crude oil acquisition, debt payments, and abandonment of pipeline and facilities assets.

The extent to which the continued COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information that may emerge concerning variants, actions taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 and treat its impact, and the availability and acceptance of vaccines to mitigate such spread, among others.

In February 2022, Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine. The conflict has caused turmoil in global markets, resulting in higher oil prices, and injected even more uncertainty into a worldwide economy recovering from the effects of COVID-19. Given the evolving conflict, there are many unknown factors and events that could materially impact our operations.

The Russian conflict with Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, and the extent to which these events may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend highly on future developments, which are very uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.

Operating Risks
Successful execution of our business strategy depends on several critical factors, including having adequate working capital to meet contractual, operational, regulatory, and safety needs and having favorable margins on refined products. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and prospects will depend highly on future developments, which are very uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.

Management continues to take steps to mitigate risk, avoid business disruptions, manage cash flow, and remain competitive in a volatile commodity price environment. Mitigation steps include: adjusting throughput and production based on market conditions, optimizing receivables and payables by prioritizing payments, optimizing inventory levels based on demand, monitoring discretionary spending, and delaying capital expenditures. To safeguard personnel, we adopted remote working where possible and social distancing, mask-wearing, and other site-specific precautionary measures where on-site operations are required. We also incentivize personnel to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

We can provide no guarantees that: our business strategy will be successful, Affiliates will continue to fund our working capital needs when we experience working capital deficits, we will meet regulatory requirements to provide additional financial assurance (supplemental pipeline bonds) and decommission offshore pipelines and platform assets, we can obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or margins on our refined products will be favorable. Further, if third parties exercise their rights and remedies under our secured loan agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.

Downstream Operations
The refinery operations business segment consists of the following assets and operations:


Property | Key ProductsHandled | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------------------+-------------
Nixon facility· Crude distillation tower (15,000 bpd)· Petroleum storage tanks· Loading and unloading facilities· Land (56 acres) | Crude OilRefined Products | LE | Nixon, Texas

Crude Oil and Condensate Supply. Operation of the Nixon refinery depends on our ability to purchase adequate amounts of crude oil and condensate. We have a long-term crude supply agreement in place with Tartan. The volume-based Crude Supply Agreement expires when we receive 24.8 million net bbls of crude oil. After that, the Crude Supply Agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms (each such term, a renewal term). Either party may provide the other with notice of non-renewal at least 60 days before the expiration of any renewal term. As of December 31, 2021, we received 9.0 million bbls, or 36%, of the contracted total volume under the Crude Supply Agreement.

Pilot and Tartan store jet fuel and crude oil, respectively, at the Nixon facility under two terminal services agreements: (i) a Terminal Services Agreement dated as of May 2019 (covering Tank Nos. 67, 71, 72, 73, 77, and 78) for jet fuel and (ii) a Terminal Services Agreement dated as of June 1, 2019 (covering Tank Nos. 1 and 56) for crude oil. Under both terminal services agreements, Pilot and Tartan store product at the Nixon facility at a specified rate per bbl of the storage tank’s shell capacity.  The terminal services agreements renew on a one-year evergreen basis.  Either party may terminate the terminal services agreements by providing the other party 60 days prior written notice.  The terminal services agreements will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the Crude Supply Agreement.

From June 2020 to October 2021, Pilot applied payments owed to NPS under the above referenced terminal services agreements against NPS’ payment obligations to Pilot under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit. For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the tank lease payment setoff totaled $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

The amount of interest NPS incurred under the Amended Pilot Line of Credit totaled $0.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note (11)” and “Note (17)” to our consolidated financial statements for more information related to the Amended Pilot Line of Credit.

Our financial health has been materially and adversely affected by defaults in our secured loan agreements, substantial current debt, margin volatility, historical net losses and working capital deficits. If Pilot or Tartan terminate the Crude Supply Agreement or terminal services agreements, our ability to acquire crude oil and condensate could be adversely affected. If producers experience crude supply constraints and increased transportation costs, our crude acquisition costs may rise, or we may not receive sufficient amounts to meet our needs. During the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the refinery experienced 23 days and 42 days of downtime, respectively. During the same time periods, 13 days and 20 days, respectively, related to lack of crude associated with cash constraints.

Products and Markets. Our market is the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which the EIA represents as Petroleum Administration for Defense District 3 (PADD 3). We sell our products primarily in the U.S. within PADD 3. We also occasionally sell refined products to customers that export to Mexico.

The Nixon refinery’s product slate is moderately adjusted based on current market demand. We produce a single finished product – jet fuel – and several intermediate products, including naphtha, HOBM, and AGO. We sell our jet fuel to an Affiliate, which is HUBZone certified. The product sales agreement with the Affiliate has a 1-year term expiring upon the earliest to occur of March 31, 2023, plus 30-day carryover or delivery of the maximum quantity of jet fuel. Our intermediate products are primarily sold in nearby markets to wholesalers and refiners as a feedstock for further blending and processing.

Customers. Customers for our refined products include distributors, wholesalers, and refineries primarily in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). We have bulk term contracts in place with most of our customers, including month-to-month, six months, and up to one-year terms. Nearly all of our contracts require customer prepayments and the sale of fixed or minimum quantities of finished and intermediate petroleum products. Many of these arrangements are subject to periodic renegotiation on a forward-looking basis, which could result in higher or lower relative commodity prices on future refined product sales.
Competition. Most of our competitors are significantly larger than us. They have greater access to resources that allow them to compete on a national and international level. In addition, they can respond more quickly to market fluctuations. We compete primarily based on cost. Due to the low complexity of our simple “topping unit” refinery, we can be relatively nimble in adjusting our refined products slate due to shifting commodity prices, market demand, and operating costs.
Safety and Downtime. We operate the refinery in a manner that is materially consistent with industry safety practices and standards. EPA, OSHA, and comparable state and local regulatory agencies provide oversight for personnel safety, process safety management, and risk management to prevent or minimize the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable, or explosive chemicals. Most of our storage tanks are equipped with emissions monitoring devices. We also have response and control plans in place for spill prevention and emergencies.

The Nixon refinery periodically undergoes planned and unplanned temporary shutdowns. We typically complete a planned turnaround annually to repair, restore, refurbish, or replace refinery equipment. Occasionally, unplanned shutdowns occur. Unplanned downtime can occur for a variety of reasons; however, common reasons for unplanned downtime include repair/replacement of disabled equipment, crude deficiencies associated with cash constraints, high temperatures, and power outages. The Nixon refinery did not incur significant damage due to Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021. However, the facility lost external power for 10 days due to the storm.

We are particularly vulnerable to operation disruptions because all our refining operations occur at a single facility. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime results in lost margin opportunity, reduced refined products inventory, and potential increased maintenance expense, all of which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.

Midstream Operations
The tolling and terminaling business segment consists of the following assets and operations:


Property | Key ProductsHandled | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------------------+-------------
Nixon facility· Petroleum storage tanks· Loading and unloading facilities | Crude OilRefined Products | LRM, NPS | Nixon, Texas

Products and Customers. The Nixon facility’s petroleum storage tanks and infrastructure are primarily suited for crude oil and condensate and refined products, such as naphtha, jet fuel, diesel, and fuel oil. Storage customers are typically refiners in the lower portion of the Texas Triangle (the Houston - San Antonio - Dallas/Fort Worth area). Shipments are received and redelivered from within the Nixon facility via pipeline or from third parties via truck. Contract terms range from month to month to three years.
Operations Safety. Our midstream operations are conducted in a manner materially consistent with industry safety practices and standards. EPA, OSHA, and comparable state and local agencies provide regulatory oversight. We have the appropriate emergency response and spill prevention and control plans in place.
Inactive Operations
We own other pipeline and facilities assets and have leasehold interests in oil and gas properties. These assets are inactive. We account for these inactive operations in ‘corporate and other.’ We fully impaired our pipeline assets in 2016 and our oil and gas leasehold interests in 2011. Our pipeline assets and oil and gas leasehold interests had no revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Property | Operating Subsidiary | Location 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------
Freeport facility· Crude oil and natural gas separation and dehydration· Natural gas processing, treating, and redelivery· Vapor recovery unit· Two onshore pipelines· Land (162 acres) | BDPL | Freeport, Texas
Offshore Pipelines (Trunk Line and Lateral Lines) | BDPL | Gulf of Mexico 
Oil and Gas Leasehold Interests | BDPC | Gulf of Mexico 

Pipeline and Facilities Safety. 
Although our pipeline and facility assets are inactive, they require upkeep and maintenance. They are also subject to safety requirements under PHMSA, BOEM, BSEE, and comparable state and local regulations. We have response and control plans, spill prevention, and other programs to respond to emergencies related to these assets.
Insurance and Risk Management
Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in crude oil and condensate refining operations, as well as the transportation and storage of crude oil and condensate and refined products. We have property damage, business interruption, and pollution liability coverages at the Nixon facility. Business interruption coverage is for 24 months from the date of the loss, subject to a deductible with a 45-day waiting period. Pollution liability provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commences at a specific day and time during the policy period. The pollution policy is subject to a retention and deductible and contains discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions, and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim. As a result, there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.

Additional coverage includes umbrella, excess liability, workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability, environmental liability, and other business risks. These coverages are supported by safety and other risk management programs. Our insurance program may not cover all operational risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a claim. We do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Losses in excess of our insurance coverage or cancellation of policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Intellectual Property
We rely on intellectual property laws to protect our brand, as well as those of our subsidiaries. “Blue Dolphin Energy Company” is a registered trademark in the U.S. in name and logo form. “Petroport, Inc.” is a registered trademark in the U.S. in name form. In addition, “www.blue-dolphin-energy.com” is a registered domain name.
Website Access to Reports and Other Information
We make certain filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments and exhibits to those reports, which are available free of charge through the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov) or through our website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com), as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the SEC. We have also posted our Code of Business Ethics, board committee charters and other corporate governance documents on our website. Our website and the information contained on that site, or connected to that site, are not incorporated by reference into this report.
Human Capital Management
General. Our operations and activities are managed by an Affiliate. We do not have any employees. As of December 31, 2021, 89 employees of the Affiliate provided support for our operations pursuant to the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. None of these employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Under the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, the Affiliate operates and manages all of our properties.
Safety, Health, and Wellness. We must comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety that protect the health and safety of our workforce. We operate a safety and health program with participation by personnel at all levels of the organization. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities.

We have developed and implemented a COVID-19 mitigation plan based on CDC and state health guidelines. This plan includes the implementation of health-screening protocols, elevated cleaning measures, reduced shared spaces, the purchase of masks for all personnel for use when social-distancing measures are not possible, and providing work-from-home support to facilitate remote working. Although vaccines have not been mandated, we have actively communicated updates to our workforce regarding vaccine availability and have encouraged eligible personnel to get vaccinated.

Inclusion and Diversity. We are evaluating measures to put in place that track our progress with regard to diversity and inclusion. 

Government Regulations
General. Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, and local laws, regulations, permits, and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern obtaining and maintaining construction and operating permits, the emission and discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air, and water, the handling and disposal of solid, liquid, and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate, and upgrade equipment and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil, and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. These requirements may also significantly affect our customers’ operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. However, we do not expect such effects will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.
Air Emissions and Climate Change Regulations. Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local statutes. Under these laws, we are required to obtain permits, as well as test, monitor, report, and implement control requirements. If regulations become more stringent, additional emission control technologies may be required to be installed at the Nixon facility and certain emission sources located offshore, and our ability to secure future permits may become less certain. Any such future obligations could require us to incur significant additional capital or operating costs.

The EPA has undertaken significant regulatory initiatives under authority of the Clean Air Act’s NSR/PSD program to further reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These regulatory initiatives have been targeted at industries with large manufacturing facilities that are significant sources of emissions, such as refining, paper and pulp, and electric power generating industries. The basic premise of these initiatives is the EPA’s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with NSR/PSD regulations, which result in emission increases above threshold limits. As part of this ongoing NSR/PSD regulatory initiative, the EPA has consent decrees with several refiners that require refiners to make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities. We are not under a consent decree. If selected, as a small refiner we do not expect any additional requirements to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

The EPA strengthened the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion in 2015 from the 75-parts per billion level set in 2008. To implement the revised ozone NAAQS, all states will need to review their existing air quality management infrastructure State Implementation Plan for ozone and ensure it is appropriate and adequate. Where areas remain in ozone non-attainment or come into ozone non-attainment as a result of the revised NAAQS, it is likely that additional planning and control obligations will be required. States may impose additional emissions control requirements on stationary sources, changes in fuels specifications, and changes in fuels mix and mobile source emissions controls. The ongoing and potential future requirements imposed by states to meet the ozone NAAQS could have direct impacts on terminaling facilities through additional requirements and increased permitting costs and could have indirect impacts through changing or decreasing fuel demand.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 created RFS2 requiring the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. The EPA granted the Nixon refinery a small refinery exemption from RFS2 requirements for 2013 and 2014. Since 2014, the Nixon refinery has solely produced HOBM, a non-transportation lubricant blend product that does not fall under RFS2.

Currently, multiple legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation. These include actions to develop national, state, or regional programs, each of which would require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions or those of our customers. In 2015, the EPA amended the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems source category (Subpart W) of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, to include among other things a new Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting segment that encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from equipment and sources within the petroleum and natural gas gathering boosting systems. In 2016, the EPA promulgated regulations regarding performance standards for methane emissions from new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities, and in September 2018, proposed targeted improvements to these standards to streamline implementation of the rules. These and other legislative regulatory measures will impose additional burdens on our business and those of our customers.

Hazardous Substances and Waste Regulations. The CERCLA imposes strict, joint and several liability on a broad group of potentially responsible parties for response actions necessary to address a release of hazardous substances into the environment. The law authorizes two kinds of response actions: (i) short-term removals, where actions may be taken to address releases or threatened releases requiring prompt response, and (ii) long-term remedial response actions, that permanently and significantly reduce the dangers associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances that are serious, but not immediately life threatening. Neither we nor any of our predecessors have been designated as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute.

We generate petroleum product wastes, solid wastes, and ordinary industrial wastes, such as from paints and solvents, that are regulated under RCRA and comparable state statues. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements because we are considered small quantity generators of hazardous wastes by the EPA and state regulations. However, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. The Hazardous Waste Generator Improvement Rule of the EPA provides some additional flexibility for small generators but also increases certain recordkeeping and administrative burdens. Several states are now in the process of adopting this rule. Any additional changes in the regulations could increase our capital and operating costs. 

We currently own properties where crude oil, refined petroleum hydrocarbons, and fuel additives have been handled for many years by previous owners. At some facilities, hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. Although prior owners and operators may have used operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, these properties and wastes disposed thereon are now subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed or released wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including impacted groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination to the extent we are not indemnified for such matters.

Water Pollution Regulations. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including chemical components of crude oil and refined products, into federal and state waters. The CWA prohibits the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters except as authorized by the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or a state agency with delegated authority. The transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risks and subjects us to the provisions of the CWA, OPA 90, and related state requirements.

Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements mandate the use of structures, such as berms and other secondary containment, to prevent hydrocarbons or other pollutants from reaching a jurisdictional body of water in the event of a spill or leak. These requirements prevent pollutant releases and minimize potential impacts should a release occur. We have federally certified OSROs available to respond to a spill and, in the case of our offshore pipelines, we maintain the statutory $35.0 million coverage required proof of financial responsibility. In the event of an oil spill into navigable waters, we can be subject to strict, joint, and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences.

Wastewater is subject to restrictions and strict controls under the CWA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits. Process wastewater from the Nixon refinery is tested and discharged to a nearby municipal treatment facility pursuant to applicable process wastewater permits. Wastewater from our offshore facilities, including our oil and natural gas pipelines and anchor platform, is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable produced water permits. Stormwater at the Nixon facility is tested and discharged pursuant to applicable stormwater permits.

Offshore “Idle Iron” Decommissioning Regulations. In 2018 BSEE updated its earlier 2010 guidance and regulations on decommissioning that mandates lessees and rights-of-way holders permanently abandon and/or remove platforms and other structures when no longer useful for operations. To cover the various obligations of lessees and rights-of-way holders operating in federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico, BOEM evaluates an operator’s financial ability to carry out present and future obligations to determine whether the operator must provide additional security beyond the minimum bonding requirements. Such obligations include the cost of plugging and abandoning wells and decommissioning and removing platforms and pipelines at the end of production or service activities. Once plugging and abandonment work has been completed, the collateral backing the financial assurance is released by BOEM. 

We are required by BOEM to: (i) maintain acceptable financial assurance (pipeline bonds) for the decommissioning of our assets offshore in federal waters and (ii) decommission these assets following a certain period of inactivity. As of December 31, 2021, we maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed pipeline rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, BDPL maintained $3.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in AROs related to abandonment of these assets. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional disclosures related to idle iron decommissioning requirements for our pipelines and facilities assets and related risks.
