ITEM 1.             BUSINESS 
General 
 Live Current Media, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 10, 1995. The Company has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of common stock with 34,837,625 shares currently issued and outstanding. 
 The Company operates its business through its wholly owned subsidiary, Domain Holdings Inc., originally formed under the laws of British Columbia, Canada on July 4, 1994 and re-domiciled to Alberta, Canada on April 14, 1999 (DHI). The Company is also the majority shareholder of Perfume, Inc. (95% ownership), formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 13, 2008. Perfume, Inc. is currently dormant and does not carry on an active business. References herein to the Company include DHI and Perfume, Inc. (collectively, the Subsidiaries) unless otherwise stated. 
 On March 21, 2019, the Company executed a distribution agreement (the Distribution Agreement) with Cell MedX Corp. (Cell MedX or the Device Manufacturer), pursuant to which Cell MedX granted to the Company exclusive worldwide rights to distribute the eBalance microcurrent device to households and individual users. Although the Company does not currently intend to abandon its domain name and website development business, the Company expects to devote the majority of its near-term business efforts to selling and distributing the eBalance device. 
 On June 4, 2014, pursuant to an arbitration award issued as part of certain legal proceedings among the Company, former executives and directors of the Company and certain shareholders of the Company (including David M. Jeffs, the Companys current Chief Executive Officer), the District Court for Washoe County, Nevada ordered a receiver to be appointed and to take charge of the Companys assets. The Company operated throughout 2015 and 2016 under receivership. On January 11, 2017, the District Court in Washoe County entered an order terminating the receivers possession of assets of the Company resulting in operations of the Company being returned to the directors of the Company. On May 4, 2017, the District Court in Washoe County discharged the Company from receivership.
 Domain Name and Website Development Business 
 The Companys sole business currently is that of managing the business of DHI. DHI is in the business of utilizing its exclusive ownership of domain names to develop internet-related business ventures.
 Online Business Development. The Company, through DHI, holds title to a portfolio of approximately one hundred (100) intuitive, generic domains, such as Rodeo.com, Electronic.com, Boxing.com and Number.com, which inherently attract a stream of online visitors. The Company is not actively seeking to acquire additional domain names at this time. However, the Company will evaluate future opportunities to acquire additional domain names as they present themselves. The Company seeks opportunities to use its domain name rights to develop online businesses, by itself and through alliances with other entities. The Company believes that its operating businesses can share common platforms and infrastructure helping to create a scalable, adaptable and efficient growth model, while also capitalizing on the generic domain names ability to intuitively attract customers. The Company also believes it may be able to create economies of scale with each new business it develops. The Companys business model for these operating businesses includes multiple revenue streams via revenue-sharing, leasing, web-advertising and trading of domain names. The Company has not, to date, capitalized on this plan in any significant manner. 
 Joint Ventures and Participations. The Company believes that its inventory of generic domain names may be attractive to established non-Internet businesses that are leaders or near-leaders in their respective industries. The Companys business plan focuses on offering a long-term, strategic partnership in exchange for commitments that could include cash, marketing exposure, access to limited products, and business development activities. Similarly, the Company seeks to identify end-consumers who purchase the products and services that complement the businesses utilizing the Companys inventory of domain names. Since 2000, the Company has implemented its business plan by entering into arrangements pursuant to which the Company has leased or licensed rights to utilize generic domain names owned by the Company to existing entities in return for cash payments and, in some cases, an equity participation in the entity or a joint venture established to exploit the name. Currently, the Company has two websites, Boxing.com and Number.com, that operate under a verbal joint venture arrangement with a third-party web developer (the Web Developer). Under this arrangement, the Company owns the domain names and the Web Developer develops and operates the websites at the Web Developers own cost and expense. The terms of the arrangement call for the Company and the Web Developer to split gross advertising revenues from the websites and the proceeds of any sale of the websites. However, advertising revenues for Boxing.com and Number.com have been minimal. As such, the Company has permitted the Web Developer to retain advertising revenues to offset against the costs of operating those websites. A description of the terms of the Companys verbal arrangement with the Web Developer is attached as Exhibit 10-1 to this registration statement. Boxing.com is a news and media site offering users the opportunity to read daily news and statistics relating to the boxing and fight industry and is focused on becoming the most used site for boxing enthusiasts online. Number.com is a US directory of businesses.

The Company expects to continue to seek additional opportunities utilizing its domain names; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to locate such opportunities, or if located, it will be able to enter into arrangements with such entities. 
 Sale and Lease of Domain Names. The Company recognizes opportunities which arise to monetize its ownership of domain names by selling or leasing the domain names, which may be more valuable than the exploitation of the ownership value of the names. The Company has previously sought opportunities to sell all or a portion of the domain names it holds in one or a series of transactions. Through these efforts, the Company has determined that by selling the domain names individually rather than as a portfolio the Company will maximize the revenue potential of these assets. The Company continues to market its individual and portfolio of domain names using third party brokers. The Company will continue to evaluate any offers received. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Companys only source of income was from the sale of domain names. 
 The Company is also actively seeking opportunities to lease its domain names to companies who want to benefit from the availability of advertising and internet traffic that is generated by generic domain names. 
 Advertising Revenues. Historically, the Company generated revenue from advertising. However, advertising revenue has declined significantly over the years due to changes in the advertising model. The Company will continue to seek advertising revenue opportunities but does not expect that advertising will ever again represent a significant revenue source for the Company. 
 Distribution of Cell MedX eBalance Devices
On March 21, 2019, the Company executed the Distribution Agreement with Cell MedX, pursuant to which Cell MedX has granted to the Company an exclusive worldwide license to distribute its eBalance microcurrent device to households and individual users. To acquire these rights, the Company paid to Cell MedX the sum of $250,000, the full amount of which was paid to Cell MedX upon signing of the letter of intent between the Company and Cell MedX in September 2018. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company has agreed to pay to Cell MedX a fee (the License Fee) for each eBalance device sold. In addition, the users of the eBalance device will be charged a periodic user fee (the User Fee) that will be split between the Company and Cell MedX. To maintain its exclusive distribution rights, the Company is subject to minimum sales and, after a period of time, minimum User Fee, requirements. If the Company fails to meet the minimum sales requirements, the Company will maintain its distribution rights, however those rights will cease to be exclusive. 
 eBalance Technology
The eBalance microcurrent device is based on the Device Manufacturers proprietary technology (the eBalance Technology) founded on the science of bioelectric signals, their affect on epigenetic events within the human body, and ability to modify and affect the behavior of cells, tissue, and organs. Based on this technology the Device Manufacturer is developing a radically different and very promising family of devices whose core technology demarcates it from the approaches currently in use and those in the future advances pipeline as reflected in current medical literature. 
 Microcurrent delivery devices used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and poor wound healing in diabetics have been in the marketplace for decades. However, the eBalance Technology can be distinguished from those devices, which have a limited utility and are not designed to treat diabetes at its. Not a me too device, nor an incremental improvement in an established realm, devices based on the eBalance Technology could, if proven through diligent research and development, open a new category of diabetes care. 
 The eBalance Technology is intended to expand the traditional healthcare model of managing diabetes, high blood pressure, Parkinsons as well as some other pathological diseases, by enabling patients to manage their symptoms using a biosignal generating device that is simple to use, causes no discomfort, and can easily be incorporated into any lifestyle. 
 It is expected that the eBalance Technology will form the basis for a product line that will be available to aid in the management of diabetes mellitus (both Type 1 and Type 2), its complications, high blood pressure and some other pathologies, both as a professional clinic-based device and as a home use device. 
 Page 6 of 26 

A research and development plan adopted by the Device Manufacturer includes a series of investigations that are intended to move the product from a prototype stage through a series of refinements and enhancements to achieve the safety and efficacy objectives of the device(s) upon which a set of claims intended for FDA, Health Canada and European Medical CE approval through the rigorous Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process is being constructed. A clinical observational trial finalized during 2017 (the Clinical Study), and future planned clinical trials will dictate the final marketing claims for the eBalance products, and will become the foundation for sales & marketing efforts in subsequent phases. The results of the Clinical Study and in-house observations of the effects of the eBalance technology on the human body, suggested that claims should not only focus on overall diabetes management, reductions in average blood sugar (HbA1C) as well as other markers that denote the degree and quality of blood sugar control, but can also encompass pain management, blood pressure control, and alleviation of symptoms associated with Parkinsons disease. 
 Given the size of the market for diabetes control and management, the current eBalance Technology has significant potential for success based solely on treating complications caused by diabetes. However, in order to capture a larger market share, the Device Manufacturer is looking into developing more specialized treatment options to target other ailments such as gout, hypertension, heart disease, neurological disorders, and depression. 
 Marketing of the eBalance
The Companys marketing efforts for the eBalance will initially target the 10 million Americans aged 65 and older who have diabetes directly through a combination of advertising on internet platforms such as Facebook, active participation in social media, a dedicated YouTube channel, attendance at major health and wellness expositions and direct marketing to doctors, corporations and assisted living communities. 
 ITEM1A.           RISK FACTORS 
 An investment in the Companys common shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this registration statement before investing in its common shares. If any of the following risks occur, the Companys business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The trading price of its common shares could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 
 You should consider each of the following risk factors and the other information in this registration statement, including the Companys financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating its business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact on the Companys business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently consider immaterial may also impair its business operations. If any of the following risks do occur, its business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of its common stock could decline. 
 Risks Associated with the Companys Domain Name and Website Development Business 
 Effect of Existing Governmental Regulation. The Companys services are subject to significant regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulation or regulatory requirements may have a negative impact upon the Company and its business. 
 Licensing. Currently, other than business and operations licenses applicable to most commercial ventures, the Company is not required to obtain any governmental approval for its business operations, although the Company applies to ICANN and its contractors to obtain and maintain its domain name assets. There can be no assurance, however, that governmental institutions will not, in the future, impose licensing or other requirements on the Company. Additionally, as noted below, there are a variety of laws and regulations that may, directly or indirectly, have an impact on the Companys business. 
 Privacy Legislation and Regulations. While the Company is not currently subject to licensing requirements, entities engaged in operations over the Internet, particularly relating to the collection of user information, are subject to limitations on their ability to utilize such information under federal and state legislation and regulation. In 2000, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act required that the collection of identifiable information regarding users of financial services be subject to stringent disclosure and opt-out provisions. While this law and the regulations enacted by the Federal Trade Commission and others relates primarily to information relating to financial transactions and financial institutions, the broad definitions of those terms may make the businesses entered into by the Company and its strategic partners subject to the provisions of the Act. This, in turn, may increase the cost of doing business and make it unattractive to collect and transfer information regarding users of services. This, in turn, may reduce the revenues of the Company and its strategic partners, thus reducing potential revenues and profitability. Similarly, the Children On-line Privacy and Protection Act (COPPA) imposes strict limitations on the ability of Internet ventures to collect information from minors. The impact of COPPA may be to increase the cost of doing business on the Internet and reducing potential revenue sources. The Company may also be impacted by the US Patriot Act, which requires certain companies to collect and provide information to United States governmental authorities. A number of state governments have also proposed or enacted privacy legislation that reflects or, in some cases, extends the limitations imposed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and COPPA. These laws may further impact the cost of doing business on the Internet and the attractiveness of Live Currents inventory of domain names.

Advertising Regulations. In response to concerns regarding spam (unsolicited electronic messages), pop-up web pages and other Internet advertising, the federal government and a number of states have adopted or proposed laws and regulations which would limit the use of unsolicited Internet advertisements. While a number of factors may prevent the effectiveness of such laws and regulations, the cumulative effect may be to limit the attractiveness of effecting sales on the Internet, thus reducing the value of the Companys inventory of domain names. 
 There are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the Internet. However, laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that address issues such as user privacy, pricing and the characteristics and quality of products and services. For example, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 sought to prohibit transmitting various types of information and content over the Internet. Several telecommunications companies have petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to regulate Internet service providers and on-line service providers in a manner similar to long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on those companies. This could increase the cost of transmitting data over the Internet. Moreover, it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership, libel and personal privacy are applicable to the Internet. Any new laws or regulations relating to the Internet or any new interpretations of existing laws could have a negative impact on Live Currents business and add additional costs to doing business on the Internet. 
 Effect of new root domain names. The Companys business is subject to a number of risks. In addition to competitive risks, the Company is engaged in businesses that are not currently profitable, and there can be no assurance that the Companys business strategy will ever lead to profits. Moreover, the Company relies upon an inventory of generic domain names for lease, sale, and other ventures, which are made up mostly of .com suffixes. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has introduced the introduction of additional new domain name suffixes, which may be as or more attractive than the .com domain name suffix. New root domain names may have the effect of allowing the entrance of new competitors at limited cost, which may further reduce the value of the Companys domain name assets. The Company does not presently intend to acquire domain names using newly authorized root domain names to match its existing domain names, although the Company has certain .cn (China) root domain names to complement its growth strategy. 
 Competition. The Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities than itself in the B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) market as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. In addition, while the Company holds title to a wide variety of generic names that may prove valuable, many of the Companys competitors have a very diverse portfolio of names and have not confined their market to one industry, product or service, but offer a wide array of multi-layered businesses consisting of many different customer and industry partners. Some of these competitors have been in business for longer than the Company and may have established more strategic partnerships and relationships than the Company. In addition, as noted above, ICANN regularly develops new domain name suffixes that will have the result of making a number of domain names available in different formats, many of which may be more attractive than the formats held by the Company. 
 New Products and Services. The Company seeks to develop a portfolio of operating businesses either by itself or by entering into arrangements with businesses that operate in the product or service categories that are described by the domain name assets owned by DHI. The Company has not, however, identified specific business opportunities other than Boxing.com and Number.com at this point and there can be no assurance that it will do so. 
 Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers. The Company does not currently depend on any single customer for a significant proportion of its business. However, as the Company enters into strategic transactions, the Company may choose to grant exclusive rights to a small number of parties or otherwise limit its activities that could, in turn, create such dependence. The Company, however, has no current plans to do so. 
 Page 8 of 26 


Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights. On November 16, 2007, The Company filed a trademark application with the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) for the mark "LIVE CURRENT". A certificate of registration was issued on October 14, 2008 and the mark was assigned registration number 3,517,876. 
 The Company will consider seeking further trademark protection for its online businesses and the associated domain names, however, the Company may be unable to avail itself of trademark protection under United States laws because, among other things, the names are generic and intuitive. Consequently, the Company will seek trademark protection only where it has determined that the cost of obtaining protection, and the scope of protection provided, results in a meaningful benefit to the Company. 
 Risks Related to the Companys eBalance Distribution Business
Competitive Marketplace for Medical and Wellness Devices. The eBalance device operates in a highly competitive market. eBalance devices will face competition from devices manufactured and marketed by large, well established medical and wellness device manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in the market for treating and managing diabetes and related ailments. Many of these companies and their devices are very well accepted by health practitioners and have significant resources, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively. 
 The market for treatment and management of diabetes and related ailments is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. The eBalance device competes indirectly with large pharmaceutical and medical device companies, such as Bayer Corp., Becton Dickinson Corp., LifeScan Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson, the MediSense Inc. and TheraSense Inc. These competitors products are based on traditional healthcare model and are well accepted by health practitioners and patients. If these companies decide to penetrate the target market for the eBalance device, they could threaten threaten the Companys ability to market and distribute the eBalance device. 
 Developing Technology with Numerous Governmental Regulations. The eBalance device will be subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, the eBalance products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs. In addition, no assurance can be given that the eBalance device will remain in compliance with applicable FDA, Health Canada and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. 
 Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect our business. A number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and its amendments changed access to health care products and services and established new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The Company cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking. 
 Inability of Cell MedX to protect and enforce intellectual property rights. As a distributor of the eBalance device, the Company is reliant on the intellectual property rights of Cell MedX to its technology. If Cell MedX is unable to defend, protect and enforce its intellectual property rights, the Companys ability to distribute eBalance devices could adversely be affected. In addition, an adverse outcome in any litigation or interference proceeding could subject the Company to significant liabilities to third parties and require the Company to cease distributing eBalance devices. In addition, a finding that any of Cell MedXs intellectual property rights are invalid could allow competitors to more easily and cost-effectively develop and manufacture competing devices. Thus, an unfavorable outcome in any patent litigation or interference proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the Companys future business prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 
 eBalance Device is Unproven. The eBalance device is a new product to the health, wellness and medical device space, and a commercial market has not yet developed. The Companys future success will depend on its ability to work with Cell MedX to develop a market for the eBalance device and to gain commercial acceptance of the eBalance device and the eBalance Technology. 
 Lack of Operating History in Marketplace. The Company does not have any operating history or experience in the distribution of medical or wellness devices. A lack of experience in this marketplace could make it more difficult for the Company to compete. In addition, the Companys lack of experience in this space makes it difficult to assess or estimate its future potential. Success has yet to be proven and financial losses should be expected to continue in the near future.   Page 9 of 26 


Risks Related to the Companys Securities 
 The Companys stock price is volatile. The stock markets in general, and the stock prices of internet companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of the Companys Common Stock is likely to fluctuate in the future, especially if the Companys Common Stock is thinly traded. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of the Companys Common Stock include: 

(a) | actual or anticipated variations in the Companys results of operations; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | the Companys ability or inability to generate new revenues; 
(c) | increased competition; 
(d) | government regulations, including internet regulations; 
(e) | conditions and trends in the internet industry; 
(f) | proprietary rights; or 
(g) | rumors or allegations regarding the Companys financial disclosures or practices. 

 The Companys stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or disproportionate to its operating performance. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Companys Common Stock. 
 The Company does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company has never paid cash dividends on its Common Stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company intends to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand its business. 
 Penny Stock rules may make buying or selling the Companys Common Stock difficult, and severely limit its market and liquidity. Trading in The Companys Common Stock is subject to certain regulations adopted by the SEC commonly known as the penny stock rules. The Companys Common Stock qualifies as penny stocks and are covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell the Common Stock in the aftermarket. The penny stock rules govern how broker-dealers can deal with their clients and penny stocks. For sales of The Companys Common Stock, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from you a written agreement prior to making a sale to you. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by the penny stock rules may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in The Companys Common Stock, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of its Common Stock. This could prevent you from reselling your shares and may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline. 
 Lack of operating revenues. The Company has limited operating revenues and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Management has assessed the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and the financial statements included with this registration statement includes disclosure that there is a substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The audit report of the Companys principal independent accountants for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 includes a statement regarding the uncertainty of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys failure to achieve profitability and positive operating revenues could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations, and could cause the Companys business to fail. 
 No assurance that forward-looking assessments will be realized. The Companys ability to accomplish their objectives and whether or not they are financially successful is dependent upon numerous factors, each of which could have a material effect on the results obtained. Some of these factors are in the discretion and control of management and others are beyond managements control. The assumptions and hypotheses used in preparing any forward-looking assessments contained herein are considered reasonable by management. There can be no assurance, however, that any projections or assessments contained herein or otherwise made by management will be realized or achieved at any level.
