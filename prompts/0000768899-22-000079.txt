Item 1. | BUSINESS

OUR COMPANY
TrueBlue, Inc. (the “company,” “TrueBlue,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help clients achieve business growth and improve productivity. We began operations in 1989 and are headquartered in Tacoma, Washington.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
In 2021, we connected approximately 615,000 people with work and served approximately 95,000 clients. Our operations are managed as three business segments: PeopleReady, PeopleManagement and PeopleScout.
•PeopleReady offers general, industrial and skilled trade staffing throughout the United States of America (“U.S.”), Canada and Puerto Rico.
•PeopleManagement offers contingent, on-site industrial staffing and commercial driver services throughout the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.
•PeopleScout offers recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”) and managed service provider (“MSP”) solutions to a wide variety of industries, primarily in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia.
PeopleReady provides access to qualified associates through a wide range of staffing solutions for on-demand contingent general and skilled labor. PeopleReady connects people with work in a broad range of industries that include construction, manufacturing and logistics, warehousing and distribution, retail, waste and recycling, energy, hospitality and general labor.
PeopleReady helped approximately 94,000 clients in fiscal 2021 be flexible and more productive by providing easy access to dependable, contingent labor. Through our PeopleReady business segment, we connected approximately 220,000 people with work in fiscal 2021. We have a network of 619 branches across all 50 states in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Augmenting our branch network is our industry-leading mobile app, JobStackTM, which connects people with work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. JobStack creates a virtual exchange between our associates and clients, and allows our branch resources to expand their recruiting, sales and service delivery efforts. JobStack is competitively differentiating our services, expanding our reach into new demographics, and improving our service delivery and work order fill rates, as we continue to execute our digital strategy.

PeopleManagement provides recruitment and on-site management of a facility’s contingent industrial workforce. Through this business segment, we connected approximately 60,000 people with work in fiscal 2021. In comparison with PeopleReady, services are larger in scale and longer in duration, and dedicated service teams are located at the client’s facility. We provide scalable solutions to meet the volume requirements of labor-intensive manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Our dedicated service teams work closely with on-site management as an integral part of the production and logistics process, managing all or a subset of the contingent labor for a facility or operational function. Our on-site staffing solutions provide large-scale sourcing, screening, recruiting and management of the contingent workforce at a client’s facility in order to achieve faster hiring, lower total workforce cost, increase safety and compliance, improve retention, create greater volume flexibility, and enhance strategic decision-making through robust reporting and analytics. Our On-Site business includes our Staff Management | SMX (“Staff Management”) and SIMOS Insourcing Solutions (“SIMOS”) branded service offerings, which provide hourly and productivity-based (cost per unit) pricing options for industrial staffing solutions. Client contracts are generally multi-year in duration. The productivity-based pricing leverages a strategically engineered on-site solution to incentivize performance improvements in cost, quality and on-time delivery using a fixed price-per-unit approach. Both hourly and productivity-based pricing are impacted by factors such as geography, volume, job type and degree of recruiting difficulty.
PeopleManagement also provides dedicated and contingent commercial truck drivers to the transportation and distribution industries through our Centerline Drivers (“Centerline”) brand. Centerline delivers drivers specifically matched to each client’s needs, allowing them to improve productivity, control costs, ensure compliance and deliver improved service. Centerline offers three solutions for clients: Our Flexible Drivers solution, which is an on-demand service helping clients find drivers where and when they need them; our Driver Management Services solution, which offers fully outsourced recruitment and management of drivers for a client, including recruitment, management and supervision; and our Mobile Drivers solution, which provides short-term relocation of qualified, experienced drivers for special projects or to high-need markets or remote locations where drivers are unavailable.
Through our PeopleScout business segment, we connected approximately 335,000 people with work in fiscal 2021. PeopleScout provides RPO services that manage talent solutions spanning the global economy and talent advisory capabilities supporting total workforce needs. We are recognized as an industry leader for RPO services and have proven experience in major industries and a variety of positions. PeopleScout solutions are highly scalable and flexible, which allows for outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across a series of recruitment, hiring and onboarding steps. Our programs deliver improved talent quality and candidate experience, faster hiring, increased scalability, lower cost of recruitment, greater flexibility and improved regulatory compliance. We leverage our proprietary technology platform (AffinixTM) for sourcing, screening and delivering a permanent workforce, along with dedicated service delivery teams to work as an integrated partner with our clients. Affinix uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to rapidly source a qualified talent pool, creating an initial slate of candidates for a job posting within minutes rather than days. Client contracts are generally multi-year in duration and pricing is typically composed of a fee for each hire and talent consulting fees. Pricing is impacted by factors such as geography, volume, job type, degree of recruiting difficulty, and the scope of outsourced recruitment and employer branding services included.
PeopleScout also includes our MSP business, which manages our clients’ contingent labor programs including vendor selection, performance management, compliance monitoring and risk management. As the client’s exclusive MSP, we have dedicated service delivery teams, which work as an integrated partner with our clients to increase the productivity of their contingent workforce program.
INDUSTRY AND MARKET DYNAMICS
The staffing industry, which includes our PeopleReady and PeopleManagement services, supplies contingent workforce solutions to minimize the cost and effort of hiring and managing permanent employees. This allows for rapid response to changes in business conditions through the ability to replace absent employees, fill new positions, and convert fixed or permanent labor costs to variable costs. Staffing companies act as intermediaries to match available associates with employer work assignments. Work assignments vary widely in duration, skill level and required experience. The staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with many competing companies. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Staffing companies compete both to recruit and retain a supply of associates, and to attract and retain clients who will employ these associates. Client demand for contingent staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the economy, specific industry 
Page - 5


and sector performance, and workforce flexibility trends. This creates volatility for the staffing industry based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the number of companies providing contingent workforce solutions has increased due to low barriers to entry, whereas, during recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies or other events. PeopleReady and PeopleManagement are leaders in industrial staffing services.
The human resource outsourcing industry, which includes our PeopleScout services, involves transitioning various functions handled by internal human resources and labor procurement to outside service providers on a permanent or project basis. Human resource departments are faced with increasingly complex operational and regulatory requirements, increased candidate expectations, an expanding talent technology landscape, and pressure to achieve efficiencies, which increase the need to migrate non-core functions to outsourced providers. The human resource outsourcing industry includes RPO and MSP solutions, which allow clients to more effectively find and engage high-quality talent, leverage talent acquisition technology and scale their talent acquisition function to keep pace with changing business needs. PeopleScout is a leader in RPO and MSP services.
Our workforce solutions address the following key industry and market trends contributing to anticipated growth:
•Workforce flexibility and scalability: The staffing industry continues to experience increased demand in relation to total job growth as demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs, meet dynamic seasonal demands and respond to rapidly changing market conditions. Providers in the human resource outsourcing industry can add significant scalability to a company’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal, project or peak hiring needs without sacrificing quality. These providers also help clients increase efficiency and drive lower overhead costs by standardizing processes, reducing time to fill, and onboarding the best fit talent into a client’s organization.
•Workforce productivity: Companies are under increasing competitive pressures to improve productivity through workforce solutions that improve performance and enable clients to focus on their core business.
•Leveraging technology to access talent: Automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming talent recruitment and service delivery. The fragmented talent technology ecosystem is becoming more crowded, with significant investments flowing in and new technology coming online rapidly. Associates are demanding more flexibility in how, when and where they work, as well as access to contingent work opportunities through mobile technology. Available associates are in high demand and have more power to find the employment situation they desire. As competition for qualified candidates increases, clients are relying on service providers to elevate the employer brand, build talent communities, create a world-class candidate experience, leverage innovative talent technology, and facilitate effective recruitment marketing and candidate communication strategies.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our business strategy is focused on growth in each of our business segments by investing in innovative technology and initiatives that drive organic growth and improve the client and candidate experience. Our clients have a variety of challenges in running their businesses, each of which are unique to the competitive pressures of their industry. Our business segments are industry leaders dedicated to staffing solutions tailored to our clients’ needs and the industries in which they operate. We ensure our differentiated solutions keep pace with the changing needs of our clients while driving growth through the following strategies:
•We continue to invest in technology to gain market share, accelerate revenue growth, reduce the cost of delivering our services, and increase our ability to attract and retain clients, employees and associates. We are committed to leveraging technology to improve the experience of our associates, candidates, clients and permanent employees. Our technological innovations make it easier for our clients to do business with us, and easier to connect associates with work opportunities and candidates to permanent employment opportunities. We continue to make significant investments in online and mobile apps to improve the access, speed and ease of connecting our clients with high-quality contingent and permanent employee workforce solutions.
◦Augmenting our PeopleReady branch network is our JobStack platform, which connects our associates and clients through a real-time 24 hours a day, seven days a week digital exchange with an easy-to-use mobile app. JobStack enables our branches to expand their recruiting and sales efforts, while allowing centralized service centers to better manage the recruiting, onboarding and service delivery efforts. JobStack is helping to competitively differentiate our services, expand our reach into new demographics, and improve both service delivery and work order fill rates as we continue to execute our digital strategy. Currently 95% of PeopleReady’s associates use JobStack to find on-demand work. During 2021, we introduced new functionality allowing clients to enter hours and associates to approve hours directly in the app, which eliminates manual processing and accelerates the payroll process. We introduced JobStack to 
Page - 6


our clients in 2018, and by the end of 2021 over 29,000 of our clients were using JobStack to place orders for associates, rate their performance, and approve their time worked, an increase of 13%, compared to the prior year. During fiscal 2021, PeopleReady dispatched approximately 3.4 million shifts via JobStack and achieved a digital fill rate of 58%, compared to approximately 2.9 million shifts and a digital fill rate of 53% in the prior year. We are focused on driving growth in the number of heavy client users of JobStack. A heavy client user is a client who has 50 or more touches (for example, entering an order or rating a worker) on JobStack per month. Heavy client users have consistently posted better year-over-year growth rates compared to all other PeopleReady clients. Our heavy client user mix increased to 48% of PeopleReady’s U.S. on-demand business in 2021 from 29% in 2020. We continue to expand functionality to further leverage this technology to transform our business by reducing expenses, accelerating revenue growth and enhancing our client and associate retention.
◦Augmenting our PeopleManagement dedicated on-site contingent workforce management is Stafftrack®. Stafftrack is a proprietary hiring and workforce management software that enables us to recruit and connect the best candidates with on-site assignments. Stafftrack has robust, real-time analytics that drive dynamic supply chain and workforce strategies, which allow clients faster, more precise hiring and help drive operational improvements and efficiencies. The Stafftrack associate mobile app provides associates the ability to search for a job, view their schedules, pick-up shifts and receive real-time notifications. We continue to expand functionality within Stafftrack to further enhance our client and associate experience.
◦Augmenting our PeopleScout dedicated service delivery teams is our Affinix platform used for sourcing, screening and delivering a permanent workforce to our clients. Affinix creates a consumer-like candidate experience and streamlines the sourcing process. Affinix delivers speed and scalability while leveraging recruitment marketing, machine learning, predictive analytics and other emerging technology to make the end-to-end process seamless for the candidate. We continue to invest in Affinix to further improve our ability to quickly and efficiently source the most attractive talent at the best price.
•We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence for specialized blue-collar staffing services, expand our geographical reach, provide a broad range of general staffing services, and dispatch our associates without the use of a physical location within our branch network. Continued investment in specialized sales, recruiting and service expertise will create a more seamless experience for our clients to access all our services with more comprehensive solutions to enhance their performance and our growth. Our business segments offer complementary workforce solutions with unique value propositions to meet our clients’ demands for talent. 
•Our RPO services leverage our strong brand and innovative technology for high-volume sourcing and dedicated client service teams for connecting people to opportunities. We have a track record of helping our clients reduce the cost of hiring, add significant scalability to recruiting and hiring, and access numerous sources to quickly find the best talent, thereby delivering a better outcome for the client. We will continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts to reach new clients as the demand for outsourced recruiting support increases.
•Our MSP business is focused primarily on managing the contingent labor programs of domestic, middle-market companies with a growing dependence on contingent labor. This enables our clients to efficiently source, engage, fulfill, measure and manage all categories of contingent and externally-sourced labor. We are uniquely positioned to manage the full range of our clients’ labor needs.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. As of December 26, 2021, we employed approximately 6,400 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees. We have approximately 5,000 FTE employees in North America, of which approximately 95% are in the U.S., 300 FTE employees in Europe, and 1,100 FTE employees in Asia Pacific. None of our permanent employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as evidenced by our semi-annual employee engagement survey results. Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) regularly receives reports regarding the progress on our key human capital initiatives. These reports inform discussions regarding the development, retention and engagement of our employees. Some of our key human capital management initiatives are discussed below.
Culture and engagement
We believe a strong corporate culture and employee engagement is key to attracting and retaining talented employees. To assess and improve our culture, we routinely utilize an independent third-party to measure how favorably our employees view our organizational culture and engagement. These surveys include corporate culture assessments, as well as real-time feedback on employee engagement and employee-management relations. The results of these surveys are reported and distributed throughout management and the Board, and are used to create actionable plans to improve employee engagement and retention. Our October 2021 survey achieved an all-time high engagement score of 78, which is an increase of 4 points from our September 2020 survey, and continues to exceed the benchmark of 67 set by the independent survey provider.
Developing our people
In order to continually attract and retain talented employees, we focus on personal development and career growth through our Full Performance program. Our Full Performance program for employees focuses on career planning and development, continuous learning, and the creation of internal career opportunities. We provide a range of training courses to our employees to enable more effective onboarding, work performance, compliance and advancement of corporate initiatives. This strategy supports our intent to foster a culture that enables all employees to realize their full professional potential and cultivates a qualified bench of future leaders.
Employees create individual development plans, identify specific skill gaps and development goals, and chart a path for career growth. We aim to strengthen skills that transfer across roles, business segments and functions. Managers meet regularly with employees to discuss their plans, and yearly assessments provide a formal process for tracking progress. This standardized process also ensures employees in similar positions are similarly evaluated.
Health, safety and wellness
We provide our employees and their families with flexible health and wellness programs, including competitive benefits. Our benefits include health, dental and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and family care resources.
Beginning in 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), we implemented significant changes to ensure the health and safety of our employees. These changes included an investment in the technology necessary to allow the majority of our support center employees to work from home and a reimbursement for certain expenses associated with moving to home-based work. Through the distribution and provision of necessary personal protective equipment, the continuing use of education and awareness, and changes to our operating processes, we are working to ensure our offices remain open and a safe place for our employees.

Diversity, equity and inclusion
We are dedicated to fostering, recognizing and embracing diversity at every level of the organization. Our Chief Executive Officer and executive team are committed to having opportunities and a career path for everyone in the organization. To strengthen this commitment, in January 2021, we hired a Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Our philosophy on diversity, equity and inclusion is to create an environment where every employee can experience merit-based career growth, receive the training and development they need to succeed, gain access to new opportunities, and be their authentic selves. Today, 67% of our Board is comprised of members from under-represented groups. As of December 26, 2021 approximately 66% of the global FTE employee population was female and approximately 50% of employees in positions at the senior management level and above were female. Of our total domestic FTE employee population, approximately 45% consider themselves ethnically diverse. While we believe we have assembled a diverse internal employee workforce, we are committed to making further improvements.
We have a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (the “Council”) which designs and launches initiatives that advance acceptance and inclusion. The Council reports regularly to executive leadership, who brief our Board periodically through the year. The Council also sponsors training to build diversity and inclusion awareness, and supports Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are employee-led groups that create opportunities for employees to collaborate based on shared characteristics or life experiences to support each other for enhanced career and personal development. ERGs seek to maximize employee engagement and contribute to our overall business objectives by offering diverse perspectives, networking opportunities and increased cultural awareness. We currently have eight ERGs for employees sharing similar ethnicity, nationality, gender, lifestyle choice or life experience and their respective allies. Through these initiatives, we learn how our differences build stronger teams and how our histories reveal similarities.
Associates
Associates are the people we put to work for our clients. We attract our pool of associates through our proprietary mobile apps, online resources, extensive internal databases, advertising, job fairs, community-based organizations and various other methods. We identify the skills, knowledge, abilities and personal characteristics of our associates and match their competencies and capabilities to our clients’ requirements. This enables our clients to obtain immediate value by placing a highly productive employee on the job site. We use a variety of proprietary programs and methods for identifying and assessing the skill level of our associates when selecting a particular individual for a specific assignment and retaining those associates for future assignments. We believe that our programs and methods enable us to offer a higher quality of service by increasing productivity, decreasing turnover, reducing absenteeism and improving associate safety.
Associates come to us because of the flexibility we offer to fill a short-term financial need and/or provide longer-term contingent flexible labor opportunities. Associates may be assigned to different jobs and job sites, and their assignments could last for a few hours or extend for several weeks or months. We provide our associates meaningful work and the opportunity to improve their skills. We provide a bridge to permanent, full-time employment for thousands of associates each year. We are considered the legal employer of our associates, and laws regulating the employment relationship are applicable to our operations. We believe we have an overall positive relationship with our associates.
We remain focused and committed to associate safety. We have developed an integrated risk management program that focuses on loss analysis, education and safety improvement programs to reduce the safety risks that may be encountered by our associates. We continuously track injuries to our associates at our client job sites across regions, industries and brands to identify trends that allow us to focus our safety resources on the types of jobs that may lead to more injuries. We distribute educational materials to our clients and associates, and perform client site visits to address specific safety risks unique to their industry or job site.
In this unprecedented environment due to COVID-19, we have provided masks for all our associates, distributed infrared thermometers for branches and job sites, established a resource center for staff, and implemented drive-in job fairs to reduce person-to-person contact.

COMPETITION
Contingent staffing services
The staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with large publicly-held companies as well as privately-owned companies on a national, regional and local level. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. We compete primarily with local and regional companies. We also experience competition from internet-based companies providing a variety of flexible workforce solutions. The strongest staffing services competitor in a particular market is a company with established relationships and a track record of meeting the clients’ needs.
Competition exists in attracting clients as well as qualified associates. Competitive forces have historically limited our ability to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset the increased costs of doing business, some of which include increased associate wages, workers’ compensation costs, unemployment insurance and health care.
The most significant competitive factors are price, ability to promptly fill client orders, success in meeting clients’ expectations of recruiting associates, and appropriately addressing client service issues. We believe we derive a competitive advantage from our service history, our specialized approach in serving the industries of our clients, and our mobile apps, which connect associates with jobs and create virtual exchanges between our associates and clients. Our PeopleReady JobStack and PeopleManagement Stafftrack mobile apps are helping to competitively differentiate our services, expand our reach into new demographics, and improve our recruiting, sales and service delivery. Our national presence, industry specialization, investment in technology, and proprietary systems and processes, together with specialized programs focused on worker safety, risk management, and legal and regulatory compliance are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
Human resource outsourcing
Our strongest competitors are companies who specialize in RPO services, as well as companies who offer broader human resource outsourcing solutions, which include RPO services. No single provider dominates the market. Competition also includes internal human resource departments that are not considering outsourcing. The most significant competitive factors for RPO services are the ability to attract top talent, reduce cost per hire, improve retention, deploy best in breed technology solutions and improve employment branding. Important factors for success in RPO services include the ability to add significant scalability to a client’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal and irregular hiring; the ability to increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees; and the ability to source the most attractive talent at the best price. Our tailored solutions, client partnerships, proprietary technologies and service delivery are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
TRADEMARKS
We own several trademarks that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Union Community Trademark Office and numerous individual country trademark offices.
CYCLICAL AND SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
The workforce solutions business has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Clients tend to use a contingent workforce to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire permanent employees when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenue from services tends to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow. Conversely, our revenue from services decreases quickly when the economy begins to weaken and contingent staff positions are eliminated, permanent hiring is frozen and turnover replacement diminishes.
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations for contingent staffing services. Demand is lower during the first and second quarters, due in part to limitations to outside work during the winter months and slowdown in manufacturing and logistics after the holiday season. Demand for contingent labor peaks during the third quarter for outdoor work and the fourth quarter for manufacturing and logistics, warehousing and distribution, and retail for the holiday season. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by our associate payroll and client accounts receivable. Since receipts from clients lag payroll to associates, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth.
REGULATION
Our services are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. We continuously monitor legislation and regulatory changes for their potential effect on our business. We invest in technology and process improvements to implement required changes while minimizing the impact on our operating efficiency and effectiveness. Regulatory cost increases are passed through to our clients to the fullest extent possible.
