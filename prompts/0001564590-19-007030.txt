Overview
 We are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel medicines to treat chronic diseases with significant unmet need. We are developing emricasan, a first-in-class, orally active pan-caspase inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with chronic liver disease. Emricasan is designed to reduce the activities of human caspases, which are enzymes that mediate inflammation and apoptosis. We are also developing CTS-2090, an orally active selective caspase inhibitor, for diseases involving inflammasome pathways.
 In collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, we plan to advance toward registration of emricasan for patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. Preclinical studies and clinical trials have yielded compelling results that suggest emricasan may have clinical utility in slowing the progression of liver disease regardless of the original cause of the disease. To date, emricasan has been studied in over 700 subjects in 17 completed clinical trials across a broad range of liver disease etiologies and stages of progression.

We are conducting three EmricasaN, a Caspase inhibitOR, for Evaluation clinical trials, or the ENCORE trials, designed to provide further information on doses leading to clinically relevant efficacy, including improvement in severe portal hypertension and hepatic function in patients with NASH cirrhosis and improvement in biopsy-proven fibrosis and inflammation in patients with NASH fibrosis. These three trials are also designed to provide safety data to support the registration of emricasan for NASH. We expect these trials to build on the data from our completed clinical trials where emricasan provided improvements in validated functional surrogate endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function. 
 Our current clinical program for emricasan includes the following:
 Phase 2b ENCORE-NF (NASH Fibrosis) Clinical Trial: In January 2016, we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating emricasan’s potential long-term benefits for patients with liver fibrosis resulting from NASH. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate the effect of emricasan in reducing fibrosis and steatohepatitis in approximately 330 patients with NASH fibrosis, but not cirrhosis. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 72 weeks. The primary endpoint is a biopsy-based one point or greater improvement in NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis score compared with placebo at week 72, with no worsening of steatohepatitis. The primary endpoint will be evaluated and can be achieved in either of two prospectively defined patient populations – the F1/F2/F3 population or the F2/F3 population. Either of these populations may be used in a future Phase 3 trial. We believe that the ENCORE-NF analysis plan has the potential to facilitate discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the trial’s use to support regulatory approval. Top-line results are expected in the first half of 2019. 
 Phase 2b ENCORE-LF (Liver Function) Clinical Trial: In May 2017, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate emricasan in approximately 210 patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for at least 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is event-free survival for each treatment group compared with the placebo group. For the purposes of the trial, events are defined as all-cause mortality, new decompensation events, or a progression of ≥4 points in the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, or MELD, score. Key secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, MELD and Child-Pugh-Turcotte, or CPT, scores, liver transplantation rates and health-related quality of life. Enrollment was completed in the first quarter of 2019. Top-line results triggered by reaching a prespecified number of events are expected in mid-2019.
 Phase 2b ENCORE-PH (Portal Hypertension) Clinical Trial: In November 2016, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the effect of emricasan in reducing hepatic venous pressure gradient, or HVPG, in approximately 240 compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis patients with severe portal hypertension, established by baseline HVPG values of 12 mmHg or higher. Patients are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the mean change in HVPG from week 0 to week 24 for each dosing group compared with placebo. In December 2018, we announced the trial did not meet its primary endpoint in the overall trial population. However, post-hoc analyses showed clinically meaningful treatment effects for emricasan compared with placebo and a trend toward clinical benefit in the prespecified subpopulation of compensated patients, with the greatest improvement in compensated patients with baseline HVPG ≥16 mmHg. Patients had the option to continue on their assigned doses of treatment or placebo in a 24-week extension period to evaluate longer term safety, liver function and clinical outcomes. Results following the extension period are expected in mid-2019.
 In addition, we initiated a non-treatment observational study in February 2018 pursuant to which subjects from the three trials above and the previously
 completed Phase 2b clinical trial in post-orthotopic liver transplant, or POLT, patients with reestablished liver fibrosis as a result of recurrent hepatitis C virus, or HCV, infection who have successfully achieved a sustained viral response, or SVR, following HCV antiviral therapy, or POLT-HCV-SVR trial, will be followed for an up to three-year safety follow-up.
 In February 2016, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted Fast Track designation to the emricasan development program for the treatment of liver cirrhosis caused by NASH. The Fast Track program provides greater access to the FDA in order to expedite review of drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. 
 In May 2017, Novartis exercised its option under the Option, Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into with Novartis in December 2016. Pursuant to such exercise, we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to our intellectual property rights relating to emricasan to collaborate with us for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis, including but not limited to Farnesoid X receptor agonists that Novartis is currently developing for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. The license became effective upon our receipt of a $7.0 million option exercise payment in July 2017.

Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for completing the three ENCORE trials described above and the completed Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR trial. We share the costs of these four Phase 2b trials equally with Novartis. In addition, until the completion of the four Phase 2b trials, we will equally share the costs of the non-treatment observational study that will follow patients from the four Phase 2b trials. After the completion of the four Phase 2b trials, Novartis will assume 100% of the observational study costs. Novartis is responsible for 100% of certain expenses for required registration-supportive nonclinical activities. Novartis is also responsible for the development of emricasan beyond the four Phase 2b trials described above, including the Phase 3 development of emricasan single agent products and all development for emricasan combination products, and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize emricasan products. A joint steering committee comprised of representatives from our company and Novartis oversees the collaboration, development and commercialization of emricasan products.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Novartis paid us an upfront payment of $50.0 million. Following Novartis’ exercise of the option under the Collaboration Agreement, we received the additional $7.0 million option exercise payment and are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $650.0 million in milestone payments over the term of the Collaboration Agreement, contingent on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties. After the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for an emricasan product candidate, we have the right to elect to enter into a co-commercialization agreement with Novartis under which we would receive up to 30% of the commercial profits less the same percentage of the commercial losses, subject to certain reductions in milestone and royalty payments.
 In our internal development program, we have assembled a proprietary portfolio of orally active molecules that inhibit inflammasome pathways and the activation of the potent inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β, or IL-1β. Inhibition of IL-1β is a clinically validated approach to treating inflammatory diseases, with several injectable biologic products using that mechanism of action already on the market. The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, for example, is dependent upon caspase 1, which activates IL-1β. As such, caspase 1 occupies a uniquely central position in the inflammasome pathway, and we have leveraged our scientific expertise in caspase research and development to design potent, selective and orally bioavailable inhibitors of caspase 1. Excess IL-1β has been linked to a variety of diseases including rare genetic inflammatory diseases, cancer, liver and other gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.
 We recently announced the selection of our first internally developed product candidate, CTS-2090, based on its preclinical profile, including high selectivity for caspase 1, and drug-like properties. CTS-2090 is currently in preclinical development and studies to enable the filing of an investigational new drug application, or IND, with an initial clinical trial expected to begin by the first half of 2020.
 With the recent advancement of our internally developed portfolio, we have at this time deprioritized the evaluation of our preclinical product candidate IDN-7314, a pan-caspase inhibitor, for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis, or PSC, a disease affecting bile ducts in the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. In June 2017, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to IDN-7314 for the treatment of PSC. In October 2017, the European Medicines Agency granted orphan designation to IDN-7314 for the treatment of PSC. Although we are not currently evaluating the potential of IDN-7314, we may again evaluate it as a product candidate as a component of our pipeline expansion plans. 
 We also may expand our development pipeline by internal development of additional preclinical product candidates leveraging our caspase inhibition expertise or in-licensing or acquiring preclinical or clinical-stage product candidates consistent with our product development and regulatory expertise. 
 Our Team
 Our senior management team includes former senior executives of Idun Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Idun. At Idun, these senior executives discovered and led the development of Idun’s lead asset emricasan, which was then known as IDN-6556, until the company was sold to Pfizer Inc. in July 2005. We acquired the global rights to emricasan from Pfizer, where it was known as PF-3491390, in July 2010. At both Idun and Pfizer, emricasan was being developed for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Due to our experience, we believe we can successfully develop emricasan for the treatment of one or more liver diseases, including NASH fibrosis and NASH cirrhosis. Furthermore, we believe our experience developing caspase inhibitors and product candidates in liver disease will enable us to expand our development pipeline beyond emricasan.

Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to develop and commercialize novel medicines to treat chronic diseases with significant unmet need, including but not limited to cirrhotic and fibrotic liver indications. The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Develop emricasan as a treatment for liver diseases. We believe that by inhibiting the caspases responsible for inflammation and apoptosis in the liver, emricasan has the potential to stabilize and improve liver function and to slow liver disease progression in patients with liver cirrhosis or fibrosis. In collaboration with Novartis, we plan to advance emricasan toward registration for patients with cirrhosis or fibrosis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase the commercial potential of emricasan through the Novartis collaboration. We believe the collaboration with Novartis will increase the commercial potential of emricasan by leveraging the resources of a large pharmaceutical company with expertise in liver disease, experience in drug development and marketing application approval, and established sales and marketing capabilities and potentially by pursuing the development and commercialization of combination products containing emricasan along with compounds developed or acquired by Novartis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop CTS-2090 for diseases involving inflammasome pathways. We believe caspase 1 occupies an important position in inflammasome pathways and in the IL-1β inflammatory cascade, controlling the production of IL-1β and initiation of pyroptotic cell death, and we believe an effective, oral caspase 1 inhibitor could have impact across a number of inflammasome-related diseases. Therefore, we plan to develop CTS-2090 for chronic diseases involving inflammasome pathways.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop, in-license or acquire new product candidates to expand our pipeline. Beyond emricasan and CTS-2090, we may pursue additional product candidates in the future. We may expand our development pipeline by developing additional internal preclinical product candidates or by in-licensing or acquiring preclinical or clinical-stage product candidates. We may develop such product candidates independently or in collaboration with third parties.

Liver Disease and Apoptosis
 The liver is the largest internal organ in the human body and its proper function is indispensable for many critical metabolic functions, including the regulation of lipid and sugar metabolism, the production of important proteins, including those involved in blood clotting, and purification of blood. There are over 100 described diseases of the liver, and because of its many functions, these can be highly debilitating and life-threatening unless effectively treated. Liver diseases can result from injury to the liver caused by a variety of insults, including HCV, hepatitis B virus, or HBV, obesity, chronic excessive alcohol use or autoimmune diseases. Regardless of the underlying cause of the disease, there are important similarities in the disease progression including increased inflammatory activity and excessive liver cell apoptosis, which if unresolved leads to fibrosis. Fibrosis, if allowed to progress, will lead to cirrhosis, or excessive scarring of the liver, and eventually reduced liver function. Some patients with liver cirrhosis have a partially functioning liver and may appear asymptomatic for long periods of time, which is referred to as compensated liver disease. Decompensated liver disease is when the liver is unable to perform its normal functions. Many people with active liver disease remain undiagnosed largely because liver disease patients are often asymptomatic for many years. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, estimates that 5.5 million Americans have chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, and liver disease is the twelfth leading cause of death in the United States. According to the European Association for the Study of the Liver, 29 million Europeans have chronic liver disease, and liver disease represents approximately 2% of deaths annually. In the United States in 2018, there were more than 8,000 liver transplants performed. There are currently approximately 14,000 active candidates on the transplant waiting list in the United States. Furthermore, NASH is expected to be the leading cause of liver transplants in the next five to ten years.
 The death of cells and resulting inflammation play an important role in the progression of many liver diseases. In general, cells can die by either of two major mechanisms, apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, or necrosis, which is uncontrolled cell death caused by infection, toxins or trauma. Both of these mechanisms can produce a state of acute and/or chronic inflammation. High levels of noxious stimuli can rapidly overwhelm the cell’s natural protective mechanisms, leading to a rupture of the cell and subsequent release of its contents into the surrounding tissue. This process is known as necrosis and results in a highly pro-inflammatory response, further damaging the surrounding tissue. In contrast, the programmed cell death mechanism, termed apoptosis, is a highly controlled and tightly regulated process that involves the orderly condensation and dismantling of the cell leading to its subsequent rapid and specific removal from the surrounding tissue by specialized cells. However, under conditions of excessive stress as often observed in disease, the production of apoptotic cells outpaces the body’s ability to effectively remove them from the surrounding tissue. This results in an accumulation of shed cell fragments known as apoptotic bodies, which are taken up by surrounding cells and can stimulate additional cell death. Disease-driven excessive apoptosis results in the development of scar tissue or fibrosis, which can lead to tissue destruction and eventually reduce the capacity of an organ to function normally.

Liver disease is often first detected as hepatitis, which is defined as inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis is easily detected by a routine laboratory test to measure blood levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. ALT is an enzyme that is produced in liver cells and is naturally found in the blood of healthy individuals. In liver disease, liver cells are damaged and as a consequence, ALT is released into the blood, increasing ALT levels above the normal range. Physicians routinely test blood levels of ALT to monitor the health of a patient’s liver. ALT level is a clinically important biochemical marker of the severity of liver inflammation and ongoing liver disease. ALT is elevated in almost all early- to mid-stage liver diseases and represents an overall measure of liver inflammation and liver cell death. However, in later stage cirrhosis patients, ALT levels have been shown to not be elevated above the normal range. Aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, is a second enzyme found in the blood that is produced in the liver and routinely measured by physicians along with ALT. As with ALT, AST is often elevated in liver disease and, like ALT, is considered an overall marker of liver inflammation. We have measured both ALT and AST levels in our clinical trials and have observed similar effects of emricasan on both enzymes. 
 NASH is typically suspected when a patient has elevated ALT or AST and no evidence or history of viral hepatitis or excessive alcohol use. As liver disease progresses, fibrotic scar tissue will begin to replace healthy liver tissue and over time will reduce the liver’s ability to function properly. A liver biopsy is used to diagnose fibrosis and determine how much liver scarring has developed. If fibrosis is allowed to progress, it will lead to cirrhosis. As liver cirrhosis becomes progressively worse, all aspects of liver function will dramatically decline.
 Another important marker of liver cell death is a protein fragment called cleaved Cytokeratin 18, or cCK18. During apoptosis, a key structural protein within the cell called Cytokeratin 18, or CK18, is specifically cleaved by caspases, which results in the release of cCK18 into the blood stream. cCK18 is easily detected in the blood with a commercially-available test and is a mechanism-specific biomarker of apoptosis and caspase activity. Unlike ALT, cCK18 is elevated in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Importantly, cCK18 is also present in healthy subjects and multiple studies have demonstrated an approximate basal level in healthy subjects. Numerous independent clinical trials and published studies have demonstrated the utility of cCK18 for detecting and gauging the severity of ongoing liver disease across a variety of disease etiologies. These studies have demonstrated correlations between disease and cCK18 levels in patients with liver cirrhosis, NASH, HCV and various other liver disease indications. For example, serum cCK18 levels corresponded well to an improvement in liver histology in two clinical trials of NASH in adults and children, respectively. Moreover, it has been shown that the severity of liver disease in HCV patients was associated with cCK18 levels and apoptosis, such that the more severe the disease, the higher the serum level of cCK18. In liver cirrhosis patients, studies have shown that cCK18 levels are elevated and correlate with liver inflammation and cholestasis. In POLT patients with recurrent HCV, it has been shown that cCK18 levels and apoptosis were significantly elevated in liver biopsies as determined by immunohistochemical analysis. We believe these studies demonstrate the relationship between elevated cCK18 levels and severity of liver disease and that cCK18 is an important biomarker of excessive apoptosis in liver disease.
 Emricasan
 Emricasan is a first-in-class, proprietary and orally active caspase protease inhibitor designed to slow or halt the progression of chronic liver disease caused by fibrosis and cirrhosis. To date, emricasan has been administered to over 700 subjects in eight completed Phase 1 and nine completed Phase 2 clinical trials and has been generally well-tolerated in both healthy volunteers and patients with liver disease. Emricasan has also been extensively profiled in in vitro tests and studied in many preclinical models of human disease. In previous clinical trials, emricasan has provided significant improvements in validated functional surrogate endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function across a variety of etiologies in the subgroups of liver cirrhosis patients with high medical need.

Mechanism of Action
 Emricasan works by inhibiting caspases, which are a family of related enzymes that play an important role as modulators of critical cellular functions, including functions that result in apoptosis and inflammation. Caspase activation and regulation is tightly controlled through a number of mechanisms. All caspases are expressed as enzymatically inactive forms known as pro-caspases, which can be activated following a variety of cellular insults or stimuli. Seven caspases are specifically involved in the process of apoptosis while three caspases specifically activate pro-inflammatory cytokines and are not directly involved in apoptosis as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Emricasan is a Potent Inhibitor of Apoptotic and Inflammatory Caspases

Caspase mediated apoptosis is driven primarily by the activity of caspases 3 and 7 which, by virtue of their enzymatic activity, cleave a wide variety of cellular proteins and result in dismantling of the cell. Other apoptotic caspase family members are principally involved in sensing and transmitting signals from either outside or inside the cell. These signals converge to activate pro-caspases 3 and 7, enabling them to carry out the process of apoptosis.
 CK18 is one key structural protein that is cleaved by caspases 3 and 7 in a highly specific manner. The product of this cleavage is a small protein fragment, cCK18. This fragment is contained within the apoptotic cell fragments and is easily detected in serum using a commercially available monoclonal antibody assay. This monoclonal antibody, M30, is used routinely in clinical trials as a measure of apoptosis.
 While healthy individuals have normal levels of apoptosis, excessive levels of apoptosis associated with disease can overwhelm the body’s normal clearance mechanisms. Reducing excessive levels of apoptosis reestablishes balance between apoptotic activity and normal clearance mechanisms and brings inflammation and other drivers of disease progression under control. As a result, we believe targeting caspases that drive both apoptosis and inflammation in disease offers a unique and potentially powerful therapeutic approach for the treatment of both acute and chronic liver disease.
 Testing in vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that emricasan efficiently inhibits all human caspases at low nanomolar concentrations. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that emricasan is highly selective for the caspase family of enzymes with little to no activity against other enzyme systems. These studies have also shown that emricasan potently inhibits the apoptosis of cells regardless of the apoptotic stimuli and that it is a potent inhibitor of caspase-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Emricasan has been examined in various preclinical models of liver disease. In these models, caspase activity was demonstrated to be inhibited, as determined by histological examination, in liver tissue. Based on our evaluation of emricasan in in vitro systems, cellular assays and disease models, we believe emricasan’s mechanism of action has been well characterized.

Clinical Data
 To date, emricasan has been studied in over 700 subjects in eight completed Phase 1 clinical trials and nine completed Phase 2 clinical trials. This includes approximately 500 subjects with liver disease, 50 liver transplant subjects and 150 healthy volunteers receiving single or multiple doses of emricasan ranging from 1 to 500 mg per day orally or 0.1 to 10 mg/kg per day intravenously for up to 12 weeks. Emricasan has demonstrated evidence of a beneficial effect on serological biomarkers in patients with chronic liver disease independent of the cause of disease. Favorable changes have been observed in functional biomarkers of liver damage and inflammation, such as ALT and AST, and mechanistic biomarkers, such as cCK18 and caspase activity, indicating that emricasan inhibited apoptosis of liver cells. Importantly, clinical trials have also demonstrated that emricasan did not inhibit normal levels of caspase activity in healthy individuals. Emricasan clinical trial results have demonstrated that emricasan treatment resulted in significant improvements in validated functional surrogate endpoints of portal hypertension and liver function across a variety of etiologies in the subgroups of liver cirrhosis patients with high medical need. Emricasan has been generally well-tolerated in clinical trials completed to date.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
 We have conducted nine Phase 2 clinical trials in subjects with both single and multiple-dose administration of emricasan. The objective of these trials was to examine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and, in some trials, the mechanistic pharmacodynamics, or PD, of emricasan. As shown in Figure 2 below, emricasan was generally well-tolerated in all nine completed Phase 2 clinical trials.

Phase 2b HVPG Clinical Trial of IDN-6556
 In December 2018, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2b ENCORE-PH clinical trial of emricasan in compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis patients with severe portal hypertension. The trial’s primary endpoint was change in mean HVPG from baseline to week 24 in any of three emricasan dosing groups compared with placebo. The total patient population was composed of two prespecified subgroups – patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis (201 of 263 patients, or 76%) and patients with 
 9

early decompensated NASH cirrhosis (62 of 263 patients, or 24%). The trial did not meet its primary endpoint in the overall trial population, but clinically meaningful treatment effects were observed in subsets of the compensated patient subgroup.
 In post-hoc analyses, the high-risk subgroup of compensated patients with HVPG ≥16 mmHg, which is the clinical cutoff to predict decompensation and higher risk of death, at baseline showed a clinically meaningful ≥2-point improvement in mean HVPG compared with placebo in all three emricasan dosing groups, as shown below in Figure 3.

 *Post-hoc chi-square test for assessing difference in response rates (95% CI of risk difference)
 Emricasan was generally well-tolerated in the ENCORE-PH clinical trial, and the overall safety profile was similar in the emricasan and placebo groups. Patients enrolled in the ENCORE-PH clinical trial are continuing treatment or placebo in a six-month extension period to evaluate longer term safety, liver function and clinical outcomes, and results from the extension are expected in mid-2019.
 Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR Clinical Trial of IDN-6556
 
In April 2018, we announced top-line results from our exploratory Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR proof-of-concept clinical trial of emricasan in POLT-HCV-SVR patients. The patients’ transplanted livers had residual fibrosis or cirrhosis (baseline Ishak Fibrosis Score of F2 to F6). Patients were stable transplant recipients who were an average of seven years post-transplant on chronic immunosuppression. HCV, the initial cause of the inflammatory insult to the transplanted liver, was eliminated by antiviral therapies prior to the study. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 25 mg of emricasan or placebo, twice daily for two years. Biopsies were taken at baseline, after one year of treatment, and after two years of treatment.
 
The primary endpoint was defined as the difference in percentage of responders between the treatment and placebo arms at the two-year biopsy compared with the baseline biopsy. A response was defined as improvement or stability in Ishak Fibrosis Score for patients with baseline scores of F2 to F5 or improvement in Ishak Fibrosis Score for patients with baseline scores of F6. The prespecified goal was a difference of 15 percentage points or more in response rates between the treatment and placebo arms. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint in the heterogeneous overall trial population, but an emricasan treatment effect was observed in the post-hoc subgroup of patients with advanced fibrosis and early cirrhosis.
 
A descriptive summary of the observed response rates after two years of dosing for different stages of fibrosis is provided below in Figure 6. All p values noted are post-hoc, as prospective statistical powering was not feasible in this previously unstudied patient population.

 *Prespecified subgroups
 
Emricasan provided evidence of an anti-fibrotic treatment effect in the prespecified subgroup of patients with advanced fibrosis or early cirrhosis (F3-F5 at baseline), with 95.0% of patients (19/20) in the emricasan arm achieving responses in Ishak Fibrosis Score after two years of treatment, compared with 58.3% (7/12) in the placebo arm, a 36.7 percentage point difference in response rate (p<0.02). In addition, in patients with the potential to continue worsening, those less than F6 at baseline, only 2 of 26 (7.7%) on emricasan compared with 5 of 17 (29.4%) on placebo showed an increase in fibrosis score at year 2 – a treatment difference of 21.7 percentage points. Inflammatory activity markers (i.e., ALT, cCK18, flCK18 and Knodell activity index components) were either normal or only slightly elevated at baseline.

Phase 2 Clinical Trial of IDN-6556 in Subjects with Liver Cirrhosis
 In January 2016, we announced results from the three-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled stage of the six-month Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with liver cirrhosis due to different etiologies, mild to moderate liver impairment and a MELD score of 11 to 18 during the screening period. The double-blind, placebo-controlled stage of this clinical trial was conducted at 26 U.S. sites and enrolled 86 patients. Among the 86 subjects enrolled and dosed, liver cirrhosis etiologies included alcohol (38%), HCV (29%), NASH (23%), and other causes (9%). Baseline MELD scores were ≤14 in 78% of enrolled subjects and ≥15 in 22% of enrolled subjects. Baseline CPT status was A (CPT score of 5-6) in 43% of subjects and B (CPT score of 7-9) in 56% of subjects. 
 These results showed a statistically significant reduction in cCK18 vs. placebo (p=0.04) at month three in the overall patient population when adjusted for differences between treatment and placebo groups in baseline MELD score and disease etiology as specified in the trial statistical analysis plan. cCK18 is a mechanism-specific biomarker of caspase-driven cell death. Multiple additional liver disease biomarkers achieved statistically significant reductions vs. placebo in the overall patient population after three months of treatment, including caspase 3/7 and ALT, while others achieved positive trends. Collectively, two key secondary endpoints and clinically relevant measures of liver function, MELD score and CPT score, along with other key liver function parameters, demonstrated favorable trends vs. placebo in the overall patient population after three months of treatment. The trends in the overall patient population were driven by statistically significant improvements in a subgroup of patients with baseline MELD scores ≥15. Additional endpoint results in various subgroups for the first three months are shown below in Figure 7.

In May 2016, we announced top-line results from the three-month, open-label second stage of this trial. In the second stage, patients on emricasan in the first stage continued treatment for another three months, and patients on placebo in the first stage switched to emricasan for three months. In a mixed etiology subgroup of patients with baseline MELD scores ≥15, statistically significant emricasan treatment effects vs. placebo (improvement in the emricasan group vs. progression in the placebo group) after the first three months showed continued directional improvements after the second three months of treatment with emricasan. In patients whose liver cirrhosis was caused by NASH, statistically significant emricasan treatment effects vs. placebo (slower progression in the emricasan group than in the placebo group) on measures of liver function after the first three months showed continued directional improvement after the second three months of treatment with emricasan regardless of baseline MELD score. Other etiologies showed similar directional improvements after the first three months and continued during the second three months. We believe the statistically significant treatment effects in the NASH patient subgroup, which applied regardless of baseline MELD scores, offer a range of options for future clinical trials in patients with NASH cirrhosis.
 Emricasan was generally well-tolerated in the clinical trial, and the overall safety profile was similar in the emricasan and placebo groups with regard to both serious and other adverse events.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial of IDN-6556 in Cirrhotic Subjects with Portal Hypertension
 We announced in September 2015 that the open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of emricasan in patients with liver cirrhosis due to different etiologies and portal hypertension confirmed by HVPG procedure upon enrollment met the following primary endpoints:  a) a clinically meaningful and statistically significant change from baseline in HVPG in patients with liver cirrhosis and severe portal hypertension (HVPG ≥12 mmHg); and b) a statistically significant change from baseline in cCK18 in the total evaluable patient population. Portal hypertension was confirmed by HVPG measurement >5 mmHg at baseline and measured again after treatment with 25 mg of emricasan orally twice daily for 28 days. Patients were divided according to the HVPG therapeutic threshold of 12 mmHg, which indicates more severe portal hypertension. Reducing the HVPG to below 12 mmHg or reducing HVPG by ≥10% or ≥20% has 
 12

been strongly associated with clinical benefit in this patient population. The HVPG endpoint was analyzed in: a) patients with baseline HVPG values ≥12 mmHg (N=12); b) patients with baseline HVPG values <12 mmHg (N=10); and c) all evaluable patients (N=22). HVPG measurement was standardized, and tracings were evaluated by a single expert reader not otherwise involved in the trial. HVPG decreased by a mean of 3.7 mmHg from the mean baseline of 20.6 mmHg in the ≥12 mmHg baseline HVPG group (p<0.003), with 8 of 12 patients achieving a ≥10% decrease, 4 of 12 patients achieving a ≥20% decrease, and 2 of 12 patients achieving reductions below 12 mmHg. The changes from baseline HVPG were not statistically significant in the <12 mmHg baseline HVPG group (+1.9 mmHg mean increase from mean baseline of 8.1 mmHg; p=0.12) or the total evaluable patient population (-1.1 mmHg from mean baseline of 15.2 mmHg; p=0.26). Sensitivity analysis using an HVPG cutoff of 10 mmHg yielded similar results. The cCK18 endpoint, analyzed in the total evaluable patient population, showed a statistically significant reduction (p<0.03) from baseline.
Consistent with results from prior trials, emricasan was safe and well-tolerated in the trial, with no dose-limiting toxicities and no drug-related serious adverse events. One subject discontinued the trial early for non-serious adverse events and one subject had three serious adverse events ten days after the last emricasan dose, assessed as unrelated to treatment. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. ALT and AST levels decreased significantly in the entire group and in those with an HVPG ≥12 mmHg. This clinical trial was conducted at nine U.S. sites and enrolled 23 patients, 22 of whom were evaluable, with portal hypertension and compensated liver cirrhosis that was predominantly due to NASH or HCV, including patients with active HCV infection and patients who had an SVR to antiviral therapy.
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial of IDN-6556 in Subjects with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Raised Transaminases
 In March 2015, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of emricasan in 38 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, including the subset of NAFLD patients with NASH. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in ALT in patients treated for 28 days with emricasan at 25 mg twice per day dosing compared to patients in the placebo control group. Reductions from baseline in ALT at Day 28 of approximately 39% in the emricasan treatment arm and approximately 14% in the placebo arm were similar to results observed in previous trials. Elevated baseline levels of three key serum biomarkers – cCK18, full-length cytokeratin 18, or flCK18, a biomarker of more generalized cell death, and caspase 3/7 – also showed statistically significant reductions from baseline in emricasan-treated patients at Day 28. A reduction from baseline in cCK18 at Day 28 of approximately 30% in the emricasan treatment arm and an increase from baseline of approximately 4% in the placebo arm were similar to results observed in previous trials. The reduction in serum cCK18 levels demonstrated that emricasan can effectively reduce inflammation and elevated levels of apoptosis in NAFLD/NASH patients. Emricasan was safe and well-tolerated in the NAFLD/NASH trial, with no dose-limiting toxicities and no drug-related serious adverse events. Treatment with emricasan also had no adverse effects on lipid levels or insulin sensitivity, important safety assessments in NAFLD/NASH patients who are at risk for cardiovascular disease. 
Phase 2b Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Clinical Trial in Acute-on-chronic Liver Failure Patients
 In January 2015, we completed a Phase 2b dose ranging clinical trial in acute-on-chronic liver failure, or ACLF, patients. The ACLF clinical trial was designed to assess the PK and PD of emricasan, as well as biomarker and clinical responses, following twice daily, or BID, oral dosing of emricasan or placebo for 28 days. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo, 5 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg emricasan BID. The primary objective in this 28-day dosing trial was to evaluate the PK and PD together with the safety of emricasan to determine whether any dosing adjustments are needed in this critically ill patient population. We measured changes in liver function (creatinine, bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio), changes in biomarkers (ALT, cCK18, caspase 3/7 and Interleukin 18, or IL-18), time to clinical worsening, or TTCW, which is defined as the first occurrence of liver transplant, progression to next organ failure or death and changes in extra-hepatic organ function. Twenty of 21 patients enrolled in the ACLF clinical trial had alcohol-associated liver disease, consistent with alcoholic liver disease being a major contributor to the ACLF patient population.
 ALT levels were not increased in the ACLF patient population. By contrast, levels of mechanism-specific biomarkers of caspase activity and inflammation – cCK18, caspase 3/7, IL-18 and flCK18 were all elevated at baseline, demonstrating their important role in the ACLF disease process. Dose-related responses to emricasan in elevated biomarkers were apparent with no response noted in the placebo cohort, limited or no response in the 5 mg BID cohort, an initial rapid but transitory response in the 25 mg BID cohort, and a rapid and sustained response in almost all of the 50 mg BID cohort. Emricasan 25 mg and 50 mg BID oral dosing reduced cCK18, flCK18 and caspase 3/7 levels within 24 hours post administration (Study Day 2) by at least 30%. More modest ~20% reductions in elevated IL-18 levels were also observed in the 25 mg and 50 mg BID cohorts by Day 7. Only the emricasan 50 mg dose resulted in sustained reductions in cCK18 over the entire dosing period in the majority of patients. The median reduction in the 50 mg BID cohort on Day 1 was 54% compared with a median reduction of 7%, 13% and 44% in the placebo, 5 mg and 25 mg cohorts, respectively. The observed reduction in cCK18 was maintained in the 50 mg BID cohort (median reduction of 56% and 50% on Day 4 and Day 7, respectively) but not maintained in the other cohorts. Emricasan exposure after the first dose was more than twice the exposure in patients with stable severe hepatic impairment. Emricasan was well-tolerated and there were no drug-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities. Adverse events observed were reflective of the patient populations being studied.

Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 We have conducted eight Phase 1 clinical trials in subjects with both single and multiple-dose administration of emricasan. The objective of these trials was to examine the safety, tolerability, PK and, in some trials, the mechanistic PD of emricasan. As shown in Figure 8 below, emricasan was generally well-tolerated in all eight Phase 1 clinical trials.

Emricasan History
 Emricasan was initially discovered and developed by researchers at Idun, where the company was developing a new class of drugs that modulate caspases involved in the apoptosis and inflammation pathways. Idun, co-founded by Nobel Prize winner H. Robert Horvitz, Ph.D. for his work in the apoptosis field, was uniquely positioned as a leading expert in translating apoptosis research into drug development candidates. Emricasan was Idun’s lead program when Pfizer acquired the company for $298 million in 2005.
 When we acquired emricasan through the acquisition of Idun from Pfizer in 2010, emricasan was on clinical hold in the United States due to an observation of inflammatory infiltrates in mice that Pfizer saw in a preclinical study and reported to the FDA in 2007. Pfizer performed additional preclinical studies attempting to characterize the nature of the inflammatory infiltrates, but did not carry out a formal carcinogenicity study to evaluate whether or not the infiltrates progressed to cancer. These infiltrates observed in mice were not observed in any other species. In 2008, Pfizer stopped work on the program. After acquiring emricasan in 2010, we conducted a thorough internal review of these studies and commissioned several independent experts to review all of the available data. The analysis provided by these experts unanimously concluded that these inflammatory infiltrates did not represent pre-cancerous lesions, nor were these infiltrates likely to progress to cancer. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of available apoptosis literature supported the conclusion that the infiltrates were not likely to be precursors to cancer.
 In April 2011, we met with the FDA to discuss plans for reinitiating clinical development of emricasan. We proposed conducting a carcinogenicity study designed to reproduce the previously observed findings of inflammatory infiltrates and determine whether they progress to cancer. We proposed using the Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse model, which is known to be predisposed toward 
 14

tumor development. The FDA agreed with the study design and agreed that if the study reproduced the previously observed inflammatory infiltrates, but did not produce cancer, the issue that generated the clinical hold would be resolved.
 This study was completed successfully in 2012. The inflammatory infiltrates were reproduced, and there was no evidence of tumor formation. In summary, treatment with emricasan for 26-weeks did not result in an increase in the incidence of tumors in Tg.rasH2 mice. The results were submitted to the FDA in preparation for a meeting in October 2012. The FDA reviewed the data and agreed with the study conclusion. We subsequently filed a new IND for emricasan for HCV-POLT, which was formally cleared in January 2013. In addition, the FDA has accepted this Tg.rasH2 carcinogenicity study as one of two carcinogenicity studies required for registration. We are currently conducting a two-year rat carcinogenicity study as the second carcinogenicity study. 
 Our Clinical Development Plans
 In collaboration with Novartis, we plan to focus on advancing toward registration of emricasan for patients with NASH fibrosis or NASH cirrhosis. We are conducting three trials, the ENCORE trials, designed to provide further information on doses leading to clinically relevant efficacy, including improvement in severe portal hypertension and hepatic function in patients with NASH cirrhosis and improvement in biopsy-proven fibrosis and inflammation in patients with NASH fibrosis. Together, we may pursue the development and commercialization of combination products containing emricasan along with compounds developed or acquired by Novartis, particularly for NASH indications. These three clinical trials are also designed to provide safety data to support the registration of emricasan for NASH.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to our intellectual property rights relating to emricasan to collaborate with us for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for completing the three ENCORE trials and the previously completed POLT-HCV-SVR trial. We share the costs of these four Phase 2b trials equally with Novartis, as well as the non-treatment observational study until the completion of the four Phase 2b trials. Novartis is also responsible for 100% of certain expenses for required registration-supportive nonclinical activities. Novartis is responsible for the development of emricasan beyond these four Phase 2b trials, including the Phase 3 development of emricasan single agent products and all development for emricasan combination products, and Novartis has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize emricasan products. A joint steering committee comprised of representatives from our company and Novartis oversees the collaboration, development and commercialization of emricasan products.
 Emricasan in NASH Fibrosis
 Medical Need and Market Opportunity
 NASH is a progressive form of NAFLD where fat builds up in the liver and patients suffer from inflammation and damage ultimately leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Steatosis is caused by the accumulation of triglycerides within lipid droplets in hepatocytes, and steatosis associated with inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis is referred to as NASH, which can progress to cirrhosis. According to the NIH, NASH affects 2-5% of people in the United States. NASH is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis in adults in the United States, and up to 25% of adults with NASH may have cirrhosis. The condition is more common in adults who are obese, diabetic, or have high cholesterol or high triglycerides. The current diagnosis rate for NASH is low because of the asymptomatic nature of NASH and low awareness of the disease. There are currently no drugs approved to treat NASH fibrosis.
Development Plans
 Emricasan has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of both NASH and NAFLD. In preclinical models of NASH, emricasan inhibited apoptosis, fibrosis and inflammation associated with experimental NASH. In a preclinical model of NAFLD, emricasan reduced inflammation of adipose tissue, resolved hepatic steatosis and improved metabolic parameters by reducing fasting glucose and insulin levels. We believe that these preclinical data provide support for evaluating emricasan in patients with NASH. Our Phase 2 clinical trial in NAFLD/NASH demonstrated that emricasan can effectively reduce elevated levels of biomarkers related to apoptosis and inflammation. 
 In collaboration with Novartis, we plan to develop emricasan toward registration for patients with NASH fibrosis in parallel with our liver cirrhosis development plans. In January 2016, we initiated the ENCORE-NF trial, a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating emricasan’s potential long-term benefits for patients with liver fibrosis resulting from NASH. This randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial will evaluate the effect of emricasan in reducing fibrosis and steatohepatitis in approximately 330 patients with NASH fibrosis but not cirrhosis. The primary endpoint is a biopsy-based change in fibrosis by at least one stage using the NASH Clinical Research Network Histologic Scoring System, without worsening of steatohepatitis. Treatment will be twice daily for 18 
 15

months and patients will receive either emricasan at 50 mg, emricasan at 5 mg, or placebo. Top-line results from the ENCORE-NF clinical trial are expected in the first half of 2019. 
 In addition to emricasan as a single active ingredient for a product candidate for the treatment of NASH fibrosis, we believe that emricasan has the potential to be developed for use whereby emricasan is one of two or more active ingredients. Under the Collaboration Agreement with Novartis, we expect the development of emricasan with one or more Novartis compounds to be pursued as a combination product to treat NASH fibrosis or other liver diseases.
 Emricasan in NASH Cirrhosis
 Medical Need and Market Opportunity
 The patients with chronic liver disease that we are studying suffer from compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, as well as potentially portal hypertension. Continual disease progression may eventually lead such patients to require liver transplantation, in which the diseased liver is replaced by a donor liver or part thereof. The cause of the chronic decompensation or liver failure may vary, and includes infections, such as subacute bacterial peritonitis, HCV or HBV, metabolic causes, such as NASH, autoimmune diseases and alcohol. Objectives for the management of patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension include specific treatment of any identifiable causes of chronic liver function and prevention of the development or progression of signs of decompensation, including portal pressure, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and esophageal varices, with or without hemorrhage, in order for the patient to be eligible for transplant. More than 40,000 patients died due to chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the United States in 2016.
 NASH is one of the leading causes of cirrhosis in adults in the United States, and up to 25% of adults with NASH may have cirrhosis. Furthermore, NASH is expected to be the leading cause of liver transplant in the next five to ten years. There are currently no approved drugs for the treatment of NASH cirrhosis.
 Development Plans
 Given its mechanism of action and clinical trial results, we believe emricasan has the potential to improve patients’ ability to survive longer with cirrhosis while waiting for a liver transplant and potentially to improve their liver disease status such that they may no longer require a liver transplant. In collaboration with Novartis, we plan to focus on advancing toward registration of emricasan for patients with NASH cirrhosis in parallel with our NASH fibrosis development plans. In February 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the emricasan development program for the treatment of liver cirrhosis caused by NASH. Based on the clinical trial results in patients with cirrhosis and interactions with the FDA, we initiated the Phase 2b ENCORE-PH trial in November 2016 and the Phase 2b ENCORE-LF trial in May 2017. 
 The ENCORE-PH trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the effect of emricasan in reducing HVPG in approximately 240 compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis patients with severe portal hypertension, established by baseline HVPG values of 12 mmHg or higher. Patients are randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, 50 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the mean change in HVPG from week 0 to week 24 for each dosing group compared with placebo. In December 2018, we announced the trial did not meet its primary endpoint in the overall trial population, but clinically meaningful treatment effects were observed in subsets of the compensated patient subgroup in the first 24-week treatment period. This trial has an additional 24-week open-label extension period for patients after they complete the blinded 24-week stage of the trial, and these results are expected in mid-2019. 
 The ENCORE-LF trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate emricasan in approximately 210 patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan, 25 mg of emricasan, or placebo twice daily for at least 48 weeks. The primary endpoint is event-free survival for each treatment group compared with the placebo group. For the purposes of the trial, events are defined as all-cause mortality, new decompensation events, or a progression of ≥4 points in MELD score. Key secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, MELD and CPT scores, liver transplantation rates, and health-related quality of life. Top-line results are expected in mid-2019.
 Future Indications for Emricasan
 Due to its mechanism of action and the presence of apoptosis and inflammation in many liver diseases, we believe there may be several patient populations that could potentially benefit from emricasan, including those that have previously failed HCV treatment and those with early-stage NAFLD, viral hepatitis and other chronic liver diseases. If emricasan demonstrates the ability to halt the progression of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the patient populations we are studying, we believe that this could serve as a basis to evaluate emricasan for additional indications in patients at earlier stages of liver fibrosis resulting from diseases that we are not currently studying, such as pre-transplant HCV, HBV, chronic excessive alcohol use or autoimmune diseases.

Commercialization Strategy
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Novartis will be responsible for the commercialization of emricasan, and we are eligible to receive up to $650.0 million in milestone payments over the term of the Collaboration Agreement, contingent on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties. After the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for an emricasan product candidate, we have the right to elect to enter into a co-commercialization agreement with Novartis under which we would receive up to 30% of the commercial profits less the same percentage of the commercial losses, subject to certain reductions in milestone and royalty payments. 
Manufacturing
 Pfizer completed a significant portion of the manufacturing process optimization needed to provide an efficient synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and scale-up methodology for registration trials for emricasan. API was successfully produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, and a strategy to scale up the API for commercialization is in development. We believe the quantities of API we acquired from Pfizer are sufficient to support our ongoing clinical trials. Although we believe the current quantities of API are sufficient to complete our ongoing clinical trials, additional API will potentially need to be manufactured for future clinical trials. We have identified a new third-party manufacturer of emricasan API for potential manufacturing needs in the future. Both the emricasan API and the drug product emricasan have demonstrated sufficient stability characteristics in our studies conducted to date. Furthermore, Novartis is responsible under the Collaboration Agreement for the manufacturing related to emricasan beyond the three Phase 2b ENCORE trials and the Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR trial.

 CTS-2090, an orally active, potent and highly selective inhibitor of caspase 1, is an internally discovered preclinical product candidate we are pursuing for chronic diseases involving inflammasome pathways. CTS-2090 is currently in preclinical development and IND-enabling activities, with clinical trials expected to begin by the first half of 2020.
 Inflammasomes are a collection of large multiprotein structures responsible for the activation of inflammatory responses. There are six known inflammasome subtypes - NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP6, AIM2 and IFI 16 - that respond to different stimuli. A primary function of the inflammasomes is to generate active caspase 1 from procaspase 1 in response to various pathogens and other stimuli. The ultimate products produced by the activation of caspase 1 are highly pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18. In addition, caspase 1 initiates pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death, through the cleavage of gasdermin D. Excess IL-1β has been linked to a variety of diseases including rare genetic inflammatory diseases, cancer, liver and other gastrointestinal diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.
 We believe caspase 1 occupies an important position in the IL-1β inflammatory cascade, controlling the production of IL-1β and initiation of pyroptotic cell death. Inhibition of caspase-1 provides a potential mechanism to block inflammation and reduce cell death by inhibiting pyroptosis. Currently, there are marketed biologic treatments directed at blocking IL-1β activity, but to our knowledge, there are no approved small molecules specifically targeted at reducing IL-1β activation. We believe an effective, oral caspase 1 inhibitor could have impact across a number of inflammasome-related diseases.
 Future Product Candidates
 We are currently focused on the development of emricasan and CTS-2090, but we plan to pursue additional product candidates in the future. We believe that a diversified portfolio will mitigate risks inherent in drug development and increase the likelihood of our success. We may expand our development pipeline by developing additional internal preclinical product candidates or by in-licensing or acquiring preclinical or clinical-stage product candidates. We may develop such product candidates independently or in partnership with third parties. 
Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although we believe that we hold a leading position in our understanding of caspase inhibition related to liver disease, our competitors may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.

Although there are several product candidates in clinical development, there are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH cirrhosis or NASH fibrosis. There are a number of marketed therapeutics used in each of these diseases to try to remove the underlying cause of the disease, address symptoms or complications of the disease or prevent further liver injury. If the liver damage is a result of obesity, diet and exercise may be prescribed along with marketed therapeutics. If the liver damage is a result of NASH, which is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplants in the next five to ten years, currently marketed drugs are generally used, although none of these are approved for NASH. In addition to the marketed drugs for those indications, there are drugs in development for each of these indications. Although these marketed therapies and those in development may be efficacious, all of them take time to show an effect, and as long as the underlying conditions persist there will continue to be damage to the liver. In NASH, for example, drugs in development have differing mechanisms of action, and it is currently unknown whether any single drug will eliminate liver inflammation and halt liver disease progression into advanced fibrosis. For each of these indications, emricasan is the only product candidate we are aware of that is being developed specifically to reduce the level of apoptosis in the liver. As a result, if successfully developed and approved, emricasan may be used with these other therapies and may be included as an active ingredient in combination products developed and commercialized by Novartis under the Collaboration Agreement. With respect to CTS-2090 and inflammasome related disease, there are marketed biologic treatments directed at blocking IL-1β activity, but to our knowledge, there are no approved small molecules specifically targeted at reducing IL-1β activation. We believe an effective, oral caspase 1 inhibitor could have impact across a number of inflammasome-related diseases.
 

Material Contracts
 Pfizer Inc. 
 In July 2010, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Idun, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer at the time, in consideration for an upfront payment of $250,000 and a promissory note in the principal amount of $1.0 million. In July 2013, the promissory note was amended to become convertible into shares of our common stock following the completion of our initial public offering, at the option of the holder, at a price per share equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of conversion. We had the right to prepay the promissory note at any time, and in January 2017, we voluntarily prepaid the entire balance of the principal and accrued interest of the promissory note. The promissory note bore interest at a per annum interest rate equal to 7%, compounded quarterly, and interest was payable on a quarterly basis during the term of the promissory note. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we will be required to make additional payments to Pfizer totaling $18.0 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to emricasan.
Idun Distribution Agreement
 In January 2013, we conducted a spin-off of our subsidiary Idun, which we had acquired from Pfizer in the transaction described above, to our stockholders at that time. Immediately prior to the spin-off, all rights relating to emricasan were distributed to us pursuant to a distribution agreement. 
Novartis Pharma AG
 In December 2016, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Novartis, pursuant to which we granted Novartis an exclusive option to collaborate with us to develop products containing emricasan. In May 2017, Novartis exercised its option under the Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to such exercise, we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide license to our intellectual property rights relating to emricasan to collaborate with us for the global development and commercialization of products containing emricasan either as a single active ingredient or in combination with other Novartis compounds for liver cirrhosis or liver fibrosis, for the treatment, diagnosis and prevention of disease in all indications in humans. The license became effective upon our receipt of a $7.0 million option exercise payment in July 2017.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for completing the three ENCORE trials. We share the costs of these three trials equally with Novartis. In addition, until the completion of the three Phase 2b trials, we will equally share the costs of the non-treatment observational study that will follow patients from the three ENCORE Phase 2b trials and the previously completed Phase 2b POLT-HCV-SVR trial. After the completion of the three ENCORE Phase 2b trials, Novartis will assume 100% of the observational study costs. Novartis is also responsible for 100% of certain expenses for required registration-supportive nonclinical activities. Novartis is responsible for Phase 3 development of products containing only emricasan as an active ingredient, or Emricasan Only Products, and all development for products containing emricasan and one or more other Novartis active ingredients, or Combination Products. Emricasan Only Products and Combination Products are collectively referred to as Emricasan Products. A joint steering committee comprised of senior personnel from our company and Novartis oversees the collaboration, development and commercialization of the Emricasan Products. 
 18

Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50.0 million and the option exercise payment of $7.0 million from Novartis. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $650.0 million in milestone payments over the term of the Collaboration Agreement, contingent on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Novartis will be required to pay us tiered royalties ranging from the high-teens to the high-twenties as a percentage of net sales of Emricasan Only Products, and tiered royalties ranging from the high-single digits to the mid-teens as a percentage of net sales of Combination Products, subject to reduction in certain cases. We may elect, after the initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial for an Emricasan Product, to enter into a co-commercialization agreement with Novartis under which we would receive up to 30% of the commercial profits less the same percentage of the commercial losses for Emricasan Products in the United States, subject to certain reductions in milestone and royalty payments.
For the period from the execution date of the Collaboration Agreement until the earlier of five years after the first commercial sale of an Emricasan Product in the United States or major European market or ten years from the execution date of the Collaboration Agreement, we have agreed not to develop in any pivotal registration clinical trials or commercialize any pan-caspase inhibitors in liver disease. For the period from the execution date of the Collaboration Agreement until five years after the first commercial sale of an Emricasan Only Product, Novartis has agreed not to develop in any pivotal registration clinical trials or commercialize any pan-caspase inhibitors for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease in all indications in humans. Novartis will have a right of first negotiation prior to any offer by us to any third party for future pan-caspase inhibitors that we may develop or acquire for the treatment of liver diseases or for certain retained pan-caspase inhibitors, provided that any license or collaboration that we enter into or propose to enter into must be on terms and conditions in the aggregate no more favorable to such third party than those last offered to Novartis.
 The Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until Novartis’ royalty obligations expire. Both parties have certain termination rights in the circumstances of an uncured material breach or insolvency by the other party. Novartis has certain termination rights in the event of a mandated clinical trial hold for any Emricasan Only Product. Novartis has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement without cause upon 180 days prior written notice to us. In such event, the license granted to Novartis will be terminated and revert to us, and Novartis will transfer any ongoing trials for the Emricasan Only Products to us and will cease development of the Emricasan Products. In the event Novartis terminates the Collaboration Agreement due to our uncured material breach or insolvency, the license granted to Novartis pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement will become irrevocable and Novartis will be required to continue to make all milestone and royalty payments otherwise due to us under the Collaboration Agreement, provided that if we materially breach the Collaboration Agreement such that the rights licensed to Novartis or the commercial prospects of the Emricasan Products are seriously impaired, the milestone and royalty payments will be reduced by 50%. In the event of a change of control of Conatus, Novartis has the right to disband the joint steering committee and all decision-making power otherwise assigned to the joint steering committee will be assigned solely to Novartis.
 Concurrent with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into an Investment Agreement with Novartis, or the Investment Agreement, whereby we agreed to sell and Novartis agreed to purchase, convertible promissory notes, in one or two closings, for an aggregate principal amount of up to $15.0 million. In February 2017, we issued a convertible promissory note, or the Novartis Note, in the principal amount of $15.0 million, pursuant to the Investment Agreement. The maturity date of the Novartis Note was December 31, 2019, and it bore interest on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 6% per annum. In December 2018, we, at our option, converted the entire outstanding principal of $15.0 million and accrued and unpaid interest of the Novartis Note into 2,882,519 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Novartis Note, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest converted into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to 120% of the 20-day trailing average closing price per share of the common stock immediately prior to the conversion date.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and discovery programs and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for emricasan, crystalline forms of emricasan and certain methods of treatment with emricasan. In addition, we have patent protection covering certain other preclinical stage compounds. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business.
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 19

Our patent portfolio includes patents directed to crystalline forms and methods of use of emricasan. As of December 31, 2018, we have received one United States patent and corresponding foreign patents directed to crystalline forms of emricasan. Foreign patents have been granted in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Europe, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. Additional applications are pending in Hong Kong and Thailand. We expect that the crystalline forms and methods of use patent, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, will expire in 2028 (United States) and 2027 (international). It is possible that the term of a crystalline forms patent in the United States could be extended up to five additional years under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. Patent term extension may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval. In addition, our patent portfolio includes patent applications directed to certain methods of use of emricasan. As of December 31, 2018, we have pending patent applications in the United States and corresponding foreign patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and Thailand for certain methods of use of emricasan, including in patients with liver disease. Our patent portfolio also includes provisional patent applications directed to composition of matter and methods of use for our internally developed caspase inhibitors, including CTS-2090.
 
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Emricasan and any other product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
United States Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | Completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice regulations, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the NDA for filing and review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP, which are regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 20

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, a product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers issues such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some drugs for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the drug may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Phase 2 clinical trials can be further divided into Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials. Phase 2a clinical trials are typically smaller and shorter in duration and generally consist of patient exposure-response trials, which focus on proving the hypothesized mechanism of action. Phase 2b clinical trials are typically higher enrolling and longer in duration and generally consist of patient dose-ranging trials, which focus on finding the optimum dose at which the drug shows clinical benefit with minimal side effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the drug and provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 or post-approval studies: Clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDCA permits the FDA and an IND sponsor to agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of a claim of effectiveness in an NDA. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. An SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the clinical trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. For certain types of protocols, including carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols and Phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim, the FDA has agreed under its performance goals associated with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, to provide a written response on most protocols within 45 days of receipt. However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goals, and additional FDA questions and resolution of issues leading up to an SPA agreement may result in the overall SPA process being much longer, if an agreement is reached at all.
 21

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or data monitoring committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. A trial may also be suspended or terminated based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 FDA Review and Approval Processes
 The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of a drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. The application includes both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical and clinical trials as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a drug or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a drug has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same drug for the non-orphan indication(s).
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant and six months for a priority NDA, if the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the drug is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 22

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the drug within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 If a drug receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the drug. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Following approval of an NDA with a REMS, the sponsor is responsible for marketing the drug in compliance with the REMS and must submit periodic REMS assessments to the FDA.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
 If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines “same drug” as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 We submitted applications for orphan drug designation for emricasan for the treatment of fibrosis in HCV-POLT patients in the United States and the EU. In late 2013, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of POLT patients with reestablished fibrosis in their liver to delay the progression to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the EU, we withdrew the application based on feedback from the applicable regulatory body that emricasan may have efficacy in fibrosis outside of the HCV-POLT patient population. In June 2017, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to our preclinical product candidate IDN-7314 for the treatment of PSC, a disease affecting bile ducts in the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. In October 2017, IDN-7314 received orphan designation in the EU for the treatment of PSC.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended, alone or in combination with one or more drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If a product candidate receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a drug with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. A drug is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for Priority Review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a drug may be eligible for Accelerated Approval. Drugs studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive Accelerated Approval upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the drug.
 The FDA may also accelerate the approval of a designated Breakthrough Therapy, which is a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The sponsor of a Breakthrough Therapy may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND for the drug. If the FDA designates a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy, it must take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
 Fast Track designation, Priority Review, Accelerated Approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. We plan to explore expedited development and review opportunities for emricasan as appropriate for our targeted indications. In February 2016, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the emricasan development program for the treatment of liver cirrhosis caused by NASH.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drugs for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other requirements, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 24

In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates and products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, such as a REMS. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain competing marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, clinical investigations to support new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of any full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 25

Other types of non-patent marketing exclusivity include orphan drug exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act, which may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity as described above, and pediatric exclusivity under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which may add six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month pediatric exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Foreign Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing and any commercial sales, promotion and distribution of our products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB requirements in the United States, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of the 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure: Under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA’s, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops. 
 National authorization procedures: There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
  
• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 26

The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (a) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (b) either (i) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (c) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if the: (a) second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (b) applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (c) applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject in those countries to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. As such, there is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 27

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act to reduce healthcare expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year that, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Fraud and Abuse Laws
 We will also be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and other regulations and enforcement by the federal government as well as the state and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once emricasan or another product candidate developed by us is approved and commercialization of such product candidate begins. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. Violations of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and individual imprisonment. 
Employees
 As of February 26, 2019, we had 31 employees, 30 of whom are full-time, 10 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 17 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 14 of whom were in general and administrative positions. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
