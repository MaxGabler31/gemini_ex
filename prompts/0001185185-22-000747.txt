Item 1. Business
General 



Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. (“Tel,” “TIC” or the “Company”) has been in business since 1947, is a certified small business, and is a leading designer and manufacturer of avionics test and measurement solutions for the global commercial air transport, general aviation, and government/military aerospace and defense markets. The Company designs, manufactures and sells instruments to test and measure, and also calibrates and repairs a wide range of airborne navigation and communication equipment.



The Company’s strategy over the years has been to invest heavily in research and development to design products significantly better than its competition. Our products provide the stimulus and signals necessary for certification, verification, fault finding and diagnosis of airborne military and commercial navigation and communication systems. Our products incorporate high levels of integration by combining more test functions into a single unit, and thereby reducing customer acquisition, training, and life-cycle support costs than legacy systems. The Company offers avionic test sets for:




■ | Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transponders and interrogators.

■ | Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN)
--+--------------------------------


■ | Commercial Air Traffic Control
--+-------------------------------


■ | Navigation

■ | Communication
--+--------------




Tel-Instrument Electronics Corp. an industry leader in developing, producing, selling, and supporting field-tested, rugged avionic flight line (ramp) and maintenance (bench) test sets for demanding military and commercial customers that range in list price from $12,000 to $90,000. Founded in 1947 and based in East Rutherford NJ, Tel-Instrument is an OTCQB listed public company trading under ticker symbol TIKK.



The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. The Company is successfully extending its dominant market position in Mode 5 test sets in the U.S. defense industry to international partners. We believe that we are well positioned as our CRAFT and TS-4530A flight-line test sets have been endorsed by the U.S. military. Internationally, the Company has been very successful in capturing the lion’s share of the Mode 5 test set business with TIC’s T-47/M5 test set being selected by many international customers including: Canada; the U.K.; Japan; South Korea; and Australia. The Company continues to be in the forefront on Mode 5 research and development and has demonstrated test capability for Mode 5 Level 2B, which provides enhanced secure navigation data to military pilots. The U.S. Army has indicated that they plan to move to this new navigation technology in the next several years. This could entail substantial software upgrade revenues for the thousands of TS-4530A test sets sold to the U.S. Army and the U.S.A.F.



TIC is also working with the Navy on an ECP contract to upgrade all of the CRAFT 708 and 719 units in its inventory to remove product obsolescence and make other required software changes. TIC expects to receive a contract this summer from the Navy for engineering design work and the KIT replacement of all of the active components in the fielded CRAFT test sets. This should result in substantial recurring revenue once the design work is completed which is currently estimated at 24 months.



TIC is introducing the SDR/OMNI multi-purpose avionics test set this summer for the commercial and military markets. This will provide Transponder (Modes A, C, and S), ADS-B, and 978 MHz UAT capability as well as communication and navigation test functionality as well as distance to fault measurements. The SDR-Omni product is a game changer in the commercial and military avionics test market as it will allow customers to replace multiple competitive test sets with one unit that is smaller and provides more capabilities at a fraction of the cost. This new technology could provide us with the opportunity to expand out of our relatively narrow avionics test market niche and enter the much larger secure military and homeland security radio test market which is many times the size of our existing avionics test market. The secure military test set market is very large, and we are anticipating several large competitive DOD solicitations to take place in the next several years. The SDR/OMNI is the only test set on the market with full Class 1 military environmental compliance.

TIC is also working with Lockheed Martin (LMCO) on a new MADL test set. TIC was awarded this contract after winning a competitive solicitation. MADL is a secure communications radio for the F-35. This operates in a much higher frequency range than our other test sets and could represent a further diversification out of our core markets. TIC has completed the Test Readiness Review (“TRR”)   and will be commencing environmental and qualification testing this month . It is expected that this product will generate approximately $600k of recurring annual revenues and will position TIC for further development contracts with LMCO.



Company Response to COVID-19



Fiscal year 2022 operations continued to be affected by the ongoing outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) and its variants. While the business is still strong, the Company has been impacted by the pandemic in its commercial business and delays in orders from some of its military customers. The pandemic has also impacted its supply chain and labor force with disruptions to both the delivery of critical inventory components and personnel shortages due to COVID quarantines, which have hampered our ability to ship units under normal lead times



The subsequent spread of COVID-19 to the U.S. and many other parts of the world led the World Health Organization to characterize COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Thereafter, most U.S. states imposed “stay-at-home” orders on their populations to stem the spread of COVID-19. Of specific interest to the Company, stay-at-home orders were imposed in the states of New Jersey and Kansas.



On May 4, 2020, the Company secured a Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”) loan, which, among other things is included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) in the amount of $772,577. TIC qualified for full loan forgiveness on the initial tranche on December 18, 2020. On January 6, 2021, updated PPP guidance outlining program changes to enhance its effectiveness and accessibility was released on in accordance with the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Non-Profits, and Venues Act. This was available to companies that recorded greater than a 25% sales reduction in any quarter compared to the prior year. The Company qualified for this second round of funding and on March 15, 2021, the company secured a Second Draw PPP loan in the amount of $772,577. The Company applied for forgiveness of the Second Draw Loan in accordance with the terms of the PPP Legislation. The Second Draw Loan was fully approved for the forgiveness, including the associated interest on September 17, 2021.



On August 24, 2021, TIC, and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) signed a small business emergency assistance grant agreement in the amount of $20,000. The funds related to the grant were received from the NJEDA on August 30, 2021, and were recognized as other income during fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.



On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced Executive Order 14042 (“Executive Order”) and related initiatives designed to lead the country out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Executive Order includes policies that will require employees of contractors that do business with the federal government to be vaccinated. On September 24, 2021, The Safer Federal Workforce Task Force released COVID-19 vaccine guidance for Federal contractors and subcontractors. According to this guidance, covered employees must be fully vaccinated by December 8, 2021, or at the latest, by the first day of performance on a covered contract, absent the need for a disability or religious accommodation. In addition, covered contractors must follow the CDC’s mask and physical distance requirements for covered contractor employees and visitors. The Executive Order and the guidance apply to any prime contractor or subcontractor that is a party to a “contract or contract-like instrument” that includes a clause incorporating the requirements of the Executive Order. The new clause was applied on October 15, 2021, to only new federal contracts, solicitations, contract extensions and renewals.



On December 7, 2021, the federal court in Georgia issued a preliminary injunction temporarily halting the enforcement of EO 14042 (Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors) for all covered contracts nation-wide. New guidance from OMB also followed suit giving federal agencies input on how to go about non-enforcement provisions until legal challenges have been resolved. The updated guidance will remain applicable despite any change to new or existing court decisions. The new guidance does not impact the Safer Federal Workforce Taskforce Guidance. The vast majority of TIC employees are fully vaccinated, and TIC is preparing for full compliance of the Executive Order should it apply.



The Department of Defense (DoD) also issued a memorandum stating that its contracting officers shall not enforce Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.223-7999, Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors. DoD instructed its contracting officers not to include the DFARS clause in existing contracts, task orders, and delivery orders. In addition, the memo directs that DoD contracting officers shall not include the class deviation clause in new contracts or orders and must not amend existing contracts or orders to incorporate the clause.

Item 1. Business (continued)



General (continued)

We have delivered over 3,520 TS-4530A kits and test sets. We are seeing modest demand from both the U.S. military and international customers, and we continue to explore all opportunities for this market.



T-4530i IFF Test Set



This new test is a software/hardware upgrade of the TS-4530A product. The lead customer for this test is the German military. This unit includes extended life Ni-MH batteries and significantly expanded manual Mode 5 test capability using a seven-year indefinite-delivery-indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract to our European distributor, Muirhead Avionics (“Muirhead”) for T-4530i test sets. In total, TIC has delivered $3.5 million of these test sets to Germany.



Communications/Navigation (“COMM/NAV) Radio Frequency (RF) Avionics Flight line Tester”) (“CRAFT”) (AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719)



The AN/USM-708 multi-purpose test set was developed by the Company in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. The AN/USM-708 large 6.0 inch color LCD screen and surrounding soft-keys and keyboard provides easy and quick access to a multiple of test screens menus, and display options affording single man operation, instant results, and a host of pre-programmed and manually variable parameters to meet the most demanding requirements for testing of airborne avionic and communication equipment.



The AN/USM-708 has been and continues to be a key product for the Company as it represents a new generation technology product. The Company delivered approximately $40 million in orders, representing over 1,200 test sets, for the AN/USM-708 and AN/USM-719 (IFF only) test sets to the U.S. Military. The AN/USM-708 CRAFT unit combines advanced IFF (including Mode 5 encryption technology) navigation, communication, and sonobuoy test capabilities in a portable test set, which will utilize a flexible and expandable digital-signal-processing-based architecture. Both the AN/USM-708 and the AN/USM-719 have been certified by the AIMS Program Office.



TIC is currently working with the Navy on an ECP contract to upgrade all of the CRAFT 708 and 719 units in its inventory to remove product obsolescence and make other required software changes. TIC expects to receive a contract this summer from the Navy for engineering design work and the KIT replacement of all of the active components in the fielded CRAFT test sets. This should result in substantial recurring revenue once the design work is completed which is currently estimated at 24 months.



The joint Strike Fighter (“JSF”) program continues to generate CRAFT orders as this program ramps up production. The Company has already received orders from Lockheed Martin for the AN/USM-708 units, for the JSF Program, totaling approximate $8 million. Sikorsky has also indicated that it will be ordering CRAFT test sets for its new helicopters. The Company also believes it will receive orders from other customers for this product.

New Products



SDR/OMNI/MIL



TIC has spent the last several years developing the SDR/OMNI avionics test set which currently operates in the 1 MHz to 2.2 GHz range. This test set will enter full-rate production this summer. This new test set utilizes true software-designed radio technology that enables it to test all common avionics functions in one 4.5- pound test set, which is half the weight of competitive test sets. The SDR/OMNI has very wide frequency to accommodate new commercial and military waveforms. It utilizes the latest touch screen technology and has the capability to replace all TIC commercial test sets with one handheld product. At less than five pounds, this test set will be the smallest and most rugged test set available in the market with full Class 1 MIL-PRF-28800 environmental compliance including temperature ranges from -40 degrees to +55 degrees centigrade. The U.S. military will need to upgrade thousands of existing communication and navigation test sets over the next several years to address the new frequency and waveform requirements for military radios and we believe the SDR/OMNI is well positioned to capture a large portion of this business. This new technology could provide us with the opportunity to expand out of our relatively narrow avionics test market niche and enter the much larger secure military and homeland security radio test market which is many times the size of our existing avionics test market. The secure military test set market is very large, and we are anticipating several large competitive DOD solicitations to take place in the next several years.

MADL TEST SET



TIC is also working with Lockheed Martin (LMCO) on a new MADL test set. TIC was awarded this contract after winning a competitive solicitation. MADL is a secure communications radio for the F-35. This operates in a much higher frequency range than our other test sets and could represent a further diversification out of our core markets. TIC has completed the TRR and will be commencing environmental and qualification testing this summer. It is expected that this product will generate approximately $600k of recurring annual revenues and will position TIC for further development contracts with LMCO.
Future Prospects



The Company has built a very solid position in the Mode 5 IFF and TACAN test set market. The planned Navy ECP for CRAFT should generate substantial recurring revenues with the KIT upgrade of all of the Navy units and potentially units sold to other customers. We currently have the majority of the Mode 5 IFF flight-line test market and expect to continue to dominate this market segment with our commitment to self-funded research such as adding Mode 5 Level 2B to our T-47/M5 product.



We believe our new SDR/OMNI will do very well in the world-wide commercial avionics market although we are facing new competition from Aeroflex and a Canadian company. This should generate increased market share at very attractive gross margin levels. The real focus for the SDR/OMNI is in the military arena for Nav/Comm testers and communication test sets. This market has been dominated by Aeroflex for the last 30 years and TIC has not had a viable competitive product until now. The SDR/OMNI is ideally suited for these markets as it is the only test set on the market with full Class 1 DOD environmental compliance. The secure military test set market is very large, and we are anticipating several large competitive DOD solicitations to take place in the next several years.



Competition



The general aviation market consists of some 1,000 avionics repair and maintenance service shops at private and commercial airports in the United States that purchase test equipment to assist in the repair of aircraft electronics. The commercial aviation market consists of approximately 80 domestic and foreign commercial airlines.



The civilian market for avionic test equipment has been dominated by Aeroflex Inc., a division of Viavi Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV). They have dominated the commercial market with their IFR 4000 and 6000 test sets which were first introduced in 2004. They have sold thousands of these units over the last 18 years. These are becoming obsolete and will need to be replaced. Aeroflex has recently introduced a new test set called the 10K which combines the two test sets into one unit. A Canadian company, CCX Technologies, has recently introduced a competitive product which appears to be doing well in the market. The SDR/OMNI is smaller, more rugged, and easier to use than these two test sets and we are very optimistic that it will greatly improve our market share.



The military market is large and is dominated by large corporations with substantially greater resources than the Company, including Aeroflex. Tel competitively bids for government contracts based on the engineering quality and innovation of its products, competitive price, and “small business set asides” (i.e., statutory provisions requiring the military to entertain bids only from statutorily defined small businesses), and on bids for sub-contracts from major government suppliers. There are a limited number of competitors who are qualified to bid for “small business set asides.” The military market consists of many independent purchasing agencies and offices. The process of awarding contracts is heavily regulated by the U.S. Department of Defense.



Over the last fifteen years, the Company has won several large, competitively bid contracts from the military and has become the primary supplier for the U.S. Military, as well as the NATO countries, of flight line IFF test equipment. The CRAFT AN/USM-708, CRAFT AN/USM-719, TS-4530A, TS-4530i and TR-47/M5 test sets, discussed previously, involve a new generation of technology, including the next generation of IFF testing, and is expected to enable the Company to continue to be a major supplier of avionics test equipment to the military for years to come. Tel believes its new technology will also allow it to increase sales to the commercial avionics market in the future and expand into the very large secure communication test market.

Marketing and Distribution



Domestic commercial sales are made throughout the U.S. to commercial airlines and general aviation businesses directly or through distributors. There were $2,482,424 in domestic commercial sales in fiscal year 2022 and there was one (1) direct commercial customer who accounted for more than 10% of domestic commercial sales, Aero Express (14%). The Company has one domestic distributor which receives discounts ranging between 16%-20% discount for stocking, selling, and, in some cases, providing product calibration and repairs. The loss of this distributor would not have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operations. Our commercial distributor represented approximately 14% and 5%, respectively, of commercial sales during fiscal years 2022 and 2021.



Marketing to the U.S. Government is made directly by employees of the Company or through independent sales representatives, who receive similar commissions to the commercial distributors. For the years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, sales to the U.S. Government, including shipments through the government’s logistics centers, represented approximately 26% and 38%, respectively, of total sales. For the year ended March 31, 2022, two (2) direct customers represented 20% and 12% of total sales and 25% and 10% of government sales, respectively. Two (2) international distributors represented 13% and 12% of total sales and two (2) represented 16% and 15% of government sales for the year ended March 31, 2022. For the year ended March 31, 2021, two (2) direct customers represented 10% and 33% of total sales and 12% and 39% of government sales, respectively. No international distributor represented 10% of total sales or 10% of government sales for the year ended March 31, 2021.



International sales are made throughout the world to government and commercial customers, directly through American export agents, or through the Company’s overseas distributors at a discount reflecting a 15% to 22% selling commission, under written or oral, year-to-year arrangements. The Company has an exclusive distribution agreement with Muirhead Avionics Ltd (“Muirhead”) and Accessories, Ltd (“Muirhead”), based in the United Kingdom, to represent the Company in parts of Europe, and with Milspec Services in Australia and New Zealand. Tel also sells its products through exclusive distributors in Spain, Portugal, and East Asia and is exploring distribution in other areas. For the years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, total international sales were 37% and 52%, respectively, of sales, the notable decrease is due partially to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Additionally, the Company has an agreement with M.P.G. Instruments s.r.l., based in Italy, wherein this distributor has the exclusive sales rights for DME/P ramp and bench test units. The Company continues to explore additional marketing opportunities in other parts of the world, including East Asia.



The Company has no material assets overseas. Tel also provides customers with calibration and repair services. Repairs and calibrations accounted for 15% and 10% of sales for the years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.



Future domestic market growth, if any, will be affected in part by whether the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) implements additional plans to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system regulations and by continuing recent industry trends towards more sophisticated avionics systems, both of which would require the design and manufacture of new test equipment. Currently, the T-47/M5 has been upgrade for continued support of NATO customers and we continue to develop the Mode 5L2B Flight Line Test. This technology will be supported in our T-47/M5 and T-4530i product lines. Military contracts are awarded and implemented by extensive government regulation. The Company believes its test equipment is recognized by its customers for its quality, durability, reliability, affordability, and by its advanced technology.



Backlog



Set forth below is Tel’s avionics backlog on March 31, 2022, and 2021:




 | Commercial | | Government | | | Total
---------------+------------+---------+------------+---+-----------+------
March 31, 2022 | $ | 275,242 | | $ | 3,216,299 | | $ | 3,491,541
March 31, 2021 | $ | 291,687 | | $ | 7,310,096 | | $ | 7,601,783




Tel believes that most of its backlog on March 31, 2022, will be delivered during the next 12 months. The backlog is pursuant to purchase orders. Historically, the Company obtains orders which are required to be filled in less than 12 months, and therefore, backlog amounts at the end of the period do not reflect delivered or future orders.

Suppliers



TIC obtains its purchased parts from a number of suppliers. In fiscal year 2022, our supply chain had significant issues with deliveries being delayed which negatively impacted TIC’s revenues and profitability. The situation has been slow in improving this calendar year and the Company is placing orders earlier to allow for longer lead times to obtain purchased parts, as needed, at acceptable prices.
Patents and Environmental Laws



TIC has no patents or licenses which are material to its business, and there are no material costs incurred to comply with environmental laws.



Engineering, Research, and Development



In the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, Tel incurred expenses of $2,548,626 and $2,295,901, respectively, on the engineering, research, and development of new and improved products. Engineering, research, and development expenditures in fiscal year 2022 were made primarily for the development of the Company’s SDR/OMNI hand-held product line utilizing CRAFT and TS-4530A technology, the MADL test set for LMCO, and T-4530i, and the incorporation of other product enhancements in existing designs. The Company owns all of these designs with the exception of the AN/ARM-206 product. Tel’s management believes that continued significant expenditures for engineering, research, and development are necessary to enable Tel to expand its products, sales, and profits, and to remain competitive.
Personnel



As of June 16, 2022, Tel had 44 employees, comprised of 20 full-time and 1 part-time employees in manufacturing, supply chain, and quality assurance, 6 full-time and 1 part-time employees in administration and sales, including customer services and product support, and 14 full-time and 2 part-time employees in engineering, research, and development, none of whom belongs to a union. From time to time, the Company also employs independent contractors to support its manufacturing, engineering, and sales organizations. As of June 16, 2022, the Company utilized 2 independent contractors in sales management. Tel has been successful in attracting skilled and experienced management, sales, and engineering personnel, although the market for senior engineering talent is becoming very competitive. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
