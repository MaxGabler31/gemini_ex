​
Overview
​
Tracing its origins back to 1952, Nabors has grown from a small land drilling business in Canada to one of the world’s largest drilling contractors. Today, Nabors owns and operates one of the world’s largest land-based drilling rig fleets and is a provider of offshore rigs in the United States and several international markets. Nabors also provides directional drilling services, tubular running services, performance tools, and innovative technologies for its own rig fleet and those operated by third parties. In today’s performance-driven environment, we believe we are well positioned to seamlessly integrate downhole hardware, surface equipment and software solutions into our AC rig designs. Leveraging our advanced drilling automation capabilities, Nabors’ highly skilled workforce continues to set new standards for operational excellence and transform our industry.
​
Our business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig related services and technologies. These services include tubular running services, wellbore placement solutions, directional drilling, measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”), logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) systems and services, equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation and optimization software. 
​
Our business consists of five reportable segments: U.S. Drilling, Canada Drilling, International Drilling, Drilling Solutions and Rig Technologies. 
​
With operations in approximately 20 countries, we are a global provider of drilling and drilling-related services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells, with a fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment which, as of December 31, 2021 included:
​

● | 301 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States and various countries throughout the world; and

​
U.S. Drilling
​
Operating one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets in the U.S., Nabors continues to drive innovation and integration in the industry. Nabors offers a full suite of options including performance tools and innovations developed by our team of internal engineers who are wholly focused on advanced technologies. We maintain activities in the lower 48 states and Alaska as well as offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Our U.S. fleet consists of 173 AC rigs and 11 SCR land rigs, which were actively marketed as of December 31, 2021. 
​
Since our first AC land rig was built in 2002, we have continued to develop industry-leading breakthroughs. As the industry shifted to multi-well pad drilling, we anticipated the appetite for greater efficiencies and adaptability through batch drilling. As a result, we developed our suite of PACE® drilling rigs. In 2013, we introduced our PACE®-X800 rig equipped with an advanced walking system with multidirectional capabilities that enables the rig to move efficiently over existing wells on a pad. Because the ancillary equipment accompanies the rig, it moves easily between adjacent rows of wells. In 2016, we introduced our PACE®-M800 and PACE®-M1000 rigs which complement our existing PACE®-X800 rigs. The PACE®-M800 rig is designed for lower-density multi-well pads whereas the PACE®-M1000 is designed for higher density pads. Both are designed to move rapidly between pads. Featuring the same advanced walking capabilities as the PACE®-X800 rig, the PACE®-M800 rig can quickly move efficiently on pads and over short distances, with minimal rig-up and rig-down components. 
​
In addition to land drilling operations throughout the lower 48 states and Alaska, we also actively marketed 12 platform rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as of December 31, 2021. 
​
In recent years we have deployed a full suite of technology supporting Nabors and third party rigs. By seizing the opportunity to move forward, faster, Nabors has employed automation to increase safety, instill efficient processes and build agility for our customers. See Drilling Solutions below for more information.
​
Canada Drilling
​
The focus of the Canadian drilling market was almost exclusively on horizontal wells. To align with this market, our Canadian rig fleet was concentrated on larger, more agile rigs. In July 2021, we closed on the sale of our Canada Drilling assets. 
​
International Drilling
​
We conduct activities in major international oil and gas markets, most notably Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Kazakhstan. Many of our rigs are designed to address the challenges of working in specific operating environments, such as desert climates, mountainous regions, and tropical zones.
​
As of December 31, 2021, our international fleet consisted of 116 land-based drilling rigs located in approximately 14 countries. At the same time, we actively marketed 17 platforms rigs in the international offshore drilling markets. In 

5




prior years, we increased the utilization of the PACE®-X800 rigs in international markets through deployments in Latin America.

Both TRS and MPD integrate with the rig, eliminating the need for third party services and thereby improving efficiencies and reducing cost.
​
Rig Technologies
​
Our Rig Technologies segment is primarily comprised of Canrig, which manufactures and sells top drives, catwalks, wrenches, drawworks and other drilling related equipment such as robotic systems and downhole tools which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. Rig Technologies also provides aftermarket sales and services for the installed base of its equipment. 
​
Our Business Strategy
​
Our business strategy is to build shareholder value and enhance our competitive position by:
​

● | achieving superior operational and health, safety and environmental performance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | leveraging our existing global infrastructure and operating reputation to capitalize on growth opportunities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | continuing to develop our existing portfolio of value-added services to our customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | enhancing our technology position and advancing drilling technology both on the rig and downhole; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | achieving financial returns in excess of our cost of capital.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

​
During the past several years we have transformed our fleet in the Lower 48 into what we believe is the most capable, modern fleet in the market. We believe our customer base recognizes the quality of our assets, the competency 

6




of our crews, our industry leading operational performance and the value added by our performance software and our services integration. 
​
We believe our drilling technology portfolio positions us well to address the changing market dynamic both in the United States and internationally. Our technological development efforts drive toward a seamless integration of the rig’s operations with downhole sensing. Additionally, we have added complementary services to our traditional rig offering, in many cases replacing third-party providers of these complementary services as a single service provider. 
​
Drilling Contracts
​
Our drilling contracts are typically daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the dayrate for providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving between drilling locations, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our anticipated costs. A daywork contract differs from a footage contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid on the basis of a rate per foot drilled) and a turnkey contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid for drilling a well to a specified depth for a fixed price). We also offer performance enhancing drilling services, performance software and equipment such as managed pressure services, directional drilling, rotary steering systems and measurement while drilling. These additional products and services are additive to our rig charges.
​
Our contracts for land-based and offshore drilling have durations that are single-well, multi-well or term. Term contracts generally have durations ranging from six months to five years. Under term contracts, our rigs are committed to one customer. Offshore workover projects are often contracted on a single-well basis. We generally receive drilling contracts through competitive bidding, although we occasionally enter into contracts by direct negotiation. Most of our single-well contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice, while multi-well contracts and term contracts may provide us with early termination compensation in certain circumstances. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances the customer may not be obligated, able or willing to make an early termination payment to us. Contract terms and rates differ depending on a variety of factors, including competitive conditions, the geographical area, the geological formation to be drilled, the equipment and services to be supplied, the on-site drilling conditions, and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. 

​
Our Customers
​
Our customers include major international, national and independent oil and gas companies. One customer, Saudi Aramco, accounted for approximately 31%, 29% and 22% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which operating revenues are primarily included in the results of our International Drilling reportable segment. Our contracts with Saudi Aramco are on a per rig basis. These contracts are primarily operated through SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Human Capital
​
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, approximately 7,000 of which are employed internationally. 
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We endeavor to create an environment rich in diversity that welcomes those of all backgrounds, ethnicities and experiences. All told, our employee base represents 75 nationalities. 
​
Traditionally the oil and gas industry has been male dominated. By implementing strategic recruiting efforts, employee development streams and retention practices, we have been able to achieve gender diversity that we believe outpaces not just the industry, but the business world in general. Based on our most recent employee engagement survey performed in late 2020, we learned that:
​

● | 87% of women in our workforce feel supported by their manager;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | 73% of women of color have strong allies on their team; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2021, women made up 20% of the Company’s SG&A and Field Support workforce.  Additionally, women represented 34% of our 2021 new hires.
​
By recognizing disparate voices, we foster a more cohesive, high performing and productive company. 
​
Training and Talent Management
​
We are dedicated to the development and training of our worldwide employee base. Training begins at onboarding, where employees receive job-specific instruction with a focus on safety, corporate ethics and an inclusive workplace. Ongoing training includes a focus on career development and advancement. A key focus is the career development offered to women and employees of color.
​
Educational Assistance
​
In 2009, our former Chairman and CEO, Eugene M. Isenberg, established the Isenberg Education Fund Scholarship Program, the purpose of which is to provide educational assistance to talented, high-achieving individuals who demonstrate strong academic performance and dedicated community service as well as financial need. Aid is available to employees and their family members, including spouses, children and grandchildren. To date, the program has provided over $3.8 million in educational assistance to employees and their families.
​
Health, Welfare and Retirement 
​
We provide employees health and welfare benefits standard for the industry and their location of employment. U.S. employees and their families receive medical, dental and vision insurance, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability coverage, and health and dependent care flexible spending accounts. All U.S. full-time employees also are eligible for a 401(k) plan with a Company match.
​
Seasonality
​
Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. Specifically, our drilling operations in Canada and Alaska generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year, due to the annual spring thaw. In addition, our U.S. offshore market can be impacted during summer months by tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but currently we cannot estimate the degree to which these activities may be affected. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in these operations, but seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business.
​
Industry/Competitive Conditions
​
To a large degree, our businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly and are highly volatile. Relatedly, customers may have difficulty accessing capital markets due to poor historical returns for their investments and due to certain institutional investors choosing not to invest in fossil fuel industries. A decrease or prolonged decline in the price of oil or natural gas or in the exploration, development and production activities of our customers could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors— Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability, and—Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment and Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
​
The markets in which we provide our services are highly competitive. We believe that competitive pricing is a significant factor in determining which service provider is awarded a job in these markets and customers are increasingly sensitive to pricing during periods of market instability. Historically, the number of available rigs and drilling-related 

8




equipment has exceeded demand in many of the markets in which we operate, resulting in strong price competition. This is due in part to the fact that most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in the levels of exploration, development and production activities and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas.
​
Although many rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity, competition has increased based on the supply of existing and new rigs across all our markets. Most available contracts for our services are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price.
​
In addition to price, other competitive factors in the markets we serve are the overall quality of service and safety record, the technical specification and condition of equipment, the availability of skilled personnel and the ability to offer ancillary services. Our drilling business is subject to certain additional competitive factors. For example, we believe our ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features and, in certain international markets, our experience operating in certain environments and strong customer relationships have been significant factors in the selection of Nabors for the provision of drilling services. We expect that the market for our drilling services will continue to be highly competitive. See Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
​
Nabors and companies across the oil and gas value chain have set aggressive decarbonization goals; now the industry needs the tools to achieve them.  In response to these goals, we have a fast-growing portfolio of technologies designed to drive energy efficiency and emissions reductions for the Company and third-party customers.  The line-up includes proprietary emissions reporting and analytics software, engine management controls, energy storage systems, hydrogen injection catalysts, carbon capture technology and fuel enhancing additives, as well as traditional high-line power and dual-fuel offerings, all of which are intended to establish Nabors’ fleet as the cleanest and most efficient in the industry.
​
The global market for drilling and related products and services is competitive. Certain competitors are present in more than one of the markets in which we operate, although no one competitor operates in all such markets. Our strategy combines advanced drilling rig designs – complete with integrated downhole tools, surface equipment, and software – with operational performance, industry-leading safety, and an innovative technology roadmap.
​
Significant competitors in our U.S. Drilling segment include: Helmerich & Payne Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy Inc., Precision Drilling Corp., and Ensign Energy Services Inc. In the U.S. Lower 48 land drilling market, we also compete with numerous smaller or regional drilling contractors. In our International segment, significant competitors with operations in multiple countries include KCA Deutag Drilling Limited, Saipem S.p.A, as well as many contractors with regional or local rig operations.
​
Our Rig Technologies segment competes primarily with National Oilwell Varco Inc., Bentec GmbH, and several smaller rig equipment suppliers. Our Drilling Solutions segment competes with services provided by Baker Hughes Co., Halliburton Co., Schlumberger Ltd., Expro Group Holdings NV, Weatherford International plc., as well as several of our drilling competitors and smaller, specialized service providers.
​
Acquisitions and Divestitures
​
We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. Lower 48, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in major oil and gas markets around the world. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. While we continuously consider and review strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in completing and realizing the expected benefits of such transactions in the future.
​
We may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business if it is strategically or economically advantageous for us to do so. 
​
 In July 2021, we closed on the sale of our Canada Drilling segment assets for approximately $94.0 million. These assets included our fleet of 35 land-based drilling rigs and related equipment and property. This transaction did not 

9




represent a strategic shift in our operations and will not have a major effect on our operations and financial results going forward.
​
Environmental Compliance
​
Sustainability is an essential part of the corporate culture at Nabors and an integral part of our strategic plans. We know that our success is directly linked to implementing and executing a broad range of sustainable practices. Through technological innovation, environmental impact planning, corporate safety initiatives and community relations activities, Nabors understands that how we conduct business is as important as our results. Corporate responsibility guides every aspect of our daily activities and is the key to our continued success.
​
We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental rules and regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2022. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental rules and regulations applicable to our operations, see Part I, Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.
