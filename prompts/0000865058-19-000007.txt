Item 1. Business 
Summary Description of The National Security Group, Inc. 
The National Security Group, Inc. (the Company, NSG, we, us, our), an insurance holding company, was incorporated in Delaware on March 20, 1990. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol NSEC. 
Pursuant to regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are considered a “Smaller Reporting Company” as defined by SEC rules. We have elected to utilize an “a la carte” scaled disclosure which permits smaller reporting companies to elect to comply with scaled financial and non-financial disclosure requirements on an item by item basis. The most significant reporting difference permitted under the scaled disclosures, which we have utilized, is to include two years of audited financial statements. 
The Company, through its three wholly owned subsidiaries, operates in two industry segments: property and casualty (P&C) insurance and life insurance. 
The property and casualty subsidiaries of the Company, National Security Fire and Casualty (NSFC), and Omega One Insurance Company (Omega), primarily write personal lines dwelling coverage including dwelling fire and windstorm, homeowners and mobile homeowners lines of insurance in ten states. Property and casualty insurance is the most significant industry segment, accounting for 90.9% of total premium revenues. 
The Company's life insurance subsidiary, National Security Insurance Company (NSIC), offers a basic line of life and health and accident insurance products in seven states.
The majority of our assets and investments are held in the insurance company subsidiaries. 
The Company's website address is: www.nationalsecuritygroup.com. The “Investors” section of our website (http://investors.nationalsecuritygroup.com/) provides numerous resources for investors seeking additional information about us. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K are made available on our website soon after filing with the SEC. Additionally, stock trades by insiders as filed on Forms 3, 4, and 5 are posted to the website after filing with the SEC. The website also provides information regarding corporate governance, stock quotes and press releases. Investors are encouraged to visit our website for additional information about the Company. 
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Any statement contained in this report which is not a historical fact, or which might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning the Company or its business, whether expressed or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The following report contains forward-looking statements that are not strictly historical and that involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements include any statements containing the words “expect,” “plan,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other words of a similar nature. Management cautions investors about forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve certain evaluation criteria, such as risks, uncertainties, estimates, and/or assumptions made by individuals informed of the Company and industries in which we operate. Any variation in the preceding evaluation criteria could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following:

▪ | The insurance industry is highly competitive and the Company encounters significant competition in all lines of business from other insurance companies. Many of the competing companies have more abundant financial resources than the Company. 


▪ | Insurance is a highly regulated industry. It is possible that legislation may be enacted which would have an adverse effect on the Company's business. 


▪ | The Company is subject to regulation by state governments for each of the states in which it conducts business. The Company cannot predict the subject of any future regulatory initiative(s) or its (their) impact on the Company's business. Company insurance rates are also subject to approval by state insurance departments in each of these states. We are often limited in the level of rate increases we can obtain. 

 3


▪ | The Company is rated by various insurance rating agencies. If a rating is downgraded from its current level by one of these agencies, sales of the Company's products and stock price could be adversely impacted. 


▪ | The Company's financial results are adversely affected by increases in policy claims received by the Company. While a manageable risk, this variance is often unpredictable. 


▪ | The Company's investments are subject to a variety of risks. Investments are subject to defaults and changes in market value. Market value can be affected by changes in interest rates, market performance and the economy. 


▪ | The Company mitigates risk associated with life policies through implementing effective underwriting and reinsurance strategies. These factors mitigate, not eliminate, risk related to mortality and morbidity exposure. The Company has established reserves for claims and future policy benefits based on amounts determined by independent actuaries. There is no assurance that these estimated reserves will prove to be sufficient or that the Company will not incur claims exceeding reserves, which could result in operating losses and loss of capital. 


▪ | The Company mitigates risk associated with property and casualty policies through implementing effective underwriting and reinsurance strategies. The Company obtains reinsurance which increases underwriting capacity and limits the risk associated with policy claims. The Company is subject to credit risk with regard to reinsurers as reinsurance does not alleviate the Company's liability to its insured's for the ceded risks. The Company utilizes a third-party to develop a reinsurance treaty with reinsurers who are reliable and financially stable. However, there is no guarantee that booked reinsurance recoverable will actually be recovered. A reinsurer's insolvency or inability to make payments due could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of the Company. 


▪ | The Company's ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders is contingent upon profitability and capital adequacy of the insurance subsidiaries. The insurance subsidiaries operate under regulatory restrictions that could limit the ability to fund future dividend payments of the Company. An adverse event or series of events could materially impact the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to fund future dividends, and consequently, the Board of Directors would have to suspend the declaration of dividends to shareholders. 


▪ | The Company is subject to the risk of adverse settlements or judgments resulting from litigation of contested claims. It is difficult to predict or quantify the expected results of litigation because the outcome depends on decisions of the court and jury that are based on facts and legal arguments presented at the trial.

Industry Segment and Geographical Area Information
Property and Casualty Insurance Segment
The Company's property and casualty insurance business is conducted through National Security Fire & Casualty Company (NSFC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company organized in 1959, and Omega One Insurance Company (Omega), a wholly owned subsidiary of National Security Fire & Casualty Company organized in 1992. This segment will be referred to throughout this report as NSFC, property-casualty segment or P&C segment. NSFC is licensed to write property and casualty insurance in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, and operates on a surplus lines basis in the state of Louisiana. Omega is licensed to write insurance in Alabama and Louisiana. 
The following table indicates allocation of direct premium written by state for the years ended December 31, 2018 and
2017: 
State | Percent of Direct Written Premium
 | 2018 | | 2017
Alabama | $ | 16,261,000 | | | 26.65 | % | | $ | 16,966,000 | | | 27.59 | %
Arkansas | 1,941,000 | | | 3.18 | % | | 2,086,000 | | | 3.39 | %
Georgia | 9,786,000 | | | 16.04 | % | | 9,172,000 | | | 14.91 | %
Louisiana | 5,178,000 | | | 8.49 | % | | 6,068,000 | | | 9.87 | %
Mississippi | 10,816,000 | | | 17.73 | % | | 10,808,000 | | | 17.58 | %
Oklahoma | 6,828,000 | | | 11.19 | % | | 6,580,000 | | | 10.70 | %
South Carolina | 6,793,000 | | | 11.14 | % | | 6,477,000 | | | 10.53 | %

 | $ | 61,007,000 | | | 100.00 | % | | $ | 61,498,000 | | | 100.00 | %

In general, the property-casualty insurance business involves the transfer by the insured, to an insurance company of all or a portion of certain risks for the payment, by the insured, of a premium to the insurance company. A portion of such risks is often retained by the insured in the form of deductibles, which vary from policy to policy, but are typically in the range of $500 to $1,000 on dwelling property and homeowners lines of business.
The premiums or payments to be made by the insured for insurance policies of the property and casualty subsidiaries are based upon expected costs of providing benefits, underwriting and administering the policies. In determining the premium to be charged, the property and casualty subsidiaries utilize data from past claims experience, modeled catastrophe losses and anticipated claims estimates along with catastrophe reinsurance cost, commissions, taxes and general expenses. 
The operating results of the property-casualty insurance industry are subject to significant fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year. These fluctuations are often due to the effect of competition on pricing, unpredictable losses incurred in connection with weather-related and other catastrophic events, general economic conditions and other factors, such as changes in tax laws and the regulatory environment.
The following table sets forth the premiums earned (net of reinsurance) during the periods reported for the property and casualty insurance segment:

Property and Casualty Loss Reserves
Our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves to cover their ultimate liability for losses and adjustment expenses. Our staff periodically conducts reviews throughout the year of projected loss development information in order to adjust estimates. The liability for loss and adjustment expense reserves consists of an estimated liability for the ultimate settlement of claims that have been reported as well as an estimate of loss and adjustment expenses for incurred claims that have not yet been reported (IBNR). IBNR estimates are based primarily on historical development patterns using quantitative data generated from statistical information and qualitative analysis of legal developments, economic conditions and development caused by events deemed to be infrequent in occurrence. The reserves are based on an estimate made by management. Management estimates are based on an analysis of historical paid and incurred loss development patterns for the ten prior loss years. Prior year period-to-period loss development factors are applied to latest reported loss reserve estimates in order to estimate the ultimate incurred losses for each given loss year. The amount of loss reserves estimated in excess of current reported case losses are recorded as IBNR reserves.
In addition to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for specific claims, both reported and unreported, we establish reserves for loss adjustment expenses that are not attributable to specific claims. These reserves consist of estimates for Defense and Cost Containment (DCC) and Adjusting and Other Expenses (AO). These reserves are established for the estimated expenses of internal claims staff and the cost of outside experts, such as attorneys representing our interest, in the final settlement of incurred claims that are still in process of settlement. We conduct annual and interim reviews over the course of each year in order to insure that no significant changes have occurred in our loss development that might adversely impact our loss reserving methodology. 
The following loss reserve re-estimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last 10 calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows retroactive re-estimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year. These re-estimates are the result of the Company's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The third section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that year's reserve liability. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserve to the reserve originally established and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The Loss Reserve Re-estimates table is cumulative, and therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. 
While the information in the table provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses established in previous years, it should not be assumed to be predictive of redundancies or deficiencies on current year unpaid losses in future periods. Company management believes that the reserves established at the end of 2018 are adequate. However, due to inherent uncertainties in the loss reserve estimation process, management cannot guarantee that current year reserve balances will prove to be adequate. Due to the relatively short tail nature of the property and casualty subsidiaries' claim liabilities, the Company does not discount loss reserves for the time value of money. Dollar amounts in the following table are in thousands.

Our reported results, financial position and liquidity could be affected by changes in key assumptions that determine our loss reserves. The table below illustrates the change to equity that would occur as a result of a change in loss reserves and reserves for loss adjustment expense:

10.0% | 9,029 | | (1.79)% | | 7,782 | | (1.48)%

While our reserve estimates have had more significant variability in the past, we believe that the scenarios presented above are most reasonable as our methodology has become more seasoned, and we have maintained continuity of staff involved in the reserving process.
Life Insurance Segment
National Security Insurance Company (NSIC), a wholly owned subsidiary organized in 1947, conducts the Company's life insurance business. This segment will be referred to throughout this report as NSIC, Life Company, or Life segment. NSIC is licensed to write insurance in seven states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.

The following table indicates NSIC's percentage of direct premiums collected by state for the two years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

State | Percentage of Total Direct Premiums
 | 2018 | | 2017
Alabama | $ | 3,538,000 | | | 57.37 | % | | $ | 3,616,000 | | | 57.96 | %

 | $ | 6,167,000 | | | 100.00 | % | | $ | 6,239,000 | | | 100.00 | %

NSIC has two primary methods of distribution of insurance products: independent agents and home service (career) agents.  The independent agent distribution method accounts for 66.9% of total premium revenue in the life insurance segment. Approximately 200 of the Company's independent agents produced new business during 2018. The home service distribution method of life insurance products accounts for 28.2% of total premium revenue in the life insurance segment. Home service life products consist of products marketed directly at the home or other premises of the insured by an employee agent.  The Company employed three career agents and one regional manager as of December 31, 2018. The remaining 4.9% of premium revenue consists of the following:  a book of business acquired from a state guaranty association in 2000 (0.1%), premium generated through direct sales of school accident insurance (4.4%), and other miscellaneous business serviced directly through the home office (0.4%). 
NSIC's primary products are life insurance, primarily whole life, and health and accident insurance. NSIC does not sell annuities, interest sensitive whole life or universal life insurance products.  Term life insurance policies provide death benefits if the insured's death occurs during the specific premium paying term of the policy.  The policies generally do not provide a savings or investment element included as part of the policy premium.  Whole-life insurance policies demand a higher premium than term life, but provide death benefits which are payable under effective policies regardless of the time of the insured's death and have a savings and investment element which may result in the accumulation of a cash surrender value.  Our accident and health insurance policies provide coverage for losses sustained through sickness or accident and include individual hospitalization and accident policies, group supplementary health policies, and specialty products, such as cancer policies.  Our line of health and accident products feature specified fixed benefits, so rapidly rising health care costs do not have as great an impact on our health and accident line as they do on comparable products offered by other companies.  
The following table displays a schedule of 2018 life segment premium produced by product and distribution method:

Life Insurance Segment Reserves 
We engage Wakely Actuarial Services of Palm Harbor, Florida as consulting actuary to calculate our reserves for traditional life insurance products. The methodology used requires that the present value of future benefits to be paid under life insurance policies less the present value of future net premiums be calculated. The calculation uses assumptions including estimates of any adverse deviation, investment yields and changes in investment yields, mortality, maintenance expenses and any non-forfeiture options or termination benefits. The assumptions determine the level and sufficiency of reserves which are calculated and reviewed by our consulting actuary at the end of each quarter. The independent consulting actuary also reviews our estimates for other insurance products including claims reserves under accident and health contracts. Management believes that the reserve amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate. 
Investments
A significant percentage of the total income for the Company is tied to the performance of our investments. Assets that will eventually be used to pay reserve liabilities and other policyholder obligations, along with our capital, are invested to generate investment income while held by the Company. Our investment income is comprised primarily of interest and dividend income on fixed maturity securities and equity securities along with capital gains/losses generated by these investment securities. At December 31, 2018, cash and investments comprise 82% of total assets, and investment income (including realized losses) comprises 5.5% of total revenue evidencing the significant impact investments can have on financial results. Because our insurance subsidiaries are regulated as to the types of investments they may make and the amount of funds they may maintain in any one type of investment, the Company has developed a conservative value oriented investment philosophy, in order to meet regulatory requirements. The Company's investment goals are to conserve capital resources and assets, obtain the necessary investment income threshold to meet reserves, and provide a reasonable return. Current yield from invested assets and capital appreciation of investments create this return. 
Marketing and Distribution
As mentioned earlier in this report, NSIC products are marketed through a field force of agents who are employees of the Life Company and through a network of independent agents. The Company's use of independent agents is expected to be more cost effective in the long term and has become our primary method of distribution. In an effort to boost productivity and better educate agents on the products and services of NSIC, we have field marketing representatives that travel throughout our service areas holding training sessions for agents. 
P&C products are marketed through a network of independent agents and brokers, who are independent contractors and generally maintain relationships with one or more competing insurance companies. NSFC employs field marketing representatives who visit in the offices of our independent agents regularly to give the agents opportunities for feedback. Our NSFC marketing representatives also host training seminars throughout our service areas. The goal of these seminars is to educate the independent agent sales force about our products and services.

Agents receive compensation for their sales efforts. In the case of life insurance agents, compensation is paid in the form of sales commissions plus a servicing commission. Commissions paid by the Life segment in 2018 averaged approximately 10.4% of premiums and are generally higher for new business production and decline each year at subsequent renewals. Commission rates paid by the P&C segment in 2018 averaged approximately 15% of premiums on both new and renewal business. During 2018, no independent agent, accounted for more than 10% of total net earned premium of the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries. The net earned premium from the largest general agent totaled $4,818,000 or 8.8% of total P&C segment net earned premium. NSFC also offers a “profit sharing bonus plan” to independent agents in order to promote better field underwriting and encourage retention of profitable business. This plan not only rewards our agents but also enhances profitability by giving the agent a vested interest in our success and also aids in maintaining price stability for all our customers as agents have a financial incentive to use good field underwriting practices when completing an application for insurance.
At December 31, 2018, NSIC employed three career agents and one regional manager. NSIC also had approximately 200 independent agents actively producing new business in seven states. At December 31, 2018, NSFC had contracts with approximately 1,700 independent agencies in eight states.
Competition
In both of our insurance segments, we operate in a very competitive environment. There are numerous insurance companies competing in the various states in which we offer our products. Many of the companies with which we compete are much larger, have significantly larger volumes of business, offer much broader ranges of products and have more significant financial resources than we do. We compete directly with many of these companies, not only in the sale of products to consumers, but also in the recruitment and retention of qualified agents. We believe the main areas in which a smaller company, like us, can compete is in the areas of providing niche products in under-served areas of the insurance market at competitive prices while providing excellent service to our agents and policyholders during the entire insurance product life cycle from policy issuance to final payment of a claim. We pride ourselves on being accessible to our independent agent force and maintain a presence through the efforts of a field marketing staff and easy access to home office staff. We believe we have made significant advancements in developing a competitive advantage for our niche products. We also have longstanding relationships with many of our agents. We believe we compete effectively within the markets we serve and continue to evolve our processes and procedures in order to garner further competitive advantages.
NSFC's primary insurance products are dwelling fire and homeowners, including mobile homeowners. Dwelling fire and homeowners are collectively referred to as the dwelling property line of business. We focus on providing niche insurance products within the markets we serve. We are in the top twenty-five dwelling property insurance carriers in our two largest states, Alabama and Mississippi. However, due to the large concentration of business among the top five carriers, our total market share in the dwelling fire line of business is approximately 2.6% in Alabama and 1.6% in Mississippi. In the homeowners line of business, our market share in both Alabama and Mississippi is less than 1%. The homeowners markets are even more concentrated with the top three homeowners carriers in both Alabama and Mississippi controlling nearly 50% of the market.
We have actively sought competitive advantages over the last decade in the area of technological advancement. The property and casualty administration system is an internally developed end-to-end system that we believe enhances our ability to compete with larger carriers in the markets we serve. The system features a web based portal that allows our independent agents to rate, quote and issue policies directly in their office. The system streamlines the underwriting process with automation of many previous manual processes and enhances our agents' ability to provide excellent service to their clients. The system also enhances the efficiency of our underwriting process allowing for a more thorough evaluation of risks. 
Our property and casualty claims administration system automates processes and workflows throughout the claims process and provides a single view of the activity that has occurred on a claim.  The system also has an adjuster web portal, which allows adjusters to view policy limits, see reserve history and policy information, and view prior claims and loss history.  Communications between adjusters and examiners are centralized on the web portal allowing for any messages to be viewed securely as part of the claims history.  Computerized issuance of field checks by staff adjusters was also implemented enforcing reserve and policy limits while reducing the error rates of the previously used hand written checks issued in the field. 
Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are directly regulated by the insurance department in our state of domicile, Alabama. We are subject to the Alabama Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and report to the Alabama Department

of Insurance. Consequently, we are subject to periodic examination and regulation under Alabama Insurance Laws. We underwent our latest periodic regulatory examination which concluded in 2015 with no material issues noted and no financial adjustments made as a result of the examination. The Alabama Department of Insurance is expected to commence a periodic examination of our insurance subsidiaries in 2019.
Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to licensing and supervision by the various governmental agencies in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The nature and extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in state statutes which bestow regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to State Insurance Commissioners and their respective insurance departments. The regulations may require the Company to meet and maintain standards of solvency, comply with licensing requirements, periodically examine market conditions and financial activities and report on the condition of operations and finances. In addition, most of our insurance rates are subject to regulation and approval by regulatory authorities within the respective states in which we offer our products. 
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various statutory restrictions and limitations relating to the payment of dividends or distributions to stockholders. The restrictions are generally based on certain levels of surplus, net income or operating income as determined by statutory accounting practices. Alabama law permits dividends in any year which, together with other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, do not exceed the greater of (1) 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or (2) for property and casualty insurers, statutory net income for the preceding year or for life companies, statutory net gain from operations for the preceding year. Dividends in excess of the restricted amounts are payable only after obtaining expressed regulatory approval. Future dividends from the insurance subsidiaries may be limited by business or regulatory considerations. The Company relies insurance subsidiary dividends to fund stockholder dividends and for payment of most operating expenses of the holding company, including interest and principal payments on debt. Further discussion of dividend payment capacity of subsidiaries can be found in Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These requirements direct our insurance companies to calculate and report information according to a risk based formula which attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risk in our product mix and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow state insurance regulators to identify companies that are potentially inadequately capitalized. Under the formula, the Company calculates Risk Based Capital (RBC) by taking into account certain risks inherent in an insurer's assets, including investments and an insurer's liabilities. Risk based capital rules provide for different levels of action depending on the ratio of a company's total adjusted capital to its “authorized control level” RBC. Based on calculations made by each of our insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2018, each subsidiary exceeds any levels that would require regulatory actions.

Employees
The Company itself has no management or operational employees. Instead, all human resource activities are within the subsidiary National Security Insurance Company. NSIC employed 81 staff members as of December 31, 2018, none of which were represented by a labor union. The Company and its property and casualty subsidiary have a Management Service Agreement (“Agreement”) with National Security Insurance Company whereby the property and casualty subsidiaries reimburse NSIC for salaries and expenses of employees provided under the Agreement. Involved are employees in the areas of Underwriting, Customer Service, Policy Services, Accounting, Marketing, Administration, Document Management, Data Processing, Programming, Personnel, Claims, and Management. We consider our employee relations to be good.
