Item 1. Business
Hostess - Who We Are
We are a leading packaged food company whose brands date back to 1919, when the Hostess® CupCake was introduced, followed by Twinkies® in 1930. Our strategic vision is to be an iconic branded baking company that builds brands and categories to delight our consumers and customers. We seek to leverage our differentiated core competencies of strong brand equity, low cost operating model, collaborative customer partnerships, nimble innovation and significant cash flows to drive profitable growth by engaging consumers with our sweet baked goods while while seeking opportunities in adjacent bakery categories. 
Our brands represented 18.0% of the Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-week ended December 29, 2018. We believe our strong brand history and market position in the SBG category combined with our entrepreneurial spirit provide an unparalleled platform to execute our strategic initiatives. 
We have invested significantly to upgrade our manufacturing footprint, implement new IT systems and enhance production efficiency through the installation of automated baking and packaging lines. These investments, combined with our Direct-to-Warehouse (“DTW”) distribution model, have re-established our leading, premium brand position within the $6.6 billion U.S. SBG category and have increased our distribution channels and paved new growth opportunities for the Company.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for Direct-Store-Delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers, which has allowed us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels (e.g., further penetration into convenience, drug store, dollar, foodservice, and cash & carry). We have both renewed and added relationships with retailers and distributors around the country.
Brands and Products
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. In 2019, we are celebrating our 100 year anniversary of the launch of our first cupcake and have been building our brands ever since. In May 2016, we acquired the Superior on Main® brands and in February 2018, we acquired the Cloverhill® and Big Texas® brands. We offer a variety of new and classic treats under these brands. The following is a summary of our principal product lines:

Our Growth Strategy
We are executing our growth strategy by optimizing our core brands within SBG and expanding into adjacent categories through innovation, leveraging our highly efficient and profitable business model and executing strategic acquisition opportunities while effectively managing our capital structure.
Optimize the core Hostess Brand and expand into adjacent categories 
We believe that we have maintained the Hostess brand power and category awareness for nearly a century by satisfying consumers’ need for fun, light-hearted treats. We believe our portfolio of highly recognized products is synonymous with American snacking. We have established our leadership position in the SBG segment through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting a brand that unites our loyal consumer base and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. 
We plan to capitalize on the strength of the Hostess® brand and our attractive retailer economics in order to drive growth by attracting new consumers and increasing the number of stores carrying our products. With the potential afforded by the extended reach of our DTW distribution model, distribution and market share gains are expected to come from traditional channels (“core expansion”) through our investment in quality, targeted marketing, product renovation and a focus on our most effective brands and SKUs. Our top 7 brands represented 67.0% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2018 and 80% of our market share for the 52-weeks ending December 29, 2018.
Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking. By expanding points of distribution and increasing SKU assortments we plan to continue top line growth in the future. Our top three products (Donettes®, Twinkies® and Cupcakes) have All Commodity Volume (“ACV”) distribution rates in core channels that are significantly higher than the average rate achieved by other products in our portfolio (based on Nielsen 52 weeks ending December 29, 2018). These high levels are directly correlated to our focused approach on our strategic initiatives. By applying this tailored and focused approach to our other existing product lines, we will work with retailers to expand the average number of SKUs offered and attempt to reduce distribution gaps. The average number of products selling at core retailers today is approximately 23 items.
Innovation
Innovation is key to fueling our growth. We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing them in order to stay relevant with our consumer base and attract new consumers. We believe that to support our premium position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. We are focused on continuing to innovate and expand our core products by launching new flavors of iconic products to leverage the brand’s power and drive incremental revenue with new limited time offer products.The success of our product innovation is in part driven by understanding consumer preferences, providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. 
We have developed new innovation to attract new consumers, such as our Hostess Bakery Petite®, a premium snacking platform made with no artificial flavors or colors or high fructose corn syrup. We believe there is growth potential in providing further snacking options for ingredient conscious consumers. We are also expanding the Hostess® brands into new consumer segments to drive incremental growth. During 2018, we launched our Totally Nutty®, a peanut butter wafer bar which expands our presence in the cookie/wafer sub-category within the SBG Category. 
The breakfast sub-category is also a significant opportunity for us where our share is 16.5%, nearly a 3.0% share gap compared to our All Day Snacking share. This sub-category represents approximately 48.7% of the $6.6 billion SBG category according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. According to a July 2016 study by Mintel, convenience and brand preference continue to influence snack selection, as over half of U.S. consumers rate portability as a key attribute in breakfast items. These consumption trends play to our strengths as our products conveniently come packaged in both single-serve and multipack varieties. Our recent acquisition of the Cloverhill® business in Chicago enables us to leverage our current platform and to expand our breakfast capabilities in this significant 
5

consumer segment. In 2018, we launched a line of Hostess® branded multipack danishes and glazed Jumbo Donettes® and have more products on the horizon as we leverage our newly acquired capabilities to expand our breakfast offerings. 
The in-store bakery sections of grocery and club retailers are increasingly utilized to provide a differentiated shopping experience and to showcase product offerings. Our Superior on Main® brand includes eclairs, madeleines, brownies, and iced cookies, as well as preservative-free and gluten-free products offered in the in-store bakery section.We continue to penetrate in-store bakery in the grocery and club channels. Our ISB focus is on core product support and seasonality-relevant core extensions by leveraging the Superior on Main® and Private Label market presence and product offerings. 
We have had early success with licensing opportunities and are continuing to launch new partnerships which leverage our iconic brands. Our products are also distributed by third parties internationally, including products packed specifically for Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada. Our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms.
We also understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the tradition and offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We continue to invest in new product development and building our long-term pipeline, leveraging our innovation pipeline and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion. 
Leverage highly efficient and profitable business model.
When we relaunched the Company, we set out to disrupt the status quo business model of the SBG category. We established our innovative DTW distribution model and heavily invested in our bakeries, which has resulted in energy, labor and time savings, along with the ability to achieve quality products. These investments paved the way for new product innovation. 
The DTW model, uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers. Each distribution center is owned and operated by third parties. The distribution centers are able to fill customer orders and reduce inventory on hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. Products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. A small number of our customers pick up their orders directly from our distribution centers.
The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our fresh bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain retailers.
We believe our DTW distribution model has created a substantial whitespace opportunity. We have greater access to convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Historically, DSD snack cake companies have competed with candy and tobacco distributors; however, our DTW model has enabled us to partner with these third-party distributors who can profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. In 2018, convenience and drug stores accounted for 30.4% of our net revenues. We have established a strong presence and market share in the convenience and drug channels and are focused on continuously expanding coverage. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward.
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of retail sales in the SBG category, which makes prominent in-store placement an essential growth lever. The DTW and centralized distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugate displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, produced economically, and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load, thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit the retailer and us alike. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our brand marketing, which allows us to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which is predominantly DSD-served.

Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities, and offers retailers attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We have invested nearly $250 million in the business since the re-launch in 2013 and anticipate continued investment in the business to further our strategic initiatives. Our capital investment focus will be on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. 
Platform for future acquisitions
We believe we serve as a platform for growth through acquisitions. Within the fragmented consumer packaged goods market, there exists the opportunity to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, platform, infrastructure and performance-driven management culture. We are committed to seeking-out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The 2018 acquisition and integration of the Cloverhill® business in Chicago, IL, is an example where we are leveraging our warehouse model and expanding our breakfast capabilities. The transformation and significant capital investment we have made in this facility has provided us with a platform to leverage our brand in the breakfast sub-category. As we explore other opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage our existing brands or reinvigorate acquired brands within the Baking category. We will also consider our ability to integrate the acquisition with our existing SBG business and the opportunities to generate synergies through production on our existing assets and leveraging of our warehouse model. 
We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to consider both small and large acquisitions in the future and to integrate them in a seamless fashion.
The Category: Large and Attractive
Nearly all U.S. consumers eat snacks at least once per day. The U.S. SBG category is one of the largest categories within the broader $74 billion U.S. Total Snack category, with estimated retail sales of $6.6 billion in 2018 according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 29, 2018. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes, and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars, brownies, blondies, and cookies). According to The Nielsen Company, the Sweet Snacks category (Candy, Cookies, Desserts, Fruit Snacks, and SBG) accounted for 50% of the Total Snacks category dollars. 
Since its reintroduction to the market in 2013, the Hostess® brand has contributed significantly to the total growth of the SBG category. During the Hostess® brand’s hiatus from 2012 to 2013 the category declined by 8%. From the reintroduction of Hostess® through December 31, 2018, the SBG category has grown 15%. 
During 2018, point of sale for our combined brands grew $14.8 million representing 70.5% of total category growth. Our combined brand’s 18.0% share of the category represents an opportunity for continued growth in comparison to its pre-hiatus share of 22.8%. 
Competitive landscape
Hostess® is #2 in the U.S. SBG category. The top three brands, Hostess, Little Debbie, and Entenmanns account for 62% of the SBG retail sales according to Nielsen, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration in the category (3.9% market share vs. 17.4% for overall packaged food), consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment are required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, providing additional barriers to entry.

We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators, supermarket chains with their own private label brands, and grocery stores with their own in-store bakery departments. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, customer service, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Grupo Bimbo, S.A. and McKee Foods Corporation. In addition, we also compete with regional sweet goods branded manufacturers and other companies, including in the ISB space, that produce cookies, candies and other sweet snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain of our markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products which helps mitigate this impact.
Seasonality
Sweet baked goods revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue and continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns.
Production
We produce Hostess®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill® and Big Texas® products at four bakeries located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Chicago, Illinois. In-store bakery products are produced at two bakeries located in Southbridge, Massachusetts. We have invested heavily in baking and packaging technology to improve productivity and efficiency, including installing two Auto-bake systems and fully-automated packaging systems. A portion of our products are co-manufactured and packaged under our brands and sold through our distribution facilities.
Our state of the art Auto-bake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. We have also invested in our Auto-bake lines, equipment that fully-automates the packaging process (from wrapping to palletizing). 
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for various raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to increase or decrease over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials. We have multiple vendors that meet our supply requirements for the sole sourced materials, except in the case of the enzymes used in our ESL technology. With respect to the enzymes, we continue to evaluate other sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility.
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2018 accounted for 58.6% of total net revenue. During 2018, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and affiliates, represented 21.0% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2018 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers and distributors, convenience, drug and dollar store.

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess®, Dolly Madison®, Cloverhill®, and Big Texas® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforce our consumers’ favorable perception of our products. This value provides us the opportunity to sell our products at premium price points and pursue licensing opportunities.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis. We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to enhancing and expanding our product lines, responding to changing consumer preferences and trends and continuing to enhance the taste of our products. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our high standards of quality and specifications. Finally, this department is charged with developing processes to reduce our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, hazard analysis and risk-based preventative controls, food labeling, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. We take compliance and the safety of our products seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Experienced Team
