Market Overview
 
U.S. Mail Trucking
 
In 2014, the USPS announced that it intends to drastically reduce their supplier base from over 4,000 contractors to less than 1,000 by 2022. As part of this consolidation effort, the USPS began implementing the Dynamic Route Optimization (“DRO”) program, which is designed to manage fewer relationships and work with larger prime contractors who also prioritize alternative energy transportation options. As a result, it is estimated that over $1 billion in DRO contracts will come available over the next five years.
CNG Fueling Stations
 
Management believes that there is an immediate opportunity to capture market share in the growing U.S. natural gas vehicle fueling market by repositioning its own fleet of CNG trucks near its company owned CNG stations and seeking trucking company acquisitions or alliances with other CNG users operating near its CNG stations. According to the United States Department of Energy, in December 2018, natural gas was selling at retail in the United States at approximately $2.19 per gas gallon equivalent (“GGE”) while gasoline and diesel were selling for approximately $2.27 and $2.98 per gallon, respectively. Management expects this disparity to remain intact for the foreseeable future, which would create a strong economic incentive for vehicle operators to switch to CNG. In addition, CNG is a significantly cleaner fuel than is gasoline or diesel and creates less engine wear, thereby making its use even more desirable. Natural Gas Vehicles of America (“NGV America”) estimates that as of December 2018, there were approximately 1,700 natural gas fueling stations, with 175,000 natural gas vehicles, including commercial vehicles in the United States.
Competition
 
The U.S. mail trucking industry is estimated to represent an approximately $5 billion subset of the broader transportation market. The USPS trucking industry is highly competitive and fragmented. In 2014, the USPS had active contracts with over 4,000 transportation contractors, and it has publicly announced that its goal is to reduce that number to below 1,000 by 2022. As a result, the Company estimates that over $1 billion in DRO contracts will come available over the next five years. While this will provide additional opportunities for the Company to win new contracts, it may also expose the Company to additional risk of loss on existing contracts as they come up for renewal.
 
The Company competes primarily with other transportation companies for DRO contracts with the USPS. We also compete with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors and management employees. A number of the Company’s competitors have greater financial resources than it does. Additionally, the USPS typically renews contracts with incumbent service providers if appropriate services have been performed, which could limit the Company’s ability to win new USPS contracts. The Company believes that the principal differentiating factors in its business, relative to competition, are service, efficiency, pricing, and its focus on CNG equipment, which aligns with the USPS’s stated preference for contractors who prioritize alternative energy options. Additionally, the Company was an early adopter of the DRO program with the USPS. The existing relationship with the USPS and experience with the DRO program, provides the Company an additional competitive advantage when bidding on these contracts.
 
The vehicle fuels market is highly competitive and in a state of rapid development. As a smaller provider of alternative vehicle fuels, we face numerous barriers to market entry. We compete directly with other operators of CNG fueling stations and indirectly with gasoline, diesel and other alternative vehicle fuels markets, including, but not limited to ethanol, biodiesel, LNG, hydrogen, hybrid and electric vehicle markets. Gasoline and diesel producers and providers own a vast majority of the market share of the vehicle fuels industry. New developments and improvements to existing technologies continue to create volatility in the alternative fuels’ markets. Many of our competitors in the gasoline, diesel, and alternative fuels industries have access to greater financial and other resources than the Company. Demand for natural gas in the vehicle fuels industry is subject to price considerations, reliability, availability, convenience and accessibility, environmental considerations, government incentive programs, and safety considerations, among other factors.
 
We compete directly with both private and public operators of CNG fueling stations. The private market for CNG fueling solutions is currently served by a few larger operators and a number of smaller operators with a few stations. The following are the primary competitors of EVO Inc. serving the CNG market:
 

● | Large competitors, including Clean Energy, TruStar, Love’s Travel Stops (formerly Trillium), and U.S. Gain; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller competitors, including CNG 4 America, Questar Fueling, Clean N’ Green, IGS CNG Services, Freedom CNG, Sparq, and Piedmont Natural Gas; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Public operators of CNG fueling stations, including state and local governments. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategy
 
Our goal is to create a significant and strategically well-positioned national organization which meets the evolving needs of the USPS, enabling us to capture substantial market share in this industry. The Company competitively bids on transportation contracts that detail the movement of mail between processing facilities, destination post offices and destination mailing addresses. Customer contracts are long term in nature, typically with four-year terms and often are renewed to the incumbent if appropriate service has been performed. Contracts are bid and performed in accordance with all contract requirements including, but not limited to Service Contract Act requirements, DOT regulations (federal and state), and all other applicable local and state regulations.

Another aspect of our strategy is to increase utilization of our company owned CNG stations by acquiring trucking companies and developing transit lanes utilizing CNG trucks near our CNG stations. Since January 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sheehy Mail of Waterloo, Wisconsin, which operates the largest fleet of CNG trucks servicing the USPS. We also completed the acquisition of Ursa Major in 2019, which is based one mile from our Oak Creek CNG station and secured freight contracts from Phoenix to Los Angeles which can utilize the Tolleson, Arizona station and eventually the Jurupa Valley, California station.
 
Our Target Customers
 
The USPS is our primary target customer in the trucking industry.
 
In the CNG industry, we target corporate and government fleet customers in addition to generating our own demand with our company owned CNG fleet and further business development efforts for transit lanes near our stations or trucking acquisitions. We believe that fleet operators with vehicles that run the same or similar routes each day (such as mail haulers or point to point freight routes) benefit most immediately from the economic advantages available through CNG usage.
Tax Rebate Opportunity
 
Historically, the federal government offered AFTC enabling the Company to receive a tax credit of $0.50 per GGE of CNG sold for vehicle fuel use. The AFTC was first offered on October 1, 2006 and expired December 31, 2016. It was reinstated for 2017 and Congress is currently reviewing proposed legislation that would retroactively extend the tax provisions through 2019. Although, we previously availed ourselves of the AFTC, our business is not dependent on tax credits, grants, or other incentives from federal, state or local governments. However, when available, we plan to actively pursue federal and state tax credits and other incentives to lower development and operating costs.
Principal Customers and Suppliers
 
Trucking

The USPS is the Company’s primary trucking customer, and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the USPS accounted for approximately 95% and 0%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue. As a result, the Company’s trucking operations are highly dependent on the USPS. The loss of the USPS as a customer or a significant reduction in the Company’s relationship with the USPS would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
CNG
 
The Company historically has targeted high-volume fleet operators to serve as anchor customers at the stations. Once an anchor-customer relationship has been established, we typically seek to minimize construction and sourcing costs by tapping into existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure to supply the customer’s CNG needs. Consequently, we often have a principal customer at our CNG fueling stations. The Company is focusing on generating CNG volume at our stations by repositioning our company owned CNG trucks near our stations that are along trucking routes we serve rather than through additional station expansion.
 
EAF Tolleson. EAF entered into an incremental natural gas facilities agreement dated February 24, 2014 with Southwest Gas Corporation (“Southwest Gas”). Under the terms of the agreement, Southwest Gas agreed to install a pipeline connecting the station to its existing infrastructure at no upfront cost to EAF, and EAF agreed to use Southwest Gas to transport natural gas to the station through its infrastructure. The term was originally five years but has since been modified to ten years. Each year of the ten-year term, EAF is required to make a payment to Southwest Gas equal to $70,565 minus the amount of delivery and demand charges paid by EAF during the applicable contract year. EAF is required to provide financial security in the form of a letter of credit originally in the amount of $510,763, which amount may decrease annually during the term of the agreement and was equal to $306,458 as of December 31, 2018, and 2017.

EAF Oak Creek. EAF entered into a fuel purchase agreement dated January 11, 2013 with Sheehy Mail to sell CNG to Sheehy Mail at its EAF Oak Creek fueling station, which opened in December 2013, at agreed upon prices set forth in the agreement. The initial term expired in December 2018. The Company did not renew the contract since we acquired Sheehy Mail on January 2, 2019. Integrys Energy Services – Natural Gas, LLC agreed to supply natural gas to the station pursuant to a master retail gas sales agreement with EVO CNG dated November 1, 2013 and a related confirmation agreement dated January 27, 2015. The initial term of the agreement with Integrys Energy Services – Natural Gas, LLC expired in February 2019 and management is in negotiation to extend the terms of the agreement. The Company also has the option to secure an agreement with alternative suppliers at similar terms.
EAF Jurupa Valley. Our principal customer at the EAF Jurupa Valley station was Swift Transportation Co. (“Swift”). Swift owns the real estate underlying the EAF Jurupa Valley station and leases the property to EVO CNG pursuant to an oral month-to-month lease agreement. The founder of Swift is also a shareholder of the Company. Under the terms of the lease agreement, EVO CNG agreed to construct a CNG fueling station and to make provisions for the installation of a natural gas supply line to the property in order to meet Swift’s CNG fueling needs. EVO CNG entered into a line extension contract dated April 3, 2014 with Southern California Gas Company to serve as the supplier of CNG to the station. Southern California Gas Company agreed to install a pipeline connecting its existing infrastructure to the northwest border of the EAF Jurupa Valley property at no cost to EVO CNG or Swift, provided that at least 2.4 million DGE is pumped in any 12-month period during the first three years of operation. EVO CNG paid $290,000 for installation of a pipeline across the property to connect the fueling station to the new line laid by Southern California Gas Company. During December 2017, Swift ended their use of CNG trucks. Management believes it can replace the CNG volume for this location with the new trucking routes it is developing in that area. The station is in a highly industrialized area with significant trucking activity. The Company recently secured a freight route from Phoenix to Los Angeles. Business development efforts are underway to increase freight volume in this lane.
EAF San Antonio. EAF entered into an agreement with Central Freight Lines, Inc. (“Central Freight”) to sell CNG to Central Freight at the EAF San Antonio station at agreed upon prices set forth in the agreement. The agreement had an initial term of five years expiring September 2018. Management is in negotiation to extend the terms of the agreement. EAF entered into a natural gas service and pipeline agreement dated November 12, 2014, with LDC, LLC (“LDC”), pursuant to which LDC agreed to construct a pipeline and deliver natural gas to EAF at the station. EAF agreed that LDC will be its exclusive supplier of natural gas at the facility.
EAF Fort Worth. Central Freight is also our principal customer at the EAF Fort Worth Facility. The fuel purchase agreement for the EAF Fort Worth station has an initial four-year term that expired April 2019. EAF agreed to supply CNG to Central Freight at agreed upon prices set forth in the fuel purchase agreement. The Company is negotiating with Central Freight to extend the agreement.
EAF Lake Arlington. EAF Lake Arlington is a station that management believes is positioned to provide virtual pipeline opportunities. It is in a highly industrialized area and management believes that there is potential to use the station to transport natural gas to customers that may not be able to get natural gas at their facilities due to pipeline constraints.
Safety and Risk Management
 
The DOT requires that the Company perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations. Its safety program includes pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT. The Company also equips its company tractors with critical-event recorders to help continually train drivers, so that the Company can prevent or reduce the severity of accidents.
 
The primary safety-related risks associated with the Company’s business include damage to cargo hauled, physical damage to company equipment, damage to buildings and personal property, third party personal injury and property damage and workers’ compensation. The Company regularly reviews insurance limits and retentions. The Company believes that the insurance it currently maintains provides adequate coverage for its operations.
 
To the extent under dispatch and in furtherance of the Company’s business, its owner-operators are covered by the Company’s liability coverage. However, each owner-operator is responsible for physical damage to their own equipment, occupational accident coverage, liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes, and, in the case of fleet operators, any applicable workers’ compensation requirements for their employees.

Fuel
 
The Company actively manages its fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce its fuel costs. The Company purchases its fuel through a network of retail truck stops with which it has negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The Company seeks to reduce its fuel costs by routing its drivers to truck stops with which the Company has negotiated volume purchase discounts when fuel prices at such stops are lower than the bulk rate paid for fuel at the Company’s terminals. The Company stores fuel in aboveground and underground storage tanks at some of its facilities.
 
The Company believes the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel-efficient fleet by incorporating fuel efficiency measures and focusing on alternative fuel vehicles, particularly CNG vehicles that can leverage the Company’s current and future CNG fueling stations. The Company may periodically enter into various commodity hedging instruments to mitigate a portion of the effect of fuel price fluctuations. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded liabilities related to commodity hedging instruments in the amount of approximately $11,000 and $32,000, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
 
Thunder Ridge signed an agreement with a supplier on August 31, 2017 in which $1,000,000 was advanced and received by Thunder Ridge in 2017. The advance bears interest at 8.5% and is collateralized by substantially all of Thunder Ridge’s assets. As Thunder Ridge purchases fuel from the supplier’s station, Thunder Ridge reduces its fuel advance liability by $0.25 per gallon. Shortages of fuel, increases in fuel prices, or rationing of petroleum products could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations and profitability.
 
Seasonality
 
Due to seasonal increases in USPS volume, the Company’s truck utilization typically increases during the last quarter of each calendar year. At the same time, operating expenses increase, fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creates higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy the Company’s assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of customers, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results or make the Company’s results more volatile.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local government agencies. The Company and its drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT and the agencies within the states that regulate transportation, including those regulations relating to drug- and alcohol-testing and hours-of-service. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. The Company also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, environmental protection, drivers’ hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, ergonomics and other matters affecting safety, insurance and operating methods. Other agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the United States Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), also regulate the Company’s equipment, operations, drivers and the environment.
 
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service.
 
The FMCSA has adopted a data-driven Compliance, Safety and Accountability (the “CSA”) program as its safety enforcement and compliance model. The CSA program holds motor carries and drivers accountable for their role in safety by evaluating and ranking fleets and individual drivers on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program affects drivers because their safety performance and compliance impact their safety records and, while working for a carrier, will impact their carrier’s safety record. The methodology for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating relies upon implementation of Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASIC”) applicable to the on-road safety performance of the carrier’s drivers and certain of those rating results are provided on the FMCSA’s Carrier Safety Measurement System website. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for the Company, the Company’s fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to its peer firms, and the Company’s safety rating could be adversely impacted. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment (in the case of company drivers) or contracts (in the case of owner-operator drivers) with other carriers, or could cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with better fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and productivity. Additionally, the Company may incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve its scores as a result of poor rankings. Those carriers and drivers identified under the CSA program as exhibiting poor BASIC scores are prioritized for interventions, such as warning letters and roadside investigations, either of which may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. To promote improvement in all CSA categories, including those both over and under the established scoring threshold, the Company has procedures in place to address areas where it has exceeded the thresholds and the Company continually reviews all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness and revises them, as necessary, to establish positive improvement. However, the Company gives no assurance these measures will be effective.

The methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating is subject to possible change by the FMCSA and, as a result, the Company’s acceptable safety rating could be impaired. The Company currently has a “satisfactory” FMCSA rating on 100% of its fleet. If the FMCSA adopts rulemakings in the future that revise the methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating in a manner that incorporates more stringent standards, then the Company could be adversely affected. If the Company were to receive an unsatisfactory DOT safety rating as a result of any changes to the methodology, it could adversely affect the Company’s business.
 
The FMCSA has also mandated the use of Electronic Logging Devices (“ELDs”) for commercial motor vehicle drivers to measure their compliance with hours-of-service requirements.  Motor carriers and drivers may use automatic onboard recording device (“AOBRDs”) compliant with existing regulations in lieu of ELDs if the AOBRDs were put into use prior to December 18, 2017; however, all carriers and drivers subject to FMCSA rules must use ELDs starting December 16, 2019.
 
The Company is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from its vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, and adverse impacts to the environment, including to the soil, groundwater and surface water. The Company has implemented programs designed to monitor and address identified environmental risks.  Historically, the Company’s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results. If the Company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities. Those costs and liabilities may include the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of its operations in a particular area. The occurrence of any one or more of such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results.
 
The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, discharge of contaminants, environmental damage, and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others. If the Company is found to be responsible for such contamination or spills, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities, including costs for remediation, environmental natural resource damages and penalties.
 
The EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions have increasingly become more restrictive in recent years, and the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) have also developed stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks. New trailers are also now subject to greenhouse gas emission limits and fuel efficiency standards. The Company expects that these regulations will result in increased costs for acquiring new tractors and for additional parts and maintenance activities to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards. Such increased costs could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be adversely impacted.
 
In addition to federal emissions standards, a number of states have mandated, and may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment that could increase equipment or other costs for entire fleets. In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have also begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force the Company to alter its drivers’ behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or face a decrease in productivity.
 
Federal and state lawmakers also have implemented or proposed potential limits on greenhouse gas emissions under a variety of other climate-change initiatives. Compliance with such regulations may increase the cost of new tractors and trailers or require the Company to retrofit its equipment and could impair equipment productivity and increase its operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual value of these vehicles, could materially increase the Company’s operating expenses or otherwise adversely affect its operations.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 290 employees, consisting of 259 full-time employees and 31 part-time employees. The Company employed 269 drivers as of December 31, 2018. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
 
The Company also contracts with owner-operator drivers to provide and operate tractors, which provide additional revenue equipment capacity. Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance and highway use taxes. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 15 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 38% of the Company’s total miles for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
The Company’s strategy for both company and owner-operator drivers is to (i) hire safe and experienced drivers; (ii) promote retention with a competitive compensation package in the case of company drivers and contracted rates in the case of owner-operator drivers and positive working conditions; and (iii) minimize safety problems through careful screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, electronic logging system and rewards for accident-free driving.
