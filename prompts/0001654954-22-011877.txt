Item 1. Business
THE COMPANY

Aehr Test was incorporated in the state of California on May 25, 1977. We develop, manufacture and sell solutions that are designed to reduce the cost of testing and to perform reliability screening and stress testing, burn-in or cycling, of homogeneous and heterogenous logic and memory semiconductor integrated circuits, sensors, power and optical devices. These solutions can be used to simultaneously perform parallel testing and burn-in of packaged devices, singulated bare die or semiconductor devices while still in wafer form. The expanding automotive, mobility, networking, and telecommunications markets require semiconductor devices that meet increased quality and reliability specifications. To meet these needs, device manufacturers are increasing capacity and performing additional testing and burn-in of their products, creating opportunities for Aehr Test products in package and wafer-level testing. Leveraging its expertise as a long-time leading provider of burn-in equipment, and having installed over 2,500 systems worldwide, the Company has developed and introduced several innovative product families, including the ABTSTM and FOXTM family of systems, the WaferPakTM Contactor and the DiePak® Carrier for making electrical and thermal contact with devices under test, and WaferPak Aligners and DiePak Autoloaders for handling and alignment of devices into the corresponding WaferPaks and DiePaks. The ABTS family of packaged part burn-in and test systems can perform test during burn-in of complex devices, such as digital signal processors, microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory and systems-on-a-chip, and offers individual temperature control for high-power advanced logic devices while in a packaged form. The FOX family of systems are parallel test and burn-in systems designed to contact all devices on one or more wafers or panels of devices simultaneously, thus enabling cost effective full wafer parallel test and burn-in. The FOX systems are also used for parallel test and burn-in of singulated die or very small multi-IC modules. The WaferPak Contactor includes a full-wafer probe card for use in testing wafers in FOX systems. The DiePak Carrier is a reusable, temporary package that enables IC manufacturers to perform cost-effective test and burn-in of singulated bare die or very small multi-IC modules.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex, multi-step process, and defects or weaknesses that may result in the failure of a semiconductor device may be introduced at any process step. Failures may occur immediately or at any time during the operating life of the device, sometimes after several months of normal use. Semiconductor manufacturers rely on testing and reliability screening to identify and eliminate defects that occur during the manufacturing process.

Testing and reliability screening involve multiple steps. The first set of tests is typically performed by semiconductor device manufacturers before the processed semiconductor wafer is cut into individual die, in order to avoid the cost of packaging defective die into their packages. This “wafer probe” testing can be performed on one or many die at a time, including testing the entire wafer at once. Most leading-edge microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, memory ICs, sensors, power and optical devices (such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VCSELs) then undergo an extensive reliability screening and stress testing procedure known as burn-in or cycling, depending on the application. This can either be done at the wafer level, before the die are packaged, or at the package level, after the die are packaged. The burn-in process screens for early failures by operating the device at elevated voltages and temperatures, at up to 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher. Depending upon the application, the burn-in times can range anywhere from minutes to hours or even days. A typical burn-in system can process thousands of devices simultaneously. After burn-in, the devices undergo a final test process using automatic test equipment, or testers. For example, this cycling process screens silicon carbide semiconductor devices used in electric vehicle engine controller inverters and their corresponding on-board battery chargers for failure to meet current carrying, power loss and leakage specifications, as well as endurance requirements.

MARKETS

The Company’s semiconductor test and reliability qualification solutions address multiple test and burn-in segments including silicon carbide devices for electric vehicles, silicon photonics markets that include data center infrastructure and worldwide 5G infrastructure, 2D/3D sensor markets related to consumer electronics and automotive applications, and the data storage and memory markets.
Silicon Carbide

Silicon carbide power semiconductors have emerged as the preferred technology for battery electric vehicle power conversion in on-board and off-board electric vehicle battery chargers, and the electric power conversion and control of the electric engines. These devices reduce power loss by as much as greater than 75% over power silicon alternatives like IGBT (Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor) devices, which has essentially changed the entire market dynamic. With this development, the Company sees most, if not every automotive company that is working on electric vehicles, moving to silicon carbide-based powertrain and charging systems in the near future.

Aehr’s FOX-XP test and burn-in system allows for one of the key reliability screening tests to be completed on an entire wafer full of devices, testing all of them at one time, while also testing and monitoring every device for failures during the burn-in process to provide critical information on those devices. This is an enormously valuable capability, as it allows its customers to screen devices that would otherwise fail after they are packaged into multi-die modules where the yield impact is 10 times or even 100 times as costly. The Company’s FOX-P family of products are very cost-effective solutions for ensuring the critical quality and reliability of devices in this market, where performance and reliability can not only mean increased battery life, but also assurance against failure of a vehicle whose power semiconductor fails in the power train.

Silicon Photonics

The silicon photonics market is seeing increasing deployment of devices used in the expansion of bandwidth and infrastructure to meet the explosive growth of data center and 5G infrastructure.

The rapid growth of integrated optical devices in data centers and data center interconnect infrastructure, mobile devices, automotive applications, and wearable biosensor markets is driving substantially higher requirements for initial quality and long-term reliability, and they are increasing with every new product generation.

Silicon photonics devices are highly integrated silicon-based semiconductors that have embedded or integrated the non-silicon based laser transmitters and receivers to enable a smaller, lower cost, higher reliable alternative to traditional fiber optic transceivers currently used in data center and telecommunication infrastructure. These require a process step in manufacturing called stabilization where the devices are subjected to high temperatures and power to stabilize their output power. The Company’s solution makes it feasible to burn-in integrated silicon photonics devices while still in wafer form without adding the cost to the transceiver printed circuit board and other mechanical infrastructure of the final transceiver module, and that has both yield and significant cost savings. In the case of silicon photonics, the laser devices are bonded directly to a silicon-based device that has all the logic multiplexing and de-multiplexing, and other high-speed communication subsystems, all integrated into a silicon-based integrated circuit.

Mobile 2D and 3D Sensors

Sensors used in mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, wearables such as watches and fitness bands, and audio devices have become pervasive. Initially, sensors on smartphones allowed basic functions we have all come to expect such as touchscreens, rotational sensors, and fingerprint sensors, but have gotten more complex with added capabilities such as 3D facial recognition and time of flight distance measurements. We will see the addition of health monitoring sensors, 3D measurement capability, and other advanced sensors in the future. As sensors become more pervasive and add critical new functionality to devices, it becomes more and more important that the data collected be accurate and reliable, which we believe will drive more and more requirements for our solutions for production test and burn-in of these sensors.

Automotive Semiconductors

In addition, the rapid growth and increasing demand for reliability in automotive sensor technologies is a key market driver for the Company. These technologies include ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) capabilities such as collision avoidance systems using laser, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), and RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) or other sensing technologies. More and more new vehicles now include as standard capabilities collision avoidance systems that detect obstacles and monitor the vehicle’s surroundings to notify the driver of dangerous conditions and take evasive action. In addition to autonomous vehicles that require extremely high reliability of the devices in these systems, more and more vehicles around the world are embedding these systems and sensors into their everyday driving features. The Company sees the rising tide of the increasing number of embedded sensors and electrical and optical systems in vehicles as a key driver of the increasing market need for more and more reliable semiconductors. This, in turn, is increasing the need for 100% production test and burn-in of devices in order to lower the infant mortality rate and ensure that these devices and systems operate over the life of the vehicles.
Data Storage and Memory

The Company also sees the data storage and memory markets as critical new opportunities for its systems where these end markets and customers require devices to have extremely high levels of quality and long-term reliability.
PRODUCTS

The Company manufactures and markets full wafer contact test systems, test during burn-in systems, test fixtures and related accessories.

All of the Company’s systems are platform-based systems with a portfolio of current, voltage, digital and thermal capabilities, allowing them to be configured with optional features to meet customer requirements. Systems can be configured for use in production applications, where capacity, throughput and price are most important, or for reliability engineering and quality assurance applications, where performance and flexibility, such as extended temperature ranges, are essential.
FULL WAFER CONTACT SYSTEMS

The FOX-XP test and burn-in system, introduced in July 2016, is designed for devices in wafer, singulated die, and module form that require test and burn-in times typically measured in hours to days. The FOX-XP system can test and burn-in up to 18 wafers at a time. For high reliability applications, such as automotive, mobile devices, networking, telecommunications, sensors, power and solid-state devices, the FOX-XP system is a cost-effective solution for producing tested and burned-in die for use in multi-chip packages. Using Known-Good Die, or KGD, which are fully burned-in and tested die, in multi-chip/heterogeneous packages helps assure the reliability of the final product and lowers costs by increasing the yield of high-cost multi-chip packages. Wafer-level burn-in and test enables lower cost production of KGD for multi-chip modules, 3-D stacked packages and systems-in-a-package. The FOX-XP platform has been extended for burn-in and test of small multi-die modules by using DiePak Carriers. The DiePak Carrier with its multi-module sockets and high wattage dissipation capabilities has a capacity of hundreds of die or modules, much higher than the capacity of a traditional burn-in system with traditional single-device sockets and heat sinks. This capability was introduced in March 2017.

The FOX-NP was introduced in January 2019 and is a low-cost entry-level system to provide a configuration and price point for companies to do initial production qualification and new product introduction, enabling an easier transition to the FOX-XP system for high volume production test. The FOX-NP system is 100% compatible with the FOX-XP system and is configurable with up to two slot assemblies per system compared to up to 18 slot assemblies in the FOX-XP system.

The FOX-CP was introduced in February 2019 and is a low-cost single-wafer compact test and reliability verification solution for logic, memory, power and photonic devices. The FOX-CP reduces test cost by functionally testing wafers during reliability screening to identify failing logic, memory, power or photonic die before the die are integrated into their final package, and is optimal for test times ranging from minutes to a few hours or where multiple touchdowns are required to test the entire wafer. The FOX-CP includes an integrated prober which is equipped with optics for automatic pattern recognition so that the wafer is aligned properly for the testing process. It complements the capabilities of the FOX-XP and FOX-NP systems, which are optimal when the test time is measured in hours or days and the full wafer can be tested in a single touchdown.

The FOX-1P full wafer parallel test system, introduced in October 2014, is designed for massively parallel testing of devices at wafer level. The FOX-1P system is designed to make electrical contact to and test all of the die on a wafer in a single touchdown. The FOX-1P test head and WaferPak Contactor are compatible with industry-standard 300 mm wafer probers, which provide the wafer handling and alignment automation for the FOX-1P system. The FOX-1P pattern generator is designed to functionally test industry-standard memory devices such as flash and DRAMs, and it is optimized to test memory or logic ICs that incorporate design for testability, or DFT, and built-in self-test, or BIST. The FOX-1P universal per-pin architecture is designed to provide per-pin electronics and per-device power supplies and is tailored to full-wafer functional test. The Company believes that the FOX-1P system can significantly reduce the cost of testing IC wafers. The Company’s FOX-1P system was partially funded through a development agreement with a leading semiconductor manufacturer. The Company received the first production order of this new system and shipped the first system in July 2016.

One of the key components of the FOX systems is the patented WaferPak Contactor. The WaferPak Contactor contains a full-wafer single-touchdown probe card which is easily removable from the system. Traditional probe cards often are only able to contact a portion of the wafer, requiring multiple touchdowns to test the entire wafer. Traditional probe cards also require the use of a dedicated wafer prober handler for each wafer in order to press the wafer up to make contact with the probe card. The need for a wafer prober per wafer is a significant cost adder to the cost of testing a wafer, and also creates the need for significant clean room space to facilitate the footprint of a wafer prober per wafer. The unique design of the WaferPak as well as the FOX-XP and FOX-NP systems remove the need for a dedicated wafer prober per wafer. A single FOX-XP system with a set of WaferPak Contactors can test up to 18 wafers at a time in the same footprint as a single-wafer wafer prober and test system offered by Aehr’s competitors. The WaferPak Contactor is intended to accommodate a wide range of contactor technologies so that the contactor technology can evolve along with the changing requirements of the customer’s wafers. The WaferPak Contactors are custom designed for each device type, each of which has a typical lifetime of two to seven years, depending on the device life cycle. Therefore, multiple sets of WaferPak Contactors could be purchased over the life of a FOX system.

Another key component of the FOX-XP and FOX-NP systems is the patented DiePak Carrier. The DiePak Carrier, which is easily removable from the system, contains many multi-module or die sockets with very fine-pitch probes. Traditional sockets contact only a single device, requiring multiple large numbers of sockets and burn-in boards to test a production lot of devices. The unique design accommodates a wide range of socket sizes and densities so that the DiePak Carrier technology can evolve along with the changing requirements of the customer’s devices. The DiePak Carriers are custom designed for each device type, each of which has a typical lifetime of two to seven years, depending on the device life cycle. Therefore, multiple sets of DiePak Carriers could be purchased over the life of a FOX-XP or FOX-NP system.

Another key component of our FOX-XP and FOX-NP and test solution is the WaferPak Aligner. The WaferPak Aligner performs alignment of the customer’s wafer to the WaferPak Contactor so that the wafer can be tested and burned-in by the FOX-XP and FOX-NP systems. The Company offers an automated aligner for high volume production applications, which can support several FOX-XP or FOX-NP systems, and a manual aligner for low volume production or engineering applications.

Similar to the WaferPak Aligner for WaferPak Contactors, the Company offers the DiePak Loader for DiePak Carriers. The DiePak Loader performs automatic loading of the customer’s modules to the DiePak Carrier so that the modules can be tested and burned-in by the FOX-XP and FOX-NP system. Typically, one DiePak Loader can support several FOX-XP or FOX-NP systems.

Net sales of full wafer contact product lines, systems, WaferPak Contactors, DiePaks Carriers and services for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $48.9 million, $15.0 million, and $19.8 million, respectively, and accounted for approximately 96%, 90% and 89% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

SYSTEMS FOR PACKAGED PARTS

Test during burn-in, or TDBI, systems consist of several subsystems: pattern generation and test electronics, control software, network interface and environmental chamber. The test pattern generator allows duplication of most of the functional tests performed by a traditional tester. Pin electronics at each burn-in board, or BIB, position are designed to provide accurate signals to the ICs being tested and detect whether a device is failing the test.

Devices being tested are placed on BIBs and loaded into environmental chambers which typically operate at temperatures from 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) up to 150 degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit). Using our optional chambers, our systems can produce temperatures as low as -55 degrees Celsius (-67 degrees Fahrenheit). A single BIB can hold up to several hundred ICs, and a production chamber holds up to 72 BIBs, resulting in thousands of memory or logic devices being tested in a single system.

The Advanced Burn-in and Test System, or ABTS, was introduced in fiscal 2008. Several updates to the ABTS system have been made since its introduction, including the ABTS-P system released in 2012. The ABTS family of products is based on a hardware and software architecture that is intended to address not only today’s devices, but also future devices for many years to come. The ABTS system can test and burn-in both high-power logic and low-power ICs. It can be configured to provide individual device temperature control for devices up to 70W or more and with up to 320 I/O channels. The ABTS system is nearing the end of its lifecycle and limited shipments are expected in the future.

Net sales of packaged part product lines, systems and services for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $1.9 million, $1.6 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, and accounted for approximately 4%, 10% and 11% of the Company’s net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

CUSTOMERS

The Company markets and sells its products throughout the world to semiconductor manufacturers, semiconductor contract assemblers, electronics manufacturers and burn-in and test service companies.

Sales to the Company’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 98%, 84%, and 87% of its net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2022, one customer accounted for approximately 82% of the Company’s net sales. During fiscal 2021, four customers accounted for approximately 24%, 23%, 20% and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales. During fiscal 2020, three customers accounted for approximately 43%, 16% and 15%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales for any of these periods. The Company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future. In addition, sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Such fluctuations may result in changes in utilization of the Company’s facilities and resources. The loss of or reduction or delay in orders from a significant customer or a delay in collecting or failure to collect accounts receivable from a significant customer could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.
MARKETING, SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT

The Company has sales and service operations in the United States, Philippines and Taiwan, dedicated service resources in Germany, China, Japan and South Korea, and has established a network of distributors and sales representatives in certain key parts of the world. In fiscal 2020, the Company moved to a sales representative distributorship model for sales in Japan and Germany, closing its subsidiary in Japan, see Note 17, “Restructuring,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and eliminating the direct sales staff at its Germany subsidiary. See “REVENUE RECOGNITION” in Item 7 under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a further discussion of the Company’s relationship with distributors, and its effects on revenue recognition.

The Company’s customer service and support program includes system installation, system repair, applications engineering support, spare parts inventories, customer training and documentation. The Company has applications engineering and field service personnel located near and sometimes co-located at our customers and includes resources at the corporate headquarters in Fremont, California, at customer locations in Texas, at the Company’s subsidiaries in Germany and Philippines, at its branch office in Taiwan, and also through 3rd party agreements in China and South Korea. The Company’s distributors provide applications and field service support in other parts of the world. The Company customarily provides a warranty on its products. The Company offers service contracts on its systems directly and through its subsidiaries, distributors and representatives. The Company believes that maintaining a close relationship with customers and providing them with ongoing engineering support improves customer satisfaction and will provide the Company with a competitive advantage in selling its products to the Company’s customers.

BACKLOG

At May 31, 2022, the Company’s backlog was $11.1 million compared with $1.6 million at May 31, 2021. The Company’s backlog consists of product orders for which confirmed purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled for shipment within 12 months. Due to the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellations and potential delays in product shipments or development projects, the Company’s backlog as of a particular date may not be indicative of net sales for any succeeding period.
RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The Company historically has devoted a significant portion of its financial resources to research and development programs and expects to continue to allocate significant resources to these efforts. Certain research and development expenditures related to non-recurring engineering milestones have been transferred to cost of goods sold, reducing research and development expenses. The Company’s research and development expenses during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $5.8 million, $3.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively.

7


The Company conducts ongoing research and development to design new products and to support and enhance existing product lines. Building upon the expertise gained in the development of its existing products, the Company has developed the FOX family of systems for performing test and burn-in of entire processed wafers, and burn-in of devices in singulated die and module form, including the FOX-NP and FOX-CP systems released during fiscal 2019. The Company is developing enhancements to our packaged parts and wafer level burn-in products, intended to improve the capability and performance for testing and burn-in of future generation devices and provide the flexibility in a wide variety of applications.

MANUFACTURING

The Company assembles its products from components and parts manufactured by others, including environmental chambers, power supplies, metal fabrications, printed circuit assemblies, ICs, burn-in sockets, high-density interconnects, wafer contactors and interconnect substrates. The Company’s strategy is to use in-house manufacturing only when necessary to protect a proprietary process or when a significant improvement in quality, cost or lead time can be achieved and relies on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies used in its products. Final assembly and testing are performed at the Company’s principal manufacturing facility located in Fremont, California.
COMPETITION

The semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive. Significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price, technical capabilities, quality, flexibility, automation, cost of ownership, reliability, throughput, product availability and customer service. In each of the markets it serves, the Company faces competition from established competitors and potential new entrants, many of which have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than the Company.

The Company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics. New product introductions by the Company’s competitors or by new market entrants could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the Company’s products. The Company has observed price competition in the systems market, particularly with respect to its less advanced products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price-based competition, resulting in lower prices which could adversely affect the Company’s operating margins and results. The Company believes that to remain competitive it must invest significant financial resources in new product development and expand its customer service and support worldwide. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

The Company relies primarily on the technical and creative ability of its personnel, its proprietary software, and trade secrets and copyright protection, rather than on patents, to maintain its competitive position. The Company’s proprietary software is copyrighted and licensed to the Company’s customers. At May 31, 2022, the Company held 56 issued United States patents with expiration date ranges from 2022 to 2038 and had several additional United States patent applications and foreign patent applications pending.

The Company’s ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology and information. Although the Company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that these measures will be adequate or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently. Further, there can be no assurance that claims allowed on any patent issued to the Company will be sufficiently broad to protect the Company’s technology, that any patent will be issued to the Company from any pending application or that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the Company’s intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or determine the validity and scope of the Company’s proprietary rights, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s intellectual property rights, if challenged, will be upheld as valid. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results, regardless of the outcome of the litigation. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the patents issued to the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the Company. Also, there can be no assurance that the Company will have the financial resources to defend its patents from infringement or claims of invalidity.


8


There are currently no pending claims against the Company regarding infringement of any patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, the Company may, from time to time, receive communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against the Company. Such claims could include assertions that the Company’s products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of third parties, requests for indemnification against such infringement or suggest the Company may be interested in acquiring a license from such third parties. There can be no assurance that any such claim made in the future will not result in litigation, which could involve significant expense to the Company, and, if the Company is required or deems it appropriate to obtain a license relating to one or more products or technologies, there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 

As of May 31, 2022, the Company, including its foreign subsidiaries and one branch office, employed 91 persons collectively, on a regular full-time basis, of whom 21 were engaged in research, development and related engineering, 26 were engaged in manufacturing, 35 were engaged in marketing, sales and customer support and 9 were engaged in general administration and finance functions. In addition, the Company from time to time employs a number of contractors, temporary, and part-time employees, particularly to perform customer support and manufacturing.

The Company’s employees are dispersed across principal offices in the United States, Germany, Taiwan, and Philippines. In addition, our service and support organization has employees located worldwide, at or near customer facilities, to provide timely customer response. As of May 31, 2022 regular full-time employees were located in the following geographic areas: 71 United States, 1 Japan, 4 Taiwan, and 15 in the Philippines.

The Company’s success is in part dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled workers, who are in high demand. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union and the Company has never experienced a work stoppage. The Company’s management considers its relations with its employees to be good. The Company regularly evaluates its ability to attract and retain its employees. The Company has had relatively low turnover rates within its workforce, with 52% of its United States regular full-time workforce being with the Company for 5 years or more.

The Company believes that the investments we make in driving a strong, values-based culture and supporting its employees through programs, development, and competitive pay enhances its organizational capability. Company management quarterly reviews retention and turnover, employee communications, performance review status, and compensation and benefits to identify potential issues or opportunities. The Company periodically performs employee surveys to monitor employee satisfaction and the Company follows-up with an action planning process to actively respond to employee feedback.

The Company has been impacted by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, which has spread throughout the world. Our business’ top priority during the COVID-19 pandemic is protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, customers and community. We introduced policies and procedures to increase workplace flexibility such as working remotely where possible to reduce the number of people who are on campus each day. As a global supplier of Critical Infrastructure Sectors, as defined by the cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, we have supported and continue to support customers during the pandemic. In the interest of public health, all onsite operations generally use the minimum number of people to safely execute tasks and follow enhanced safety and health protocols including screenings, social distancing, and use of personal protective equipment.
