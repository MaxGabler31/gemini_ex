ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND 
 
We were incorporated as Pharmascan Corp. in the State of Nevada on March 31, 2009. On September 21, 2010, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to Technologies Scan Corp. On April 1, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to “PetVivo Holdings, Inc.” (the “Name Change”).
 
Minnesota PetVivo
 
On March 11, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the execution of that certain securities exchange agreement dated March 11, 2014 (the “Securities Exchange Agreement”) with PetVivo Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“PetVivo”), and the shareholders of PetVivo who hold of record the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of PetVivo (the “PetVivo Shareholders”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Securities Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of PetVivo from the PetVivo Shareholders, thus making PetVivo our wholly-owned subsidiary, in exchange for the issuance to the PetVivo Shareholders of an aggregate 2,310,939,804 shares of our restricted common stock.
 
PetVivo was founded in 2013 by John Lai and John Dolan, and is based in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. PetVivo is a biomedical device company engaged in the business of acquiring/in-licensing and adapting human biomedical technology and products for commercial sale in the veterinary market to treat pets and other animals suffering from arthritis and other afflictions. PetVivo’s initial product, which is now being commercialized, is a medical device featuring the injections of patented gel-like protein-based biomaterials into the afflicted body parts of pets and other animals suffering from osteoarthritis. PetVivo obtained the exclusive rights in a License Agreement for commercialization of this product from Gel-Del for the treatment of pets and other animals.
 
Gel-Del Technologies Inc. 
 
Gel-Del is a biomaterial and medical device development and manufacturing company with its offices and production facilities based in Edina, Minnesota, and was founded in 1999 by its chief executive officer, Dr. David B. Masters. Dr. Masters developed Gel-Del’s proprietary biomaterials that simulate a body’s cellular tissue and thus can be readily and effectively utilized to manufacture implantable therapeutic medical devices. The chief advantage of Gel-Del biomaterials is their enhanced biocompatibility with living tissues throughout the body. We are commercializing their technology in the veterinary field for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Gel-Del has also successfully completed a pivotal clinical trial using their novel thermoplastic biomaterial as dermal filler for human cosmetic applications. Gel-Del’s core competencies are developing and manufacturing medical devices containing its proprietary thermoplastic protein-based biomaterials that mimic the body’s tissue to allow integration, tissue repair, and regeneration for long-term implantation. These biomaterials are produced using a patented and scalable self-assembly production process. The inherent thermoplastic properties of these biomaterials are then utilized to manufacture or coat implantable devices.
 
While working together relating to their licensing agreement, in early 2014 our management and the management of Gel-Del determined to combine the two companies into one business entity producing, marketing and selling medical products based on Gel-Del technology for both humans and animals.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 
 
On March 20, 2017, we entered into triangular merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, PetVivo Holdings Newco Inc. (“Newco”) and Gel-Del (the “Merger Agreement”). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, we effected a statutory merger transaction resulting in an exchange by the shareholders of Gel-Del on a pro rata basis of 100% of all outstanding Gel-Del capital stock in exchange for 5,450,000 shares of our restricted common stock, which represented approximately 30% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock post-merger.
 
On April 10, 2017, the Merger Agreement was consummated and we completed the acquisition of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Gel-Del from the Gel-Del shareholders. The acquisition was completed and consummated through a statutory merger between Gel-Del and NewCo, which resulted in Gel-Del being the surviving entity and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. The Merger Agreement became effective upon the filing with the Secretary of State of Minnesota on April 10, 2017. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger Agreement, each share of Gel-Del common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger Agreement was converted into the right to receive 0.798 common share of the Company. Gel-Del did not have any outstanding options, warrants or other derivative securities or rights convertible into securities.
 
In accordance with this merger transaction, we acquired all Gel-Del technology and related patents and other intellectual property (IP) and production techniques, as well as Gel-Del’s modern and secure biomedical product manufacturing facilities being constructed in Edina, Minnesota.
 
Company Overview
 
We are based in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota. We are a biomedical device company, which has been primarily engaged in the business of adapting human biomedical technology for products to be introduced for commercial sale in the veterinary market to treat pets and other animals suffering from arthritis and other afflictions. Our initial product, now being commercialized, is a medical device featuring injections of patented gel-like biomaterials into the afflicted body parts of pets or other animals suffering from osteoarthritis. The technology and manufacturing capability of this product was developed by Gel-Del and acquired by us for use to treat dogs, horses and other animals, but not for treatment of human afflictions. While working together pursuant to our initial license agreement, we and Gel-Del determined to combine our two companies through a stock exchange merger for the purpose of creating one combined entity utilizing Gel-Del technology to produce, market, and sell medical products based on Gel-Del technology for both animals and humans. After lengthy negotiations the parties entered into a definitive agreement for this merger, which resulted in the consummation of the merger in April, 2017.

CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS
 
General
 

We are an emerging biomedical device company focused on the licensing and commercialization of innovative medical devices and therapeutics for pets, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We operate in the $15 billion US veterinary care market that has grown at a CAGR of 6.4% over the past five years according to the American Pet Products Association. Despite the market size, veterinary clinics and hospitals have very few treatments and/or drugs for use in pets and other animals. The role of pets in the family has greatly evolved in recent years. Many pet owners consider their pets an important member of the family. They are now willing to spend greater amounts of money on their pets to maintain their health and quality of life. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to leverage investments already expended in the development of human therapeutics to commercialize treatments for pets in a capital and time efficient way. A key component of this strategy is the accelerated timeline to revenues for veterinary medical devices, which enter the market earlier than the more stringently regulated veterinary pharmaceuticals or human therapeutics.
 
We are planning to aggressively launch our lead product Kush™ Canine in Q4 2017. Kush Canine is a veterinarian-administered joint injection for the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. The Kush Canine device is made from natural components that are lubricious and cushioning to perform like cartilage for the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.
 

We believe that Kush Canine is a superior treatment that safely improves joint function. The reparative Kush Canine particles are lubricious, cushioning and long lasting. The spongy protein-based particles in Kush Canine mimic the composition and protective function of cartilage (i.e., providing both a slippery cushion and healing scaffolding). The Kush Canine particles protect the joint as an artificial cartilage. Using industry sources we estimate osteoarthritis afflicts 20 million owned dogs in the United States and the European Union, making canine osteoarthritis a $2.3 billion market opportunity. See Johnston, Spencer A. “Osteoarthritis. Joint anatomy, physiology, and pathobiology.” The Veterinary clinics of North (1997):699-723; http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/petoverpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html; and http://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Osteoarthritis is a condition with degenerating cartilage, creating joint stiffness from mechanical stress resulting in inflammation and pain. The lameness caused by osteoarthritis worsens with time from the ongoing loss of protective cushion and lubricity (i.e., loss of slippery padding). There is no current treatment for osteoarthritis, only palliative pain therapy or joint replacement. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to alleviate the pain and inflammation, but long-term use has been shown to cause gastric problems. NSAIDs do not treat the cartilage degeneration issue to halt or slow the progression of the osteoarthritis condition. 

 
We believe that our Kush Canine osteoarthritis treatment is far superior to current methodology of using NSAIDs. NSAIDs have many side effects, especially in canines, whereas the company’s injected Kush Canine treatment has been found to elicit no adverse side effects. Remarkably, Kush treated dogs show an increase in activity even after they no longer are receiving pain medication.

No special training is required for the administration of the Kush Canine devices. The treatment is injected into synovial joint space using standard intra-articular injection technique and multiple joints can be treated simultaneously. Kush Canine immediately treats effects of osteoarthritis with no special post treatment requirements.
 
Historically, drug sales represent up to 30% of revenues at a typical veterinary practice (Veterinary Practice News). Revenues and margins at veterinary practices are being eroded because online, big box and traditional pharmacies recently started filling veterinary prescriptions. Veterinary practices are looking for ways to replace the lost prescription revenues. Our treatments expand practice revenues & margins because they are veterinarian-administered. Our Kush Canine device is veterinarian-administered to expand practice revenues and margins. We believe that the increased revenues and margins provided by Kush Canine will accelerate its adoption rate and propel it forward as the standard of care for canine osteoarthritis.
 
Our product launch schedule includes at least two additional product releases in 2018. Our Kush Equine device for the treatment of equine lameness related to or impacting synovial joints is scheduled for launch in Q1 2018. The Kush Equine product has similar features and benefits as our Kush Canine device. In addition to being a treatment for osteoarthritis, the joint cushioning and lubricity effects of our devices have shown an ability to treat equine lameness that is due to navicular disease (a problem associated with misalignment of joints and bones in the hoof and digits). We anticipate launching our Kush Digital Cushion (DC) device for the treatment of navicular disease in 2018.
 
Based on a variety of industry sources we estimate that 1 million owned horses in the United Stated and European Union suffer from lameness and/or navicular disease each year, making the equine lameness and navicular disease market an annual opportunity worth $600 million. See Kane, Albert J., Josie Traub-Dargatz, Willard C. Losinger, and Lindsey P. Garber; “The occurrence and causes of lameness and laminitis in the US horse population” Proc Am Assoc Equine Pract. San Antonio (2000): 277-80; Seitzinger, Ann Hillberg, J. L. Traub-Dargatz, A. J. Kane, C. A. Kopral, P. S. Morley, L. P. Garber, W. C. Losinger, and G. W. Hill. “A comparison of the economic costs of equine lameness, colic, and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM).” In Proceedings, pp. 1048-1050. 2000; and Kilby, E. R. 10 CHAPTER, The Demographics of the U.S. Equine Population, The State of the Animals IV: 2007.
 
Our current pipeline includes 17 therapeutic devices for both veterinary and human clinical applications.

We anticipate growing our product pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of additional proprietary products from human medical device companies specifically for use in pets. In addition to commercializing our own products in strategic market sectors and in view of the Company’s vast proprietary product pipeline, the Company anticipates establishing strategic out-licensing partnerships to provide secondary revenues.
 
We plan to commercialize our products in the United States through distribution relationships supported by regional and national distributors and complemented by the use of social media educating and informing the pet owners, and in Europe and rest of world through commercial partners.
 
Most veterinarians in the United States buy a majority of their equipment and supplies from one of six veterinary products distributors. Combined, these six distributors delivery more than 85%, by revenue, of the products sold to companion animal veterinarians in the U.S. Our product distribution will leverage the existing supply chain and veterinary clinic and clinician relationships already established by these large distributors. We plan to support this distribution channel with regional sales representatives. Our representatives will support our distributors and the veterinary clinics and hospitals. We will also target pet owners with product education and treatment awareness campaigns utilizing a variety of social media tools. The unique nature and the anticipated benefits provided by our products are expected to generate significant consumer response.
 
Gel-Del Particles have been through a human trial and have been classified as a medical device. The FDA does not require submission of a 510(k) or formal pre-market approval for medical devices used in veterinary medicine. We anticipate initial commercial production and sales in early 2018. We anticipate selling through existing veterinary distributors. See — “Gel-Del Technology” below.
 
Gel-Del Technology
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into that certain exclusive license agreement and manufacturing and supply agreement dated August 2, 2013 (the “License Agreement”) with Gel-Del pertaining to the manufacture and supply of products by Gel-Del derived from certain technology, including protein-based biomaterials and devices, which are beneficial for the veterinary treatment of animals having orthopedic joint afflictions (the “Technology”). We have since terminated the License Agreement based upon consummation of the Stock Exchange Agreement, which was terminated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger transaction with Gel-Del.
 
Gel-Del is a biomaterial and medical device manufacturing company based in Edina, Minnesota. We will be working together to commercialize Gel-Del’s technology in the veterinary field for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Gel-Del has also successfully completed a pivotal clinical trial using their novel thermoplastic biomaterial as dermal filler for human cosmetic applications. Gel-Del’s core competencies are developing and manufacturing medical devices containing its proprietary thermoplastic protein-based biomaterials that mimic the body’s tissue to allow integration, tissue repair, and regeneration for long-term implantation. These biomaterials are produced using a patented and scalable self-assembly production process. The inherent thermoplastic properties of these biomaterials are then utilized to manufacture or coat implantable devices.
 
Below is a listing of Gel-Del technologies:
 
Dermal Filler 
 

Gel-Del® biomaterials are constructed from purified water, protein, and carbohydrate, tailored to simulate different body tissues that biologically integrate (bio-integration). Gel-Del’s technology is used to manufacture CosmetaLife®, dermal filler for wrinkle treatment by injection. These formed gel-particles fill, integrate and rejuvenate dermal skin tissue to remove the wrinkle.

Cardiovascular Devices 
 

The blood compatible Gel-Del material, which allows blood contact and bio-integrative processes to occur without clotting, platelet attachment, or thrombogenesis, is used to repair cardiovascular tissue. VasoGraft™, a blood vessel graft made from Gel-Del VasoCover™ material, is designed to mimic natural blood vessel tissue in almost every respect, including the components used. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drug Delivery 
 

Unique fabrication techniques allow Gel-Del’s material to homogeneously distribute drug in milligram to nanogram amounts, resulting in optimum performance and manufacturing capabilities for a variety of delivery methods, such as coatings, injectables, implantables or transmucosal delivery. The first planned transmucosal product, OraPatch™, has been optimized and tested with peptide drugs with better efficacy than oral dosing via swallowing. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Orthopedic Devices 
 

Gel-Del material will be used in a variety of shapes for orthopedic and dental applications. The first products, OrthoGelic™ and OrthoMetic™, will be aimed at difficult to heal, non-union broken bones, by using particles to fill the empty space. The orthopedic biomaterial, made to mimic the structural components of bone, can allow integration and healing to fill in the break and exclude non-bone tissue infiltration. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To maximize the strength and value of our patent portfolio many of the claims use the transitional term “comprising”, which is synonymous with “including,” This use of transitional language is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. Our patents also include method claims covering many of the applications and uses of the biomaterials as medical devices and drug delivery systems. With eight issued or allowed United States Patents that contain 328 claims, our intellectual property portfolio strongly protects our proprietary technology, including the composition of raw elements used to produce our formulations, the fabricated biomaterials and their application in end products, thereby making our material and devices much more attractive to industry partners.
 
We will seek to protect our products and technologies through a combination of patents, regulatory exclusivity, and proprietary know-how. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current compounds and any future compounds in development. We also strenuously protect our proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements, trade secrets and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.
 
We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, including those of our company, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment of ownership to us the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
Companion Animal Market 
 

Over the last several decades, we believe the animal health market and industry has a strong component in the overall U.S. economy and is more resistant to economic cycles. The veterinary sector is as an attractive area to participate in the growth of the broader healthcare industry without reimbursement risk. Based on our best knowledge, U.S. consumers will spend an estimated $60 billion on pets this year—a number that has been growing at a pace of more than 5% over the past decade. Therapeutics constitutes a small portion of this market (less than $2 billion) but we believe it is poised to expand as pet care becomes more complex and companies launch new products for unmet needs. The growth in the U.S. companion animal market has been continuing to increase due to the increase in the number of pet owning households. The American Pet Products Association (APPA) 2013-2014 National Pet Owners Survey indicates U.S. pet ownership reached record levels in 2013. Specifically, 68% of all U.S. households owned a pet in 2013, up from 62% in 2002. The number of pet owning households totaled 82.5 million, representing a 10-year CAGR of 2.5%. In 2012, dogs and cats were the most popular pet species, owned by 46.7% and 37.3% of U.S. households, respectively. APPA also reported that there were 83.3 million dogs (10-year CAGR of +2.5%) and 95.6 million cats (10-year CAGR of +2.1%) in the U.S. In comparison, the total U.S. human population increased at +0.9% CAGR over the last decade. APPA reported that 2.8% of U.S. households owned horses in 2012. According to the APPA the total number of horses owned by U.S. households increased to 8.3 million in 2012, a 5% increase over the previous APPA survey conducted two years earlier.

Osteoarthritis Market. Osteoarthritis, the most common inflammatory joint disease in both dogs and horses, is a progressive condition that is caused by a deterioration of joint cartilage. Over time the joint cartilage deterioration creates joint stiffness from mechanical stress resulting in inflammation, pain and loss of range of motion, which may be referred to as lameness. Osteoarthritis joint stiffness and lameness worsens with time from gradual cartilage degeneration and an ongoing loss of protective cushion and lubricity (i.e., loss of slippery padding). As there is no cure for osteoarthritis, the various treatment methods are focused on managing the related symptoms of pain and inflammation. Veterinarians recommend several treatments depending on the severity of the disease, including a combination of rest, weight loss, physical rehabilitation, and a regimen of pain and anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to alleviate the pain and inflammation caused by OA, but long-term NSAIDs cause gastric problems. Moreover, NSAIDs do not treat the cartilage degeneration issue to halt or slow progression of the OA condition. 
 
The prevalence of companion animal osteoarthritis is estimated through a variety of methods. In looking at the dog osteoarthritis incidence Spence Johnston’s article “Osteoarthritis. Joint anatomy, physiology, and pathobiology” is often cited, this article reports that 20% of all dogs over the age of one year suffer from osteoarthritis. Using this simple methodology, management has estimated that 20% of the total dog population is under age one.
 
83.3 million – 20% = 66.6 million x 20% with OA = 13.3 million dogs with OA in U.S.
 
Our osteoarthritis market data has been validated by a number of reports evaluating a new NSAID that is estimated to be ready for commercial sale by Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (PETX) in 2016. Craig-Hallum’s July 22, 2013 institutional research report on Aratana Therapeutics estimates the U.S. dog osteoarthritis market at 16.6 million dogs. William Blair & Company, L.L.C. released a July 25, 2013 Equity Research report by Aratana Therapeutics that concluded that roughly 10% of dogs and cat suffer from osteoarthritis. (83.3 million dogs x 10% = 8.3 million dogs with OA) Stifel issued report on Aratana Therapeutics dated July 22, 2013 that estimated the osteoarthritis market to be 55% of dogs over the age of 10. This equates to a US market in 2014 of 7.1 million dogs with osteoarthritis.
 
Horse Osteoarthritis (Lameness)
 
The equine osteoarthritis is the most common cause of lameness in horses. The annual average costs for diagnosis and treatment of equine lameness $3,000 per horse, with downtime & homecare costs being much higher (Oke and McIlwraith, 2010). “The USDA National Economic Cost of Equine Lameness… in the United States” published by 1978 places the annual incidence of lameness at 8.5-13.7 lameness events/100 horses.
 
As noted previously the APPA reported the total number of horses owned by U.S. households increased to 8.3 million in 2012. A 2007 publication by Emily Kilby “The Demographics of the U.S. Equine Population” concludes the horse population for 9,464,200 in 2006 with racehorses being 9% of that population or 846,000 horses. The article “The Occurrence and Causes of Lameness and Laminitis in the U.S. Horse Population” estimates that 17% of racehorses and 5.4% of the rest of the horse population go lame annually. Based on the above assumptions we calculate that there are up to 611,658 new lame horses each year.
 
Distribution
 
Most U.S. veterinarians buy a majority of their equipment and supplies from a preferred distributor. More than 75% of veterinarians name Butler Schein Animal Health, Inc., Webster Veterinary Supply Inc. (recently acquired by Patterson), MWI, Midwest Veterinary Supply, Inc. or Victor Medical Company as their preferred distributor. Combined, these top tier distributors sell more than 85%, by revenue, of the products sold to companion animal veterinarians in the U.S. Butler, Webster and MWI are recognized by manufacturers, distributors and veterinarians as the pre-eminent national companion animal veterinary supply distributors in the US. There are no other distributors that provide equivalent levels of service to manufacturers and regularly visit veterinarians in as wide a geographic area as Butler, Webster or MWI. Midwest and Victor are large, regional distributors, also with strong reputations for high-quality service. The above data in this paragraph was sourced from File No. 101 0023 at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

Our product distribution will leverage the existing supply chain and veterinary clinic and clinician relationships already established by these large distributors. We intend to support and supplement this distribution channel with regional business development & training representatives. Our business development representatives will provide product training to distribution representatives, veterinarians and other veterinary staff. In addition our representatives will exhibit at key veterinary conferences in addition to supporting ongoing case studies. All of these sales, distribution, marketing and education efforts will also be supported by both veterinarian and pet owner product education and treatment awareness campaigns that will be conducted utilizing a variety of social media tools. The unique nature and the anticipated benefits provided by our first product are expected to generate significant consumer response.
 
Our primary distribution channel is through the existing stocking distributors who having operating typical margins between fourteen to sixteen percent. We have budgeted a twenty percent margin for our distributors and a full fifty percent margin for the veterinary practices.
 
Gel-Del Particle Devices
 
Orthopedic Joint Treatments
 

A treatment for joint pain, which is made of injected protein-based gel-particles. In vivo studies indicate that the gel particle device can easily be combined with synovial fluid in a rabbit knee to form a joint cushion, buffering the adjacent bones/cartilage where no damage was caused to the cartilage from replacing the synovial fluid. The particles show an effectiveness to repair, reconstitute or remodel the tissue, cartilage, ligaments and/or bone and/or enhance the functionality of the joint (e.g. repair deteriorated components present in the joint to provide cushion or shock absorbing features to the joint and to provide joint lubricity) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AppTec Laboratories accomplished a gel-particle rabbit study. In short, New Zealand white rabbits (6) were injected in both stifle joints (knees) to fill but not extend the synovial space (~0.5 cc GDP/site).Rabbits were tested every other day for abnormal clinical signs including range of motion and joint observations until sacrifice. Behavioral testing revealed no abnormal scores for range of motion, withdrawal response, or joint observations (all animals were 100% normal). At one week and at four weeks the animals were sacrificed. AppTec pathologists evaluated knee joint histology. The reported cartilage surfaces of the femoral and tibia condyles and the menisci were grossly and histologically 100% normal for all animals and test sites. The test particles were found in all of the injection sites. 
The test article did not cause changes in the articular cartilage of the femur or tibia when injected into the stifle joint of rabbits. The test article and control rabbit knees were not different for either 1 or 4 week time points for all histological measurements. In conclusion, the particles do not cause inflammation or damage to knee joint and will stick to exposed tissues and biologically integrate with those tissues. The particles were not found to stick to articular cartilage in any sample.

Regenerative Characteristics
 
The particles devices for joint injections have been extensively studied for a broad range of applications including the treatment of wrinkles as dermal filler. Here is an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies completed on CosmetaLife, which is the name used for particle device when they used as a dermal filler.

Particle Integration after 12 Weeks The image at left shows collagen in blue, fibroblasts in red and CosmetaLife in gray. Note the typical cellularization and integration of collagen within the CosmetaLife matrix perimeter. Also notice the fibroblasts (collagen producers) are integrated throughout the injection site. Microvascularization, indicated by arrowheads, is also present in several locations. There is little to no sign of inflammation. Trichrome Stain - 20x Objective CosmetaLife (GDP) Particles 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CosmetaLife is an easy-to-inject, water-protein-based dermal filler that not only fills nasolabial wrinkle depressions but also helps rejuvenate the dermal tissues, counteracting damage that causes wrinkles. The dermal cells are attracted to the CosmetaLife gel-particles, attach to them, and then slowly replace them with natural dermal material (extracellular matrix). The natural biological replacement process of CosmetaLife to collagen is estimated to take 6-12 months. CosmetaLife clinical trial on nasolabial folds supports this estimate. According to current scientific thought, the resulting natural extracellular matrix, comprised mostly of collagen, is estimated to last 10-16 years.
 
CosmetaLife injections allow the body to create more natural dermal structure in and around every particle. Enhancing the natural process of dermal tissue construction with CosmetaLife allows for long-term dermal contouring, corrections, and rejuvenation with little to no adverse side effects noted in clinical trials.
 
Particle Device Clinical Studies. 
 

The Company has conducted several biocompatibility animal studies. In the implantation study, no abnormal clinical signs were noted for any of the rabbits. The results of the sensitization study in guinea pigs showed a sensitization response equivalent to the negative controls. The results of the histological report on the rabbit skin biopsies clearly demonstrate structural integration of the particles into the host tissues by week 12. Evaluators observed the particle material integration with normal tissue, remodeled and/or new collagen, and fibroblasts throughout the injected particles, mild to no inflammation, and new collagen-matrix production.

A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) IDE approved pivotal human clinical trial was begun with CosmetaLife late in 2006. The clinical trial was a randomized, double blind, parallel assignment, multi-center comparison of the safety and efficacy of CosmetaLife versus Restylane® (Control) for the correction of nasolabial folds. One hundred seventy-one patients were skin tested and 145 were treated at six trial sites. The number of study exits after treatment totaled four subjects. This clinical trial was reported and published at www.clinicaltrial.gov (NCT00414544).
 
The feedback from physician investigators has been positive with respect to CosmetaLife injection qualities, cosmetic appearance, and its feel to the touch. During the first three to four months of the study, CosmetaLife showed no decrease in efficacy, as compared to Restylane that showed an 11 percent decrease in efficacy. The FDA/IDE approved human clinical trial for the CosmetaLife product through twelve months was found to be the same as compared to control hyaluronic acid product, Restylane (For each interval the consensus of the blinded subjects tested preferred CosmetaLife or showed no preference at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months).
 

CosmetaLife particles, shown in figure to the left, were photographed from a light microscope under high magnification. GDP particles were immersed in a saline solution to help disperse them for better viewing. These particles are approximately 100 microns in size (0.1 mm in diameter).

Gel-Del Technologies uses existing, scalable processes to reduce the infrastructure requirements and manufacturing risks to deliver a consistent high quality product while being responsive to volume requirements. Gel-Del is scaling the manufacturing process for Gel-Del Particles production, to date making batches in up to 2.0-kilogram quantities to near GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards acceptable for human clinical trials.
 
Particles Safety Study. Patients injected with CosmetaLife were found to have no or mild inflammatory, irritation, or immunogenic responses. These results suggest the particles are biocompatible because it closely matches the skin structure, composition, and moisture content. The no to low immunogenic responses are attributed to the tight cross-linking of the GDP matrix, which prevents immunogenic progenitor cells from producing antibodies.

In the clinical trial, the incidence of possible reaction to a skin test was 2.55 percent, with only one subject showing a reaction to a second test or 0.6%, (1 out of 171). We also have a study report by AppTec, Inc., our Contract Research Organization, that GDP (CosmetaLife) did not produce an antibody response during the clinical trial further supporting our belief that GDP is safe to use. Gel-Del Particles are composed of materials that approximately meet the Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) requirements of the FDA. GDP contains materials from certified bovine and porcine tissue sources that do not harbor prion disease or BSE. Additionally, steps in the manufacturing process have been validated for deactivating all viruses.

Extrusion force testing and the Clinical Trial usage both demonstrate the consistent and easy injection of GDP.
 
Twenty-five month stability testing shows that GDP is stable at room temperature conditions. Moreover, GDP has been shown to be stable at 40 °C (104 °F) conditions for at least 3 months.
 
Competition 
 
The development and commercialization of new animal health medicines is highly competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty animal health medicines companies. As a result, there are, and likely will continue to be, extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new animal health medicines. Our potential competitors include large animal health companies, such as Zoetis, Inc.; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Merial, the animal health division of Sanofi S.A.; Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Company; Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG; NAH, the animal health division of Novartis AG; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health, the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Virbac Group; Ceva Animal Health; Vetoquinol and Dechra Pharmaceuticals PLC. We are also aware of several smaller early stage animal health companies, such as Kindred Bio, Aratana Therapeutics Inc., NextVet and VetDC that are developing products for use in the pet therapeutics market.
